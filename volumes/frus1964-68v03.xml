                <p>The Foreign Relations of the United States series presents the official
                    documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and significant
                    diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The series documents the
                    facts and events that contributed to the formulation of policies and includes
                    evidence of supporting and alternative views to the policy positions ultimately
                    adopted.</p>
                <p>The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for
                    the preparation of the Foreign Relations series. The staff of the Office of the
                    Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans, researches, compiles, and edits the
                    volumes in the series. This documentary editing proceeds in full accord with the
                    generally accepted standards of historical scholarship. Official regulations
                    codifying specific standards for the selection and editing of documents for the
                    series were first promulgated by Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg on March
                    26, 1925. These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through
                    1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by
                    Public Law 102-138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992
                    and 1993, which was signed by President George Bush on October 28, 1991. Section
                    198 of P.L. 102-138 added a new Title IV to the Department of State's Basic
                    Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the Foreign Relations series be a thorough, accurate,
                    and reliable record of major United States foreign policy decisions and
                    significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the series should
                    include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major
                    foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government, including
                    facts that contributed to the formulation of policies and records that provided
                    supporting and alternative views to the policy positions ultimately adopted.</p>
                <p>The statute confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the
                    Foreign Relations series is guided by the principles of historical objectivity
                    and accuracy; records should not be altered or deletions made without indicating
                    in the published text that a deletion has been made; the published record should
                    omit no facts that were of major importance in reaching a decision; and nothing
                    should be omitted for the purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute
                    also requires that the Foreign Relations series be published not more than 30
                    years after the events recorded.</p>
                <p>The statute also requires that the published record in the Foreign Relations
                    series include all records needed to provide comprehensive <pb n="IV" xml:id="pg_IV" facs="0004"/>documentation on major foreign policy decisions
                    and actions of the U.S. Government. It further requires that government
                    agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government cooperate with
                    the Department of State Historian by providing full and complete access to
                    records pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing
                    copies of selected records.</p>
                <p>In preparing each volume of the Foreign Relations series, the editors are guided
                    by some general principles for the selection of documents. Each editor, in
                    consultation with the General Editor and other senior editors, determines the
                    particular issues and topics to be documented either in detail, in brief, or in
                    summary. Some general decisions are also made regarding issues that cannot be
                    documented in the volume but will be addressed in editorial or bibliographical
                    notes.</p>
                <p>The editors of this volume, which was originally compiled in 1984 and 1985 and
                    revised and updated in 1993 and 1994, are convinced that it meets all
                    regulatory, statutory, and scholarly standards of selection and editing.</p>
                <p>An explanation of the selection policy for the series and of this particular
                    volume and a detailed description of the sources available to the editors of the
                    series as well as a list of specific files consulted for this volume follow this
                    preface.</p>

                </p>
                <p>This volume is part of a subseries of volumes of the Foreign Relations series
                    that documents the most important issues in the foreign policy of the 5 years
                    (1964-1968) of the administration of <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.
                        Johnson</persName>. In planning and preparing the 1964-1968 subseries, the
                    editors chose to present the official record of U.S. foreign policy with respect
                    to Vietnam in seven volumes. Volume III (presented here) documents U.S. policy
                    toward Vietnam during the period from June 13, 1965, through December 31, 1965.
                    Volumes I, II, and IV through VII document U.S. policy toward Vietnam during the
                    following periods: I, 1964; II, January 1, 1965, through June 12, 1965; IV,
                    1966; V, 1967; and VI and VII, 1968.</p>
                <p>These seven volumes focus on Vietnam. They do not record activities in the rest
                    of mainland Southeast Asia except as they may relate immediately to the conduct
                    of the war in Vietnam. U.S. relations with Laos are documented in Volume
                    XXVIII.. U.S. relations with Cambodia, Thailand, Burma, and <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> are documented in Volume XXVII.</p>

                </p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the Foreign Relations statute, reviews records, advises, and makes
                    recommendations concerning the Foreign Relations series. The Advisory Committee
                    monitors the overall compilation and editorial <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0005"/>process of the series and assists with any access and/or
                    clearance problems that arise. Time constraints prevent the Advisory Committee
                    from reviewing all volumes in the series.</p>
                <p>This volume has not been reviewed by the Advisory Committee.</p>

                </p>
                <p>The declassification review of this volume resulted in the decision to withhold
                    .05 percent of the documentation originally selected; no documents were withheld
                    in their entirety. The documentation provides an accurate account of the main
                    lines of U.S. policy toward Vietnam during the June 13-December 31, 1965
                    period.</p>
                <p>The Division of Historical Documents Review of the Office of Freedom of
                    Information, Privacy, and Classification Review, Bureau of Administration,
                    Department of State, conducted the Department of State declassification review
                    of the documents published in this volume. The Declassification Coordination
                    Division of the Historian's Office coordinated the interagency and foreign
                    government declassification review. The review was conducted in accordance with
                    the standards set forth in Executive Order 12356 on National Security
                    Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>Under Executive Order 12356, information that concerns one or more of the
                    following categories, and the disclosure of which reasonably could be expected
                    to cause damage to the national security, requires classification:</p>
                <p>1) military plans, weapons, or operations;</p>
                <p>2) the vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, projects, or
                    plans relating to the national security;</p>
                <p>3) foreign government information;</p>
                <p>4) intelligence activities (including special activities), or intelligence
                    sources or methods;</p>
                <p>5) foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States;</p>
                <p>6) scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to national
                    security;</p>
                <p>7) U.S. Government programs for safeguarding nuclear materials or facilities;</p>
                <p>8) cryptology; or</p>
                <p>9) a confidential source.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security and law.
                    Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the appropriate geographic
                    and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other concerned agencies of
                    the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign governments regarding specific
                    documents of those governments.</p>

                    <hi rend="strong">Principles of Document Selection for the Foreign Relations
                        Series</hi>
                </p>
                <p>In preparing each volume of the Foreign Relations series, the editors are guided
                    by some general principles for the selection of documents. Each editor, in
                    consultation with the General Editor and other senior editors, determines the
                    particular issues and topics to be documented either in detail, in brief, or in
                    summary. Some general decisions are also made regarding issues that cannot be
                    documented in the volume but will be addressed in editorial or bibliographical
                    notes.</p>
                <p>The following general selection criteria are used in preparing volumes in the
                    Foreign Relations series. Individual compiler-editors vary these criteria in
                    accordance with the particular issues and the available documentation. The
                    compiler-editors also tend to apply these selection criteria in accordance with
                    their own interpretation of the generally accepted standards of scholarship. In
                    selecting documentation for publication, the editors gave priority to
                    unpublished classified records, rather than previously published records (which
                    are accounted for in appropriate bibliographical notes).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="strong">Selection Criteria</hi> (in general order of priority):</p>
                <p>1. Major foreign affairs commitments made on behalf of the United States to other
                    governments, including those that define or identify the principal foreign
                    affairs interests of the United States;</p>
                <p>2. Major foreign affairs issues, commitments, negotiations, and activities,
                    whether or not major decisions were made, and including dissenting or
                    alternative opinions to the process ultimately adopted;</p>
                <p>3. The decisions, discussions, actions, and considerations of the President, as
                    the official constitutionally responsible for the direction of foreign
                    policy;</p>
                <p>4. The discussions and actions of the National Security Council, the Cabinet, and
                    special Presidential policy groups, including the policy options brought before
                    these bodies or their individual members;</p>
                <p>5. The policy options adopted by or considered by the Secretary of State and the
                    most important actions taken to implement Presidential decisions or
                    policies;</p>
                <p>6. Diplomatic negotiations and conferences, official correspondence, and other
                    exchanges between U.S. representatives and those of other governments that
                    demonstrate the main lines of policy implementation on major issues;</p>
                <pb n="X" xml:id="pg_X" facs="0010"/>
                <p>7. Important elements of information that attended Presidential decisions and
                    policy recommendations of the Secretary of State;</p>
                <p>8. Major foreign affairs decisions, negotiations, and commitments undertaken on
                    behalf of the United States by government officials and representatives in other
                    agencies in the foreign affairs community or other branches of government made
                    without the involvement (or even knowledge) of the White House or the Department
                    of State;</p>
                <p>9. The main policy lines of intelligence activities if they constituted major
                    aspects of U.S. foreign policy toward a nation or region or if they provided key
                    information in the formulation of major U.S. policies;</p>
                <p>10. The role of the Congress in the preparation and execution of particular
                    foreign policies or foreign affairs actions;</p>
                <p>11. Economic aspects of foreign policy;</p>
                <p>12. The main policy lines of U.S. military and economic assistance as well as
                    other types of assistance;</p>
                <p>13. The political-military recommendations, decisions, and activities of the
                    military establishment and major regional military commands as they bear upon
                    the formulation or execution of major U.S. foreign policies;</p>
                <p>14. Documentation that illuminates special decisionmaking processes that
                    accomplished the policies recorded in particular volumes;</p>
                <p>15. Diplomatic appointments that reflect major policies or affect policy
                    changes.</p>

                    <hi rend="strong">Scope and Focus of Documents Researched and Selected for
                        Foreign Relations, 1964-1968, Volume III</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The editors developed the following six areas of focus for research and the
                    selection of documents for inclusion in this volume: 1) formulation of policy in
                    Washington, with particular emphasis on the decision to commit major ground
                    forces to Vietnam and its consequences for policy makers; 2) the advisory
                    process, including recommendations from key advisers in Washington, intelligence
                    assessments of the situation in Vietnam, and reporting and advice from U.S.
                    officials in Saigon; 3) efforts to negotiate a settlement to the Vietnam
                    conflict, other key diplomatic contacts, and the issue of bombing pauses; 4)
                    military planning and strategy and non-military programs in Vietnam; 5) the
                    relationship between the United States Government and the South Vietnamese
                    Government, including the issue of political instability in South Vietnam; and
                    6) the implementation of policy in South Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="strong">Editorial Methodology</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time or, in
                    the case of conferences, in the order of individual meetings. Incoming telegrams
                    from U.S. Missions are placed according to <pb n="XI" xml:id="pg_XI" facs="0011"/>time of receipt in the Department of State or other receiving agency, rather
                    than the time of transmission; memoranda of conversation are placed according to
                    the time and date of the conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was
                    drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the Foreign Relations series
                    follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by guidance from the General
                    Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text is reproduced as exactly
                    as possible, including marginalia or other notations, which are described in the
                    footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed according to accepted conventions
                    for the publication of historical documents in the limitations of modern
                    typography. A heading has been supplied by the editors for each document
                    included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation are retained
                    as found in the source text, except that obvious typographical errors are
                    silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the source text are
                    corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an
                    addition in roman type. Words or phrases underlined in the source text are
                    printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in the
                    source text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the front matter of each
                    volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were omitted. The amount of material omitted from this volume because
                    it was unrelated to the subject of the volume, however, has not been delineated.
                    All ellipses and brackets that appear in the source text are so identified by
                    footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document's source, original
                    classification, distribution, and drafting information. This footnote also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates if the
                    President or his major policy advisers read the document. Every effort has been
                    made to determine if a document has been previously published, and this
                    information has been included in the source footnote.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts have been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>

                <p>The Foreign Relations statute requires that the published record in the Foreign
                    Relations series include all records needed to provide comprehensive
                    documentation on major foreign policy decisions and actions of the U.S.
                    Government. It further requires that government agencies, departments, and other
                    entities of the U.S. Government cooperate with the Department of State Historian
                    by providing full and complete access to records pertinent to foreign policy
                    decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected records. The editors
                    believe that in terms of access this volume was prepared in accordance with the
                    standards and mandates of this statute, although access to some records was
                    restricted, as noted below.</p>
                <p>The editors have had complete access to all the retired records and papers of the
                    Department of State: the central files of the Department; the special
                    decentralized files (“lot files”) of the Department at the bureau, office, and
                    division levels; the files of the Department's Executive Secretariat, which
                    contain the records of international conferences and high-level official visits,
                    correspondence with foreign leaders by the President and Secretary of State, and
                    memoranda of conversations between the President and Secretary of State and
                    foreign officials; and the files of overseas diplomatic posts.
                    Intelligence-related files maintained by the Bureau of Intelligence and Research
                    became available to the Department historians only after this volume was
                    compiled. Arrangements have been made for Department historians to have access
                    to these records for future volumes; if any documentation relevant to this
                    volume is found, it may be included in a subsequent volume.</p>
                <p>The editors of the Foreign Relations series also have full access to the papers
                    of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and other White
                    House foreign policy records. Presidential papers maintained and preserved at
                    the Presidential libraries include some of the most significant foreign
                    affairs-related documentation from other federal agencies including the National
                    Security Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense,
                    the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the National Security Agency, and the United States
                    Information Agency. All of this documentation has been made available for use in
                    the Foreign Relations series thanks to the consent of these agencies and the
                    cooperation and support of the National Archives and Records Administration.</p>
                <p>The Department of State has arranged for access to the audiotapes of President
                        <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s telephone conversations
                    that are held at the Johnson Library. The first audiotapes became available to
                    the editors in late 1994, with most audiotapes, including those for the year
                    1965, to follow during 1995 and 1996. The editors decided not to delay
                    publication of this volume, <pb n="XIV" xml:id="pg_XIV" facs="0014"/>but if
                    relevant records are found among these telephone conversations, they may be
                    included in a later Foreign Relations volume.</p>
                <p>Department of State historians also have access to records of the Department of
                    Defense, particularly the records of the Secretaries of Defense and their major
                    assistants and the records of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The editors of this
                    volume also had access to the Papers of General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">William Westmoreland</persName> at the U.S. Army Center of Military History
                    and the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName> Library, the
                    Papers of General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Maxwell Taylor</persName> at the
                    National Defense University, the Papers of General <persName corresp="#p_JGH1">Harold Johnson</persName> at the U.S. Military History Institute, and the
                    Files of Assistant Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">John T.
                        McNaughton</persName> at the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.
                        Johnson</persName> Library.</p>
                <p>Since 1991, the Central Intelligence Agency has provided expanded access to
                    Department historians to high-level intelligence documents from those records
                    still in the custody of that Agency. Department of State historians' access is
                    arranged by the History Staff of the Center for the Study of Intelligence,
                    Central Intelligence Agency, pursuant to a May 1992 memorandum of understanding.
                    Department of State and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> historians continue
                    to work out the procedural and scholarly aspects of the access, and the variety
                    of documentation made available and selected for publication in the volumes has
                    expanded. The editors of this volume made particular use of the files of Deputy
                    Director of Central Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_HRN1">Richard
                        Helms</persName>.</p>

                    the Department of State changed its decimal central files to a subject-numeric
                    central file system. The subject-numeric system was divided into broad
                    categories: Administration, Consular, Culture and Information, Economic,
                    Political and Defense, Science, and Social. Within each of these divisions were
                    subject subcategories. For example, Political and Defense contained four
                    subtopics: <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> (Politics), <gloss target="#t_DEF1">DEF</gloss> (Defense), CSM (Communism), and INT

                        <p>1. There has been an extended exchange of messages regarding the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            threat, the requirement for US forces, the concept of their employment
                            and the details of their deployment. <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> proposes to treat each of these matters in an effort
                            to bring the picture into closer focus.</p>
                        <p>2. The threat. State message 2873, 11 June 1965,<note n="3" xml:id="d1fn3">See ibid., <ref target="frus1964-68v02#d337fn3">Document 337,
                                    footnote 3</ref>.</note> raises questions about <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>'s current estimate of the seriousness
                            of the situation in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. This message
                            will be answered separately by <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss>
                            reflecting <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> views. Suffice it to
                            say that <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> has lost five infantry
                            battalions on the battlefield in the last three weeks while rising
                            casualties and high desertion rates have caused a moratorium to be
                            proposed in connection with the formation of new battalions. Thus,
                                <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> battlefield strength is
                            declining in the face of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            reinforcements and a <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> offensive. It is
                                <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>'s considered opinion that
                                <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> cannot stand up to this
                            pressure without substantial US combat support on the ground.</p>
                        <p>3. Force requirements. <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> has asked
                            for added forces in ref A. These consist of two battalions to round out
                            the 3d Marine Division, a <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> division,
                            an airmobile division, the retention of the 173d Airborne Brigade,
                            tactical fighters and a corps headquarters plus combat and logistic
                            support forces. We have also flagged the possibility of additional
                            forces.</p>

                        <p>4. Concept of employment.</p>
                        <p>A. <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> analysis of the situation
                            and concept of operations is properly focussed upon the population—that
                            is, upon the people. There is no doubt whatsoever that the insurgency in
                            South Vietnam must eventually be defeated among the people in the
                            hamlets and towns. However, in order to defeat the insurgency among the
                            people, they must be provided security of two kinds:</p>
                        <p>(1) Security of the country as a whole from large well organized and
                            equipped forces including those which may come from outside their
                            country.</p>
                        <p>(2) Security from the guerrilla, the assassin, the terrorist and the
                            informer.</p>
                        <p>B. <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> is convinced that US troops can
                            contribute heavily in the first category of security as in paragraph
                            4A(1) above, but that only the Vietnamese can make real progress and
                            succeed in respect to the problem in paragraph 4A(2) above.
                            Unfortunately, the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> is being drawn
                            away from the people and their security in order to meet the challenge
                            of the main force <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> offensive. The best illustration of
                            this point is the fact that the II Corps Commander has removed most of
                            the troops from the province of Binh Dinh with its nearly one million
                            people in order to defend the relatively less important province
                            capitals of Kontum and Pleiku. Therefore, the <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> concept is basically to employ US forces together with
                            Vietnamese airborne and marine battalions of the general reserve against
                            the hardcore <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> forces in reaction and search and destroy operations,
                            and thus permit the concentration of Vietnamese troops in the heavily
                            populated areas along the coast, around Saigon and in the Delta.</p>
                        <p>C. We have tailored logistic support forces to provide for some tactical
                            flexibility so that forces may be shifted in accordance with the
                            strength and movement of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.
                            Continuous adjustments and redistributions undoubtedly will be
                            necessary. It is likely that the war will continue to become more fluid
                            and more mobile. We believe that the major bases at Da Nang, Chu Lai,
                            Qui Nhon, Cam Ranh and Saigon-Bien Hoa provide the backbone support on
                            which mobile forces can be supported and from which they can
                            maneuver.</p>
                        <p>D. It is not our concept that the US would take exclusive control of
                            responsibility for any entire province although, in practice, only token
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces might remain. Thus
                            generally, we must match our forces with the territorial organization of
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. We must strengthen and support
                            the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> structure to keep it alive
                            and operative. We should generally concentrate US forces away from major
                            population centers and whenever possible do the bulk of our fighting in
                            more remote areas.</p>

                        <p>5. Deployments.</p>
                        <p>A. <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> recognizes that the in-country
                            location of ground combat forces has a bearing upon the size, nature and
                            location of logistic support forces, ports, airfields and related
                            facilities. For this reason, <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> has
                            indicated from time to time the proposed initial location of the combat
                            forces for which requirements have developed. However, as the number of
                            combat forces requested and required increases and the number of
                            combinations and permutations regarding location correspondingly
                            increases, we rapidly approach a point where everyone will be confused
                            and no useful purpose will be served.</p>
                        <p>B. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are now maneuvering large forces
                            up to reinforce regiments equipped with heavy weapons. Thus, we are
                            approaching the kind of warfare faced by the French in the latter stages
                            of their efforts here. It is entirely possible that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> can and will deploy three or more
                            divisions into South Vietnam by infiltration. It is highly likely that
                            one is already here. Therefore, it will be necessary to react to the
                            introduction of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> forces and to the
                            shift and tactical play of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. Thus,
                            tactical dispositions will change and only the major bases will be
                            fixed. In short, we will be conducting mobile warfare from fixed and
                            defended bases. Some of these bases will be major logistics centers at
                            ports and airfields such as Chu Lai and Cam Ranh. Others will be
                            tactical bases such as An Khe or Pleiku, the tactical bases will move as
                            necessary and that may be with some frequency as the battle
                            develops.</p>
                        <p>C. With these thoughts in mind, a <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>
                            review of the tactical situation corps-by-corps will indicate the
                            probable deployment of required US forces:</p>
                        <p>(1) I Corps. This corps is highly vulnerable to the introduction of
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> forces. It has virtually no
                            reserve and is barely able to hold the major population centers,
                            province and district towns. We believe that the 3d Marine Division
                            augmented by two battalions as recommended can provide adequate reserve
                            reaction forces for I Corps at the present level of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> activity. With a full division, the
                            equivalent of one <gloss target="#t_BLT1">BLT</gloss> will be available
                            for employment throughout the corps in a reaction role away from the
                            base area.</p>
                        <p>(2) II Corps. This corps has a hopelessly large area to cover with the
                            meager forces available. Additionally, the Vietnamese have a fixation on
                            the importance of Kontum and Pleiku, probably derived from the history
                            of the Viet Minh war. Recently, the corps commander has denuded Binh
                            Dinh Province (with nearly a million inhabitants) in order to reinforce
                            Kontum with two marine battalions. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            control Phu Yen Province except for Tuy Hoa itself and, as reported
                            earlier, the 325th Division may be deployed in Kontum, Pleiku and Phu
                            Bon. The 23d Division is scattered so widely that it cannot react in
                            strength to <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> attacks against isolated
                            province capitals and district towns. We are greatly concerned <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0036"/>that such towns as Ham Tan in Binh Tuy
                            and Gia Nghia in Quang Duc and even Phan Thiet in Binh Thuan may be
                            attacked. Corps commanders without adequate reserves have shown
                            conclusive evidence that they will move timidly and too late in a
                            piecemeal manner upon the event of a <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            heavy attack. This is resulting in the loss of <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> battalions faster than they can be organized, trained
                            and equipped. II Corps requires heavy reinforcements. We have asked for
                            an infantry brigade, an airmobile division and a <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> division. We would generally employ these forces as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>(A) The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s appear to be sensitive to
                            the possibility of heavy casualties and would be pleased, we believe, to
                            take over the security mission at the major logistic bases of Cam Ranh
                            and Qui Nhon. Although two <gloss target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss>s are not
                            required for the defense of Qui Nhon, they can profitably be used there
                            to extend the secure area and reinforce the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> in that populous and important province. If only one
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss> becomes available, we would employ
                            it to relieve the 1st Division Brigade at Qui Nhon and Cam Ranh.</p>
                        <p>(B) Having been relieved by the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s of
                            the security of Qui Nhon and Cam Ranh, we visualize the employment of
                            the 1st Division Brigade in the general area of Highway 19 west of Qui
                            Nhon toward An Khe. The security of Route 19 is important not only in
                            the event of the deployment of major US forces on the high plateau, but
                            is equally essential for the support of the population in that area and
                            for the delivery of <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> for current
                            combat operations. The fact is that Highway 19 must be kept open. There
                            is no feasible way into the high plateau from north or south. If the
                            plateau is abandoned, it will form the first significant territory of
                            the NFLSVN and will be recognized and supported by China through
                            Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>(C) We believe that Route 19 and the Pleiku-Kontum area present a
                            challenge which must be met. We do not believe that the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> can do the job. If the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> elect to fight a major campaign for Route
                            19 with <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> forces, this is as good terrain as any, and better than
                            most, on which such a battle should take place. It is vastly preferable
                            to the populated lowlands. The problem in Vietnam has always been one of
                            finding, fixing and fighting successfully the elusive <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. If Route [garble—19] becomes a magnet,
                            it tends to solve several of these problems. With the mobility,
                            communication and firepower of the air assault division supported by
                            tactical air, we believe the battle of the road will be won and that the
                            road can be used by the division. The division can be supported over the
                            road for the bulk of its requirements, and can be backed up as necessary
                            by a <gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss>-130 squadron on a contingency
                            basis, augmented by <gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss>-123 and Caribou, as
                            well as Chinook helicopters which are organic to the division. The air
                            assault division consumes <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>,
                            ammunition, food and miscellaneous supplies at a rate which varies from
                            600 tons at the maximum to <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0037"/>100 tons
                            or less at the minimum. When all aircraft are flying at the maximum rate
                            and ammunition expenditures are the highest conceivable in this kind of
                            war, the division might hit the 600 ton requirement. If on the other
                            hand it is necessary to pull in the belt—defend the hard bases, curtail
                            both flying and shooting—then the consumption comes down dramatically.
                            In short, the division can subsist easily on air resupply while
                            relatively inactive and yet defend itself. We would have a corps force
                            with one US and one <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> division
                            operating in the northern half of II Corps. This would permit the
                            regrouping of the 22d and 23d Divisions so that more ample coverage
                            could be provided in the south and would provide the kind of reaction
                            force required to meet and defeat major <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> attacks. The foregoing deployment relates to the
                            situation as we know it now. If that situation changes or additional
                            forces are introduced by the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, these
                            forces will be shifted correspondingly.</p>
                        <p>(3) III Corps. This corps is extremely weak on its northern and eastern
                            flanks and has inadequate reserves to react to heavy VC attacks
                            particularly in isolated areas. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            attacks in Phuoc Long Province on 10 and 12 June illustrated the dire
                            consequences of a piecemeal commitment of small battalions against a
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> regiment in an intelligence
                            vacuum. There are no prospects of additional <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> forces in the near future. Thus, we foresee the
                            eventual requirement for a full US division northeast of Saigon to meet
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> threat as it is now constituted.
                            In the meanwhile, we wish to retain the 173d Airborne Brigade after the
                            arrival of the brigade of the 101st Airborne Division. If for some
                            reason the airmobile division is not deployed, we would station one of
                            the airborne brigades at Pleiku.</p>
                        <p>(4) IV Corps. At the moment, this corps is standing on its own two feet.
                            The terrain in IV Corps lends itself to the full use of air mobility and
                            the absence of cover compounds the difficulty of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. The units of the 7th and 21st Divisions
                            have attained a high state of morale and certain units have achieved an
                            outstanding record against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. We
                            consider that, although the margin is favorable, it is certainly thin.
                            Whether or not US forces will be required in this area cannot now be
                            forecast.</p>
                        <p>6. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are destroying battalions faster
                            than they can be reconstituted and faster than they were planned to be
                            organized under the buildup program. The <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> commanders do not believe that they can survive
                            without the active commitment of US ground combat forces. The only
                            possible US response is the aggressive employment of US troops together
                            with Vietnamese general reserve forces to react against strong <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            attacks. To meet this challenge successfully, troops must be maneuvered
                            freely, deployed and redeployed if necessary, and the challenge of
                            Highway 19 and the high plateau must be met.</p>

                        <p>Curious calm has settled over Saigon in wake of military's return to
                            power. No one (including military) appears to have clear idea what form

                            governmental structure or personnel thus there have been no significant
                            developments since Friday night. <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_Do1">Do</persName> and

                            they feel they are still very much in picture and in position strongly
                            to influence final outcome. (A very definite element in our ability to
                            obtain information is what <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bui

                            that they have not been able to make a go of civilian government.)</p>
                        <p>Civilian politicians are beginning to stir somewhat and their activity
                            should increase sharply within next few days as they attempt to sell

                        </p>
                        <p>While it remains too early to assess with any precision the extent to
                            which this ferment is widely shared among key individuals, there are
                            certain characteristics to the attitude which might be noted: (a) its
                            proponents are younger men who tend to be from the center or north and
                            to share an intellectual affinity with Thich Tri Quang; (b) the attitude
                            is strongly nationalistic with overtones of xenophobia; (c) it has a
                            sense of disillusion with what is regarded as recent experiment with
                            more democratic way of life, it desires to see concrete results rapidly
                            taken through decisive governmental action; (d) it is, therefore,
                            authoritarian; (e) it tends to oversimplify difficulty of complex
                            questions and ability of antiquated bureaucracy to perform.</p>
                        <p>In short, this attitude is, as it claims, both revolutionary and
                            ultranationalistic, holding belief common in underdeveloped world that
                            decisive action must be taken by governmental decision without undue
                            concern for counter considerations. Such government likely be hard on
                            local ethnic Chinese and French interests. It would be hard on
                            “Sudistes” particularly French educated “bourgeois”. Catholic attitudes
                            in turn likely be shaped by degree government able effectively prosecute
                            war plus indications of govt attitude towards them. It would probably
                            present some difficulties in its relations with <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and from standpoint US public opinion.</p>
                        <p>It remains to be seen, however, whether attitude is really dominant, if
                            it is, whether it can remain so, whether it can successfully handle
                            opposition it will tend to create, and whether it can produce results it
                            demands. Most likely prospect is that strong revolutionary flavor will
                            be watered down when government attempts frame realistic goals and
                            policies and galvanize torpid administrative apparatus.</p>
                        <p>Part II.</p>
                        <p>Embassy inclined to feel that “revolutionary” label might be useful
                            device for new govt to adopt to help it overcome apathy which many of
                            populace might feel at yet another governmental change. If govt can
                            successfully sell itself as “revolutionary” and get off the mark with a
                            specific program, it might well be in position to move somewhat more
                            effectively toward solving many of nagging problems (e.g., conscription,
                            rice deliveries, irresponsible press situation) which have plagued its
                            predecessors. However, it in turn will continue to be plagued by the
                            deep seated <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0040"/>inefficiencies of the
                            administrative structure. To be in position to do this, govt would need
                            some new faces and probably a new chief executive. But it is hard to see
                            who they might be. Although Quat might be retained in some capacity, if
                            revolutionary label is to have currency at all, someone new must head
                            the ticket, but the person has not yet emerged. Possible he does not
                            exist.</p>
                        <p>As for governmental structure, it seems likely, based on current
                            fragmentary information, that revolutionary govt will have some things
                            in common with Minh-Tho govt that held power from Nov 1963 to Jan 30,
                            1964. Differences are essentially that this time military committee
                            superimposed over govt will be smaller, presumably more wieldy body, and
                            that govt, on basis experience other govts since Nov 2, 1963, will not
                            be as diffident as Tho govt of technicians. It essential that executive
                            under military committee act without bucking every question to military
                            for decision. For efficiency executive should be single individual
                            rather than executive committee as some have proposed.</p>
                        <p>As adjunct to this govt, we believe that religious council should be
                            established. (<persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> had intended
                            to form such body with representation drawn from all major religious
                            groups.) This consultative body would not act as a legislative body, but
                            would be brought in to handle any incidents of religious friction and
                            would have an advisory voice in the drafting of legislation affecting
                            the religions.</p>
                        <p>Hopefully it could to some degree develop as a forum in which
                            inter-religious fears and suspicions could have some airing.</p>
                        <p>(For the moment Catholics and Sudistes can be expected to scrutinize
                            emerging government with wary eye. Catholics will be most unhappy if
                                <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>-Lieu [<hi rend="italic">Thieu</hi>]
                            combination appears clearly to be dominant and consolidating their
                            position, particularly in the security services, and if efforts are not
                            made to appease their suspicions that anti-Catholic actions are in
                            works. Southerners will tend to interpret developments as consolidation
                            of north-center political control, unless there is reasonable
                            regional/religious balance in eventual Cabinet. Same attitudes likely
                            prevail among <persName corresp="#p_Cao1">Cao Dai</persName> and Hoa
                            Hao, although these groups will remain split in prevailing factions. In
                            short, groupings opposition to <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> will remain potential opposition, depending on
                            their assessment of strength of Generals' intentions, steps may be taken
                            to appease their interests, and possible momentum shown by new
                            government in prosecuting the war.)</p>
                        <p>As for any type of legislative body, we feel that decision on this should
                            be deferred. If, after its establishment, govt draws heavy critical fire
                            from “out” politicians, it might prove useful to provide them with forum
                            such as Council of Notables in which they can talk without being able to
                            do much harm. For the future, we feel that govt should go on <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0041"/>record promising elections to a
                            constituent assembly in about one year's time in order channel energies

                        <p>Unless Dept has some reservations on any of foregoing points in Part II,
                            we would propose to bring what influence we can bring to bear in

                            chance. We should tell him what we would like to do—“The <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> Plan”<note n="5" xml:id="d3fn5">See vol. II, <ref target="frus1964-68v02#d287">Document 287</ref>.</note>—we will

                            trouble if we don't take him with us. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he would talk with him. President advised
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> get his plan ahead of
                            time. Tell Mac to send the Tito memorandum of four or five weeks

                            President didn't know how we could sell something like this in this
                            country. Dick Russell will back us up, although he is afraid of the
                            ground troop thing. <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> is
                            unhappy. President told him he wanted a united front; he does not want
                            to be a dictator. If they will write the policy the President will try
                            to execute it; he will consider their thoughts. They could put in a
                            resolution or whatever they want. If they get the Committee Members
                            together we are willing to explain everything and provide them all the
                            debate they want. President advised <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> to put it to <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> hard; he thinks he is ready to go with us; he
                            just wants to have something after the monsoon. President told <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> to get anybody he wanted, either
                            in the Government or outside. Pick up the phone and tell him you will
                            send a plane and get him down here for a talk.</p>
                        <p>President said he wanted to get off the San Francisco hook.<note n="7" xml:id="d3fn7">See <ref target="#d19fn3">footnote 3, Document

                            following message has been passed to Derek Mitchell for the Prime
                            Minister:</p>
                        <p>1. The President is keenly interested in the Prime Minister's imaginative
                            proposal for a mission of Prime Ministers,<note n="2" xml:id="d4fn2">See
                                    <ref target="#d6">Document 6</ref>.</note> and has just asked me
                            to make sure the Prime Minister has full information on the President's
                            own thinking about Vietnam at this stage. It is obvious that it is of
                            the highest importance for our two governments to mesh their decisions
                            and statements with great care in order to get the full advantage of our
                            respective actions.</p>
                        <p>2. I think <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> has already told
                            you we cannot move up the proposed special bombing operation in South
                            Vietnam without weakening the plans for a prompt follow-up on the
                            ground. A postponement would be manageable, but does not seem to help
                            the Prime Minister. Accordingly, we think it best to proceed on
                            schedule, but we will quite understand if the Prime Minister thinks it
                            wise to conduct his discussions with other Prime Ministers in such a way
                            as to leave them in no doubt of his belief that the Americans are
                            determined to make increasing use of appropriate conventional weapons
                            against concentrations of Viet Cong armed forces. We will also make it
                            clear that this operation and the London proposal are wholly separate
                            and unrelated in their origins.</p>
                        <p>3. I think Ambassador Dean also knows in a general way of our thinking
                            about additional ground force deployments. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> will today be explaining our existing decisions
                            to enlarge our number of ground force battalions to 13, with supporting
                            air and logistic strength such that the overall force strength in South
                            Vietnam will be about 70,000. He will also explain that while no further
                            decisions have been taken, we<pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0044"/>
                            expect to do what is necessary in South Vietnam. Within the next week or
                            so the President is likely to face decisions which may lead to further
                            deployments which would bring total U.S. forces there to a level between
                            90 and 100,000. (This last figure is for the Prime Minister's private
                            guidance only; it is obviously extraordinarily sensitive and could
                            easily be changed upward or downward after further analysis here.)</p>
                        <p>These deployments again are in response to the overall increase in Viet
                            Cong numbers and activity which has been developing over many
                            months.</p>
                        <p>4. It is also probable that as the monsoon season continues, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> will find it
                            necessary to use his discretionary authority to commit U.S. ground
                            forces to supporting combat action. Such a commitment very nearly
                            occurred in recent days in the area of Dong Xoai and might occur at any
                            time from now onward.</p>
                        <p>5. The President continues to reject the proposals which are urged by
                            some in this country for radical extension of the bombing operations
                            against North Vietnam. In particular, the operations are still carefully
                            limited to military targets in which danger to civilians is minimized.
                            The President has never believed that bombing would bring Hanoi to the
                            conference table on the run. He believes rather that the real contest is
                            in the south and the purpose of the bombing has been to interfere with
                            supply and support from the north, and to give clear evidence to both
                            sides in the south of American determination and strength. These limited
                            objectives are being met and no unlimited objectives are being
                            substituted for them.</p>
                        <p>6. The President equally rejects the notion of withdrawal and
                            abandonment. This is not a point which needs to be argued to the Prime
                            Minister.</p>
                        <p>7. A third course of action is simply to allow the increasing efforts of
                            the Viet Cong in the south to go without effective reply. This course
                            has also been rejected. The increased efforts which we will be making
                            will, however, remain within the framework of our determination to
                            support and assist the Vietnamese themselves.</p>
                        <p>8. We have made repeated efforts to get this dangerous business into a
                            conference room. The record of intransigence in Hanoi and Peking is
                            clear, and our own judgment is that no different answer can be expected
                            until after the monsoon fighting. Nevertheless, the President welcomes
                            the readiness of the Prime Minister to make another try. The President
                            fully agrees with the view of the Prime Minister and of Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRG1">Robert Menzies</persName> that even if the
                            mission fails in its immediate purpose, it should succeed in showing
                            just where the responsibility lies.</p>
                        <p>9. So far, I have spoken of the President's own thinking. Let me, in
                            closing, report that I talked with Oliver Wright about the cease-fire
                            question which was discussed between the Prime Minister and <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>. I have <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0045"/>not yet had a chance to discuss this
                            with the President, but my guess is that he would strongly prefer to
                            have any explicit discussion in this area start from here. The great
                            difficulty about a cease-fire is that the U.S. can easily stop what it
                            is doing by a single order and the results can be seen immediately.
                            Terror and subversion and infiltration are not so easily monitored. We
                            keep a continuing review of the possibility of actions and proposals in
                            this field, however, and we fully understand the importance which might
                            attach to this question in the light of other events scheduled for
                            June.</p>

                        <p>4220. For the President. My first action upon returning from Washington
                            was to seek out Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>, General <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> to find out the meaning of the action of the Quat

                            The American General officer closest to him describes him as “a proud

                            politician and civil affairs administrator. I believe he will do his
                            absolute best to succeed in his new position, but he will require a lot
                            of technical assistance, moral support and a normal amount of
                            conscientious understanding.” We will do our best to provide these

                        <p>Second only to the importance of the political situation is the military.
                            As you know, the Viet Cong monsoon offensive is clearly on, marked by
                            another large battle (as Vietnamese battles go) at the district town of
                            Dong Xoai. As in the engagement near Quang Ngai on May 29, the Viet Cong
                            here sought to destroy regular <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            forces and were willing to take heavy losses to accomplish this
                            objective. They succeeded to the extent of about two battalion
                            equivalents of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> casualties. The
                            performance of the Vietnamese troops in this very hot engagement appears
                            to have been first rate.</p>
                        <p>It is clear that the primary objective of the Viet Cong is to chew up the
                            regular forces of South Viet-Nam and to cause their attrition to a point
                            where major geographic objectives can be taken and held for considerable
                            periods of time. They are counting upon the habitual reaction of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to come to the aid of remote
                            posts attacked in areas favorable to Viet Cong ambushes. Since <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces come by helicopter with limited
                            cargo lift, inevitably they arrive piecemeal on the battlefield and too
                            often suffer heavy casualties upon landing.</p>
                        <p>As a result, over the past three weeks, the number of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> ineffective units has risen from two
                            regiments and three battalions to four regiments and nine battalions.
                            Ineffectiveness is caused largely by under-strength conditions resulting
                            from battle losses.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> is
                            thoroughly aware of the problem and is studying new tactics to cope with
                            the Viet Cong. Unfortunately, they are presenting us with two
                            alternatives, both unattractive, either to intervene piecemeal as in the
                            past and take the casualties, or to concede the loss of remote towns
                            difficult to defend. While these towns are not important in terms of
                            population, the effect of abandoning them can have a serious effect on
                            national morale.</p>

                        <p>It is unfortunate that the present political instability and the Viet
                            Cong offensive coincide with preparations for the Algiers conference

                        <p>Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote: “Things are in the saddle, and ride
                            mankind.”</p>
                        <p>Your most difficult continuing problem in South Viet-Nam is to prevent
                            “things” from getting into the saddle—or, in other words, to keep
                            control of policy and prevent the momentum of events from taking
                            command.</p>
                        <p>The best formula for maintaining freedom of decision is (a) to limit our
                            commitments in time and magnitude and (b) to establish specific time
                            schedules for the selection of optional courses of action on the basis
                            of pre-established criteria.</p>
                        <p rend="center">II.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Outline of Specific Proposals</p>
                        <p>The North Vietnamese are apparently using the monsoon season as a test
                            period to determine whether they can impose enough local defeats to
                            demoralize the South Vietnamese and discourage the United States.</p>
                        <p>I propose that we also treat the monsoon season as a test period since we
                            do not yet have enough experience with the direct employment of American
                            combat forces to appraise our chances for military success in the
                            South.</p>
                        <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0049"/>
                        <p>But in launching a vigorous effort to halt the Viet Cong offensive during
                            the monsoon period you should at the same time make it clear to your key
                            advisers that, at the conclusion of that period, we will take a serious
                            look at our accumulated experience and decide whatever long-range course
                            of policy or action is indicated.</p>
                        <p>For the fact is—and we can no longer avoid it—that, in spite of our
                            intentions to the contrary, we are drifting toward a major war—that
                            nobody wants.</p>
                        <p>I recommend, therefore, the following program:</p>
                        <p>1. Decide now to authorize an increase of American forces in South
                            Viet-Nam to an aggregate level of 100,000—but no more—additional forces.
                            These should be deployed as rapidly as possible in order to deal with
                            the Viet Cong offensive during the rainy season.</p>
                        <p>2. Instruct your top advisers—limited in this case, for security reasons,
                            to the Secretaries of State and Defense (and possibly also the Chairman
                            of the Joint Chiefs):</p>
                        <p>(a) that you are not committing US forces on an open-ended basis to an
                            all-out land war in South Viet-Nam;</p>
                        <p>(b) that instead you are making a controlled commitment for a trial
                            period of three months;</p>
                        <p>(c) that on the basis of our experience during that trial period we will
                            then appraise the costs and possibilities of waging a successful land
                            war in South Viet-Nam and chart a clear course of action
                            accordingly;</p>
                        <p>(d) that, during the test period, in publicly stating American aims and
                            purposes, American spokesmen should emphasize our willingness to stay in
                            South Viet-Nam so long as we are wanted (a qualification that has tended
                            to become submerged in recent months); and</p>
                        <p>(e) that, in carrying out this limited decision, your advisers
                            should—during the three-months period—press the war on the ground in
                            South Viet-Nam as vigorously as possible, while seeking quietly and
                            effectively to avoid those longer-term actions and commitments that
                            would reduce your freedom of decision at the end of the period.</p>
                        <p>3. Direct your top advisers to prepare the following plans:</p>
                        <p>(a) A plan for continuing the land war in South Viet-Nam on a stepped-up
                            basis;</p>
                        <p>(b) A plan for conducting a vigorous diplomatic offensive designed to
                            bring about a political settlement; and</p>
                        <p>(c) Plans for bringing about a military or political solution—short of
                            the ultimate US objectives—that can be attained without the substantial
                            further commitment of US forces. These last should be regarded as plans
                            for cutting losses and eventually disengaging from an untenable
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>The reasoning underlying these proposals and the manner in which they
                            might be carried out are elaborated in the balance of this
                            memorandum.</p>

                        <p>Where We Are Now—On the Threshold of a New War</p>
                        <p>In raising our commitment from 50,000 to 100,000 or more men and
                            deploying most of the increment in combat roles we are beginning a new
                            war—the United States directly against the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the large-scale introduction of American forces with their
                            concentrated fire power will force Hanoi and the Viet Cong to the
                            decision we are seeking. On the other hand, we may not be able to fight
                            the war successfully enough—even with 500,000 Americans in South
                            Viet-Nam—to achieve this purpose.</p>
                        <p>Before we commit an endless flow of forces to South Viet-Nam we must have
                            more evidence than we now have that our troops will not bog down in the
                            jungles and rice paddies—while we slowly blow the country to pieces.</p>
                        <p>A review of the French experience more than a decade ago may be
                            helpful.</p>
                        <p>The French fought a war in Viet-Nam, and were finally defeated—after
                            seven years of bloody struggle and when they still had 250,000
                            combat-hardened veterans in the field, supported by an army of 205,000
                            South Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>To be sure, the French were fighting a colonial war while we are fighting
                            to stop aggression. But when we have put enough Americans on the ground
                            in South Viet-Nam to give the appearance of a white man's war, the
                            distinction as to our ultimate purpose will have less and less practical
                            effect.</p>
                        <p>Nor is our position in Viet-Nam without its historical ambiguities. From
                            1948-1954 we identified ourselves with the French by providing almost $4
                            billions of United States aid to help the French in Indochina wage war
                            against the Viet Minh. As soon as our aid contributions began to mount,
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> denounced
                            American “imperialism”.</p>
                        <p>This campaign of denunciation was continued over the radio and through
                            other propaganda media after the French withdrew and we began to help
                            President <persName corresp="#p_Diem1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Today no one can say for certain how many Vietnamese are for us or
                            against us. We have trouble collecting intelligence because few
                            Vietnamese are willing to risk their necks to aid the American effort.
                            And our popularity will diminish even further as we are forced to
                            indulge in more and more area bombing, crop burning, etc.</p>
                        <p>Ever since 1961—the beginning of our deep involvement in South
                            Viet-Nam—we have met successive disappointments. We have tended to
                            underestimate the strength and staying-power of the enemy. We have
                            tended to overestimate the effectiveness of our sophisticated weapons
                            under jungle conditions. We have watched the progressive loss of
                            territory <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19" facs="0051"/>to Viet Cong control.
                            We have been unable to bring about the creation of a stable political
                            base in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>This is no one's fault. It is in the nature of the struggle.</p>
                        <p>The French had much the same experience.</p>
                        <p>They quoted the same kind of statistics that guide our
                            opinions—statistics as to the number of Viet Minh killed, the number of
                            enemy defectors, the rate of enemy desertions, etc. They fully believed
                            that the Vietnamese people were on their side, and their hopes received
                            intermittent shots of adrenaline from a succession of projects for
                            winning the war—the De Lattre de Tassigny Plan, the Salan Plan, the
                            Navarre Plan, etc.</p>
                        <p>This does not mean that we cannot succeed where the French did not; we
                            have things running for us that the French did not have. But we cannot
                            yet be sure—and that is the reason for the trial period.</p>
                        <p>For we have not so far seen enough evidence to be sure that the South
                            Vietnamese forces will stand up under the heightening pressure—or, in
                            fact, that the Vietnamese people really have a strong will to fight
                            after twenty years of struggle. We cannot be sure how far the cancer has
                            infected the whole body politic of South Viet-Nam and whether we can do
                            more than administer a cobalt treatment to a terminal case.</p>
                        <p>Yet the more forces we deploy in South Viet-Nam—particularly in combat
                            roles—the harder we shall find it to extricate ourselves without
                            unacceptable costs if the war goes badly.</p>
                        <p>With large forces committed, the failure to turn the tide will generate
                            pressures to escalate. There will be mounting domestic demands that we
                            expand our air attacks on the North so as to destroy Hanoi and Haiphong.
                            Yet if our air attacks threaten the total destruction of the North
                            Vietnamese economy, Red China can hardly help but react. And our best
                            Soviet experts do not believe that the Soviet Union could stand down in
                            the event that we became involved directly with the Chinese.</p>

                        <p>If—on a careful appraisal of all the evidence accumulated during the test
                            period—you are satisfied that United States military power can stop and
                            throw back the Viet Cong without unacceptable United States losses, you
                            are then in position to decide on a longer-term aggressive strategy, of
                            which the elements would be:</p>
                        <p>(a) to commit whatever force is needed to do the job in South Viet-Nam as
                            quickly and cheaply as possible;</p>
                        <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0052"/>
                        <p>(b) to continue our air attacks on North Viet-Nam but avoiding the
                            Hanoi-Haiphong complex and keeping well south of the Chinese border;</p>
                        <p>(c) to renew your assurances to the South Vietnamese and the world of our
                            intention to stay the course; and</p>
                        <p>(d) to initiate the <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> plan
                            and increase our diplomatic probes through third parties and a judicious
                            use of pauses—while encouraging efforts of friendly countries to bring
                            the North Vietnamese to the conference table.</p>
                        <p>All of this is, of course, contingent on the continued maintenance of a
                            minimum level of political stability in Saigon.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Actions if the Fight Goes Badly.</p>
                        <p>If the evidence accumulated during the test period provides no reasonable
                            assurance that the United States can conduct a successful land war in
                            South Viet-Nam without a vast protracted effort, you should seek means
                            of limiting the American commitment and finding a political solution at
                            a level below the total achievement of our declared objectives.</p>
                        <p>There are several ways of achieving this—none fully satisfactory. But a
                            good general picks his own terrain and is prepared to execute tactical
                            redeployments when events require it. Similarly, it is a part of good
                            statesmanship to cut losses when the pursuit of particular courses of
                            action threaten (a) to lead to a costly and indeterminate result; or (b)
                            to produce an escalation of violence that could result in a major
                            war.</p>
                        <p>The technique of cutting our losses requires intensive study. No one has
                            yet looked at the problem carefully since we have been unwilling to
                            think in those terms. I would suggest, however, that there are several
                            alternative possibilities which should be carefully examined.</p>
                        <p>(a) Reducing Our Military Commitment</p>
                        <p>The first is to devise a plan for limiting the defense perimeter within
                            South Viet-Nam to the cities and major towns—particularly those having
                            access to the sea. This would deny to the Viet Cong the administrative,
                            commercial and industrial heart of the country.</p>
                        <p>(b) Letting Nature Take Its Course</p>
                        <p>A second approach is subtly to withdraw moral and political support from
                            the Government in Saigon. In this way the non-Communist and neutralist
                            forces might be encouraged to work out some sort of compromise with the
                            Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>Such an operation would require great finesse. However, the Saigon
                            Government is becoming more and more a fiction—in real terms South
                            Viet-Nam has an army but no government.</p>
                        <p>While putting in train any operation of disengagement we should, of
                            course, simultaneously take steps to strengthen our position in Thailand
                            and to create a diplomatic atmosphere around the world that would
                            minimize the costs of US withdrawal. To do this, we would rely heavily
                                <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0053"/>on the qualified nature of
                            our commitment—to help defend the South Vietnamese so long—but only so
                            long—as they wished our help.</p>
                        <p>(c) Other Possibilities</p>
                        <p>As a third possibility, we might consider variant means by which there
                            might emerge a South Vietnamese determination to go it alone. One
                            approach might be to encourage our friends to call for elections in
                            South Viet-Nam in order to permit self-determination by a people engaged
                            in civil war. Another might be to let our friends crank up a
                            fourteen-nation conference.</p>
                        <p>During the past weeks we have concentrated on seeking a political
                            solution that would fully meet our stated objectives in South Viet-Nam.
                            Such a solution will not be feasible so long as the Viet Cong are
                            winning or believe they are winning. Since we cannot yet be sure that we
                            will be able to beat the Viet Cong without unacceptable costs, we would
                            be prudent to undertake an additional study of the political means to
                            achieve less than a satisfactory solution—or, in other words, a solution
                            involving concessions on our side as well as the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>The above suggestions are of the most preliminary kind. I am sure that
                            other possibilities could be developed.</p>

                            exists within the Soviet leadership. (Very doubtful, on the evidence of
                            May.)</p>
                        <p>4. It will permit a more careful testing of Hanoi's interest in
                            negotiations, if any such inclination exists.</p>
                        <p>5. It will meet one persistent demand of our domestic critics and
                            waverers.</p>
                        <p>6. It will ease the mounting domestic pressures on our allies (primarily
                            the British and the Japanese, but also the Australians and Canadians) to
                            stop their support of our Vietnam policy.</p>
                        <p>7. It will meet some persistent objections of unaligned nations and
                            leaders (primarily the Indians and U Thant).</p>
                        <p>8. It will somewhat de-fuse the Algerian meeting by strengthening our
                            supporters and putting the heat on our adversaries.</p>

                            weakened Saigon Government.</p>
                        <p>2. It may allow Hanoi to catch its breath, repair damaged communications,
                            and increase its assistance to the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>3. It may appear to the Communist side to be an admission of the
                            ineffectiveness of the bombings and an indication of US desperation for
                            “negotiations now.”</p>
                        <p>4. It will arouse strong criticism among domestic hardliners—particularly
                            among Republicans who are looking for a way to make capital out of any
                            signs of our softness in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>5. It might make a return to air-strikes difficult in the context of

                        <p>4312. Prospects for new <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>1. The new <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> which was launched on June
                            19 has made a fresh start with regard to the organization of political
                            institutions, but it faces the same basic divisions of Vietnamese
                            society which have proved the undoing of four previous governments. This
                            message presents the Mission Council views of the assets and liabilities
                            of the new government as well as its immediate prospects.</p>
                        <p>On the positive side, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> begins its
                            tenure with the following assets:</p>
                        <p>(A) In breaking with past, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has
                            eliminated not only older political institutions, but also the pressure
                            groups which had grown up around them have been cut adrift, at least for
                            the moment. Conspicuous example of this advantage is removal from scene
                            of <persName corresp="#p_PKS1">Phan Khac Suu</persName> and his
                            entourage from a strong position of influence.</p>
                        <p>(B) Military has accepted full responsibility for government although not
                            excluding civilians from sizeable participation. Army represents
                            country's principal base of power, and its engagement in political
                            control and responsibility responds to reality of situation. Despite
                            numerous changes of membership, organization of top Generals—as an
                            entity—has maintained a high degree of unity and has been body of
                            ultimate decision in Vietnam, providing country with its most important
                            single institution of national cohesion since downfall of <persName corresp="#p_Diem1">Diem</persName> regime. At least for the present,
                            top Generals appear to retain this communal unity. Strength which this
                            brings to government will make it somewhat more difficult for opposition
                            groups to successfully attack government.</p>
                        <p>(C) Desire for “revolutionary” government has been widely expressed
                            especially among younger Generals and junior officers, bureaucrats and
                            university youth. The program of action which <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has announced should initially elicit support from such
                            individuals and groups. Whether this support is retained will depend
                            upon performance.<pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0056"/> As noted in
                                <gloss target="#t_SEPTEL1">septel</gloss>,<note n="2" xml:id="d9fn2">Presumably a reference to telegram 4311 from Saigon, June 21, in
                                which <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> analyzed the
                                government's new 26-point program. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27 VIET <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</note>
                            however, program of action strikes at interests of many powerful special
                            groups, majority of whom will not view happily the prospect of being
                            organized for greater service.</p>
                        <p>(D) Cabinet is composed for most part of competent technicians, for the
                            most part young, and in many cases dynamic. For example, the economic
                            wing is in our judgment the most capable, experienced and highly
                            motivated group to have served since November 1963 coup. Southerners are
                            more widely represented in this cabinet than they were in the Huong and
                            Quat governments, which may relieve some of sudiste sense of
                            grievance.</p>
                        <p>(E) Apostolic Delegate Palmas appears ready to play more active role in
                            working to prevent Catholic involvement in civil disorders. This could
                            make major contribution to easing political life for new government.</p>
                        <p>(F) The new government has indicated its intention to act strongly and
                            this no-nonsense attitude may also smooth its political way. If fears of
                            military dictatorship do not rise above threshold point, reluctance of
                            discontented individuals and groups to tangle with determined military
                            leadership will be factor working to dissuade public disturbances.</p>
                        <p>3. On negative side, government starts with following liabilities:</p>
                        <p>(A) A potential opposition grouping lies in the recent temporary alliance
                            of Catholics with southern regionalists. This coalition might tend to
                            regard present <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> as being in a sense
                                <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>'s spiritual heirs. One
                            of major roots of Catholic enmity towards Quat had been belief that he
                            was in league with leaders of central faction of <gloss target="#t_UBA1">UBA</gloss> (Tri Quang-Thien Minh) and was consolidating his power
                            through backing of coalition of Generals and police officials whose
                            hostility towards Catholics they believed was clear. If it now appears
                            to them that after <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>'s
                            removal, coalition behind him has moved to forefront of government,
                            their discontent will continue. Some priests have in fact already made
                            this interpretation. As yet, however, there are points that remain
                            unclear about the new <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, such for
                            example as the precise position and conduct of Police Director Pham Van
                            Lieu, whom Catholics regarded as important member of <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> coalition and whom they regarded as especially
                            hostile to themselves. Furthermore, more active role by Apostolic
                            Delegate as well as reluctance of such leaders as Father Hoang Quynh to
                            see his people engage in confrontation with army itself are important
                            moderating factors. Nevertheless, state of feeling against <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> personally and against new military
                            government in general is high amongst Catholic extremists at this
                            point.</p>
                        <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25" facs="0057"/>
                        <p>Attitude of sudistes not yet so clear. They are more prominently
                            represented in present government than they were under <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>, including such key posts as
                            Defense and Interior. This may remove some of edge from their feeling,
                            although many will undoubtedly continue to resent large number of
                            “carpetbaggers” who remain in positions of great power over them.
                            However, still true that sudistes remain poorly organized and lack means
                            (such as <persName corresp="#p_PKS1">Phan Khac Suu</persName> as Chief
                            of State) for bringing pressures to focus, although many of
                            “politicians” among them would of course serve to swell ranks of
                            opposition, if leadership were provided from somewhere else (for
                            example, by Catholics). Furthermore political scene is clouded by extent
                            to which Saigon intellectuals continue to enjoy conspicuous—and
                            unmerited—influence. For these men as class, opposition politics is
                            traditional—unless they should happen to find selves on inside of
                            government—and political intrigue and maneuver are more important to
                            them than war.</p>
                        <p>To existing nucleus of opposition, new <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> may add other key groups if it presses its program of
                            action vigorously. Such groups might include businessmen, some students
                            and other youth, the wealthy, and possibly higher-level civil servants
                            (see <gloss target="#t_SEPTEL1">septel</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>(B) Organization of government especially at echelon involving senior
                            Generals may well bog down in a structure of interlocking committees
                            resulting in a diffusion of authority and responsibility.</p>
                        <p>(C) If attempt is made to press 26-point program of action vigorously,
                            not only will key groups be alienated, but there is real danger of
                            serious administrative and economic dislocations. There is a finite
                            limit on the number of programs which can be implemented
                            simultaneously.</p>
                        <p>(D) Although they have possessed the ultimate power of decision in
                            Vietnam since downfall of Diem regime, senior military men have not
                            proven their capacity to govern more effectively than civilians. In
                            facing immediate problems of country, skill and finesse in governing
                            will be at premium.</p>
                        <p>(E) Abilities of Nguyen Cao Ky at this juncture are in question. He has
                            created image of brash, courageous young officer, who has led squadrons
                            on attack missions and who was apparently willing to employ air force
                            against city of Saigon if necessary to break coup attempts. He will have
                            difficult task in changing this image, which he will have to do if he is
                            to acquire stature which Vietnamese people as whole will desire to see
                            in their national leader. He clearly lacks experience in art of
                            government, and until now has had no opportunity to demonstrate whether
                            or not he possesses the qualities needed to make a good Prime Minister.
                            His rise in the military does suggest that he possesses decisiveness and
                            leadership abilities, both of which qualities are among the
                            pre-requisites for being an effective PM. However, he was considered by
                            his principal <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> advisor as a poor
                            administrator. Furthermore, it <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26" facs="0058"/>should be noted that <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>'s role,
                            while obviously very important can still be overstated since it appears
                            likely that Generals will continue to watch and moderate his actions as
                            needed. This control may safeguard but it also may retard, depending on
                            how it is applied.</p>
                        <p>(F) By very fact of engaging itself so directly in responsibility of
                            government, club of top Generals adds to divisive pressures playing upon
                            it. As noted earlier, unity of this group as an entity has been a major
                            factor in preserving unity of nation. Adding another element to
                            centrifugal forces at work, is fact that grouping of central Buddhists
                            has begun to zero in on General <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName>
                            as well as <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Thien Minh</persName> apparently
                            intend to hold their fire, at least temporarily, probably because they
                            do not wish to add to problems of government with which they are in
                            sympathy. However, if things should go badly for <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> government, there is excellent chance
                            that they would flex their muscles in center to make clear that they
                            remain force to be reckoned with.</p>
                        <p>(G) In addition to whole range of other problems, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> must at same time face major military threat
                            represented by <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> monsoon offensive,
                            perhaps supported by <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> elements.</p>
                        <p>4. Prospects for new <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. The range of
                            problems confronting this government are formidable in number as well as
                            in depth and complexity. Most important single factor in its success or
                            failure will be degree of administrative and political skill which new
                            government brings to bear in managing these problems. It is as yet too
                            early to assess this element.</p>
                        <p>The problems themselves are formidable. Opposition to previous
                            governments has often been based less on what these governments have
                            actually done than on fears (usually ill-founded) of religious and
                            regional groupings as to what that government might do in future. These
                            basic religious and regional antagonisms and divisions remain unchanged
                            and constitute facts of life for this <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> as for any other. At present, as noted in foregoing,
                            this government starts with Catholics predisposed against, <gloss target="#t_UBA1">UBA</gloss> in favor (though opposed to <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName>); Sudistes probably against
                            anything but pure Sudiste government, Centristes (following <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName>) in favor; Saigon politicians
                            against (as they are against any government that excludes them from
                            power). Because there are numerous uncertainties to present situation,
                            there will probably be at least some period of time during which a
                            wait-and-see attitude is adopted and during which certain of these
                            predispositions may be hardened or possibly modified. If prosecution of
                            war proceeds vigorously and effectively, this would mollify Catholic
                            attitude, and would impress Buddhists also.</p>
                        <p>Nonetheless, despite the inherent hazards that confront all governments
                            in South Vietnam, and the strengths and weaknesses of this particular
                            government, both of which have just been enumerated above, the present
                            government is likely to be as good as can be reasonably expected <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0059"/>at this juncture. At a time of
                            increasing Viet Cong pressures, it also appears probable to us that the
                            Generals are less likely than any purely civilian government to panic
                            and abandon the war effort in favor of negotiations and neutralism.
                            Accordingly, it will serve our best interests to strengthen, support and
                            endorse this government.</p>

                        <p rend="center">MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT ON<lb/>UNITED STATES POLICIES
                            IN VIETNAM</p>
                        <p>1. United States policies toward Vietnam should encompass at least the
                            following essentials:</p>
                        <p>(a) They should command widespread support and respect throughout the
                            world and throughout the United States. This is not presently the
                            case.</p>
                        <p>(b) They must contemplate the cost of “victory” as well as defeat. The
                            cost is already high and we have no sign of victory.</p>
                        <p>(c) The United States will make a profound error if we do no more than
                            prosecute the war. The longer it continues, the more likely it will
                            escalate, and we cannot escalate it ourselves without China and Russia
                            escalating their participation, too.</p>
                        <p>It would be a very serious mistake to think the American people would
                            support a stalemated ground war in Vietnam for a period long enough to
                            force the Communists into negotiating. They refused to support that kind
                            of war in Korea. It became a choice between going all out to win, or
                            ending it on almost any terms.</p>
                        <p>We alone cannot stop the war in Vietnam. But the United Nations could.
                            The United States has more to gain from a U.N.-imposed peace than from a
                            continuation of the fighting, leading we know not where.</p>
                        <p>It is frequently alleged that the United States has three possible
                            courses of action in Vietnam: to escalate, to get out, or to stalemate
                            the issue until the other side gets tired.</p>
                        <p>But there is another course of action which is positive in a world
                            framework, even if the short range effects in Vietnam may be difficult,
                            embarrassing, and involve loss of face. This course is for the United
                            States to call on the United Nations to make the Vietnamese war its
                            business. More is involved than suggesting that the Secretary General
                            visit Hanoi and Peking. What is required is a specific application of
                            U.N. procedures.</p>
                        <p>2. If we have a desire and determination to use the United Nations as
                            prescribed in the Charter, there are many ways in which it can be done.
                            If we desire only to make a gesture to the U.N., there are many ways in
                            which we can make sure our gesture is rejected.</p>
                        <p>On the record, our unilateral action has served to spread both the war
                            and the degree of Communist control in South Vietnam. It is a real <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0061"/>question whether the United
                            Nations could do more poorly than we have done, if it is our objective
                            to keep the peace and to forestall Communism.</p>
                        <p>3. Because North Vietnam—a non-member of the U.N.—said U.N. action was
                            “inappropriate” in no way affects the jurisdiction of the Security
                            Council or the General Assembly over any situation that threatens the
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>To give a veto to North Vietnam over this matter is a travesty on the
                            power of the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>Those of us who were here when President Truman rallied the United
                            Nations in 1950 to throw back aggression in Korea remember that even the
                            opposition of the Soviet Union did not stop us. She walked out of the
                            Security Council and in her absence it took up the breach of the peace
                            in Korea. When Russia came back and used her veto on the implementation
                            of the decision to intervene, the issue was taken to the General
                            Assembly, and it acted.</p>
                        <p>North Korea was not invited to take part in the discussions, and she did
                            not ask to take part; that did not deter the U.N. from acting. Like
                            North Vietnam, North Korea was not a U.N. member.</p>
                        <p>North Vietnam, mainland China, and South Vietnam are not members of the
                            United Nations. None should be accorded a veto over prospective United
                            Nations action in Southeast Asia, either by declining to take part in
                            its discussions or by opposing what is proposed.</p>
                        <p>4. We could request the Vietcong to join us, South Vietnam, and possibly
                            North Vietnam in negotiations. The use of acceptable mediators and
                            conciliators could be discussed.</p>
                        <p>The terms of the Charter provide certain steps to be taken when breaches
                            of the peace occur. The first is Article 33:</p>
                        <p>“1. The parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to
                            endanger the maintenance of international peace and security shall,
                            first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation,
                            conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional
                            agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own
                            choice.</p>
                        <p>“2. The Security Council shall, when it deems necessary, call upon the
                            parties to settle their dispute by such means.”</p>
                        <p>Our offers to negotiate with North Vietnam and with China have not been
                            accepted. However, the Vietcong is a principal party to the dispute in
                            South Vietnam, and until we offer to negotiate with them or undertake
                            with them any of the other means of settlement above, we have not really
                            explored the possibilities of this Article. Moreover, China could be
                            left out of arrangements under this Article since she is not a party to
                            the dispute.</p>
                        <p>5. Article 34 describes the jurisdiction of the Security Council:</p>
                        <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0062"/>
                        <p>“The Security Council may investigate any dispute, or any situation which
                            might lead to international friction or give rise to a dispute, in order
                            to determine whether the continuance of the dispute or situation is
                            likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and
                            security.”</p>
                        <p>Obviously, the war in Vietnam qualifies for at least “investigation” by
                            the Security Council.</p>
                        <p>Article 35 continues:</p>
                        <p>“1. Any member of the United Nations may bring any dispute, or any
                            situation of the nature referred to in Article 34, to the attention of
                            the Security Council or of the General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>“2. A state which is not a Member of the United Nations may bring to the
                            attention of the General Assembly any dispute to which it is a party if
                            it accepts in advance, for the purposes of the dispute, the obligations
                            to pacific settlement provided in the present Charter.</p>
                        <p>“3. The proceedings of the General Assembly in respect of matters brought
                            to its attention under this Article will be subject to the provisions of
                            Articles 11 and 12.”</p>
                        <p>There is a considerable movement afoot among members of the British Labor
                            Party to induce the British Government to act under this Article to put
                            the Vietnam war before the Security Council. Article 99 of the Charter
                            also empowers the Secretary General to bring before the Security Council
                            a dispute he regards as a potential threat to peace. Since members,
                            non-members, and the Secretary General all have the right to do it, the
                            United States would be in the best position if it acts to seek U.N.
                            jurisdiction before someone else does it and, in effect, makes the
                            United States a defendant in the matter.</p>
                        <p>6. If we fail to get discussions, we should invite the Vietcong, North
                            and South Vietnam to join us in laying the dispute before the Security
                            Council.</p>
                        <p>Article 37 is a clear statement of American obligation if we fail to
                            settle the Vietnam problem by peaceful means of our own choosing:</p>
                        <p>“1. Should the parties to a dispute of the nature referred to in Article
                            33 fail to settle it by the means indicated in that Article, they shall
                            refer it to the Security Council.</p>
                        <p>“2. If the Security Council deems that the continuance of the dispute in
                            fact is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and
                            security it shall decide whether to take action under Article 36 or to
                            recommend such terms of settlement as it may consider appropriate.”</p>
                        <p>Very likely the Vietcong and North Vietnam will never join us in
                            referring the war to the Security Council. But they are not U.N.
                            members, and we are. They do not claim to stand for the rule of law in
                            the world, and we do. They could not muster anything like the support in
                            the U.N. that we could.</p>
                        <p>Like North Korea, they probably would not appear at all. But it is their
                            objective to take control of territory they do not now control; and it
                                <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0063"/>is our objective to keep them
                            out. A peace-keeping mission of the U.N. could very likely do more to
                            achieve our stated objective than we are doing.</p>
                        <p>7. Public notice should next be served that we intend to lay the Vietnam
                            war before the Security Council under Articles 35 and 37. Then we should
                            engage in some realistic private talks with the Russians over what kind
                            of U.N. action they would support, making it clear that if we fail to
                            get Security Council action, we will go to the General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>8. As with many legislative matters, this is one of whether we want “an
                            issue or a bill.” If we want a “bill,” in the form of U.N. action, we
                            would have to deal with the other powerful U.N. members—chiefly Russia
                            and France—to work out a United Nations program which they at least
                            would not veto. After all, the Soviet Union did not veto the Cyprus
                            peace force.</p>
                        <p>And there is every reason to think Russia is anxious to see the Vietnam
                            war brought under control so she will not continue being forced to come
                            to the support of a sister Communist state. It is worth a great deal to
                            us to find out whether Russia is interested in a U.N. jurisdiction over
                            the war in the form of a peace mission that would stop it, or more
                            interested in her rivalry with China over who does more to aid wars of
                            liberation.</p>
                        <p>Some say that bringing it up in the U.N. would force Russia to take
                            China's part and drive them closer together. That is an excuse, not a
                            reason. The longer the war continues, the more involved Russia must
                            become simply because of her rivalry with China.</p>
                        <p>9. If we do find that Russia prefers the war to continue, or if France or
                            Nationalist China poses some insurmountable obstacle, we can still go to
                            the General Assembly. We have done it before, both with Korea and the
                            Congo.</p>
                        <p>10. There is nothing in such a policy that would be inconsistent with our
                            commitment of support to South Vietnam. Article 51 of the Charter
                            affirms the right of individual or collective self-defense—</p>
                        <p>“until the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to maintain
                            international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the
                            exercise of this right of self-defense shall be immediately reported to
                            the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and
                            responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take
                            at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or
                            restore international peace and security.”</p>
                        <p>We can help South Vietnam until the U.N. acts to restore peace. Moreover,
                            our 1954 commitment was from an American president to a South Vietnamese
                            president. It is not a treaty; but the American commitment to the U.N.
                            Charter is a treaty.</p>
                        <p>Our commitment to South Vietnam called for U.S. aid, meaning foreign aid,
                            and we extended it “provided your government is prepared to <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0064"/>give assurances as to the standards of
                            performance it would be able to maintain in the event such aid were
                            supplied.”</p>
                        <p>The Government of South Vietnam was unable to fulfill its obligations.
                            Yet we went infinitely beyond our obligation, into co-belligerency. By
                            so doing, we have become involved in a situation that brings us under
                            those provisions of the United Nations Charter to which I have
                            referred.</p>

                        <p>“I stand here today to rededicate the United States of America to the
                            principles and purposes of the United Nations. I propose to do this not
                            by word, but by deed.</p>
                        <p>“Today there rages in Indochina an undeclared war. Some call it a civil
                            war. Others call it a war of aggression. Others call it a war of
                            liberation.</p>
                        <p>“I care not what it is called. It is war. It can spread and destroy all
                            man has built. Men and women and children are dying. Passions are
                            rising, uncontrolled.</p>
                        <p>“The United States is involved in this war. Let there be no mistake, the
                            United States can win it. We believe great and fundamental issues are
                            involved that may affect the future of mankind and the direction in
                            which he grows. We believe that the independence of all small states is
                            involved in Vietnam.</p>

                        <p>“I am, therefore, calling on the Security Council of the United Nations
                            (Articles 34, 35 and 37) to vest itself of the situation in Vietnam as a
                            ‘dispute or situation … likely to endanger the maintenance of
                            international peace and security …’</p>
                        <p>“I also take this occasion to state that my government will abide by such
                            decision as may be taken by the Security Council. I go further and say
                            that if the Security Council should not be able to resolve the war in
                            Vietnam, my government will call for a Special Session of the General
                            Assembly of the United Nations and place the situation before that body
                            of world conscience. We will abide by its recommendations.</p>

                            period of one month while the United Nations considers the threat to the

                            David and they had talked about it at lunch today. The Pres agrees in
                            substance with most of the memo—one or two slight changes possibly.</p>
                        <p>Following are notes taken by <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Moyers</persName> as stated by the Pres: “I don't think I should go
                            over 100,000 but think I should go to that number and explain it. I want
                            George to work for the next 90 days—to work up what is going to happen
                            after the monsoon season. I am not worried about riding off in the wrong
                            direction. I agree that it might build-up bit by bit. I told <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> that I would not make a
                            decision on this and not to assume that I am willing to go overboard on
                            this—I ain't. If there is no alternative, the fellow here with the

                            government is now in office following the promulgation of a new charter

                            can be established, the sovereignty of Viet-Nam is temporarily vested in
                            its armed forces. On the same day, General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> announced his Cabinet and an ambitious and
                            “revolutionary” 26-point program of action.<note n="3" xml:id="d12fn3">The Embassy analyzed the new 26-point program in telegram 4311 from

                        </p>
                        <p>On the whole, the new Cabinet seems a very good one by Vietnamese
                            standards and potentiality. There are seven holdovers from <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>'s team and a better regional
                            balance of Ministers than <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>
                            had, particularly in relation to the number of southerners. There is no
                            particular religious complexion to the Cabinet which is outstanding for
                            its number of young, competent technicians, many of whom in the past
                            have hesitated to serve in a Cabinet. The main question mark remains
                            General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> himself, who thus far
                            has been very cooperative and approachable in the limited dealings which
                            I have had with him in the past few days. He has a rather disarming way
                            of alluding to his inexperience and need for assistance in an unfamiliar
                            role.</p>
                        <p>The chief danger appears to be that of trying to go too far and too fast
                            with an extreme reform program. While <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>'s motives are of the best, the program of action
                            which he has outlined could easily generate heavy opposition if he goes
                            about it in a heavy-handed manner. I am afraid that he is likely to
                            ignore the administrative weakness of his government and clog the
                            machinery by injecting too many projects at one time.</p>
                        <p>The charter which has been promulgated is an imperfect, hastily written
                            document obviously designed to keep <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> under the control of his military peers. There is
                            nothing of importance which he can do as Prime Minister without the
                            approval of the directory of ten officers (of which he is a member)
                            presided over by General <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName>.
                            It looks as if this new government will be far more of an oligarchy than
                            an autocracy.</p>
                        <p>The intensity of military operations dropped off very considerably from
                            the high level of previous weeks. There are a number of factors <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0067"/>which could explain this decline.
                            Several of the Viet Cong regiments have suffered heavy losses and are
                            probably licking their wounds while others, not yet committed, are
                            probably awaiting the word to pass to the offensive. On the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> side, the losses of preceding weeks
                            have caused commanders to prefer to stay on the defensive rather than
                            initiate engagements which may cause additional losses. Little progress
                            has been made in restoring the combat edge of the four regiments and
                            nine battalions (roughly two division equivalents) which I mentioned in
                            my last week's message<note n="4" xml:id="d12fn4">
                                <ref target="#d5">Document 5</ref>.</note> as being ineffective from
                            lack of strength.</p>
                        <p>The use of B-52s of the Strategic Air Command from Guam in a bombing
                            operation on a Viet Cong base 35 miles northwest of Saigon has aroused
                            much interest and considerable discussion of the effectiveness of zonal
                            bombing. Inevitably the effectiveness of such bombing depends upon the
                            accuracy of intelligence, and good intelligence of conditions deep
                            within a Viet Cong war zone is hard to come by. In this case, while the
                            bombs themselves did little damage, they fell close enough to Viet Cong
                            installations to shake their occupants and to facilitate the penetration
                            of ground patrols which accomplished some damage. In future operations
                            of this sort, I would hope that the exploitation by ground forces could
                            be on a scale large enough to guarantee the destruction of Viet Cong
                            personnel and installations which have escaped the effects of the
                            bombing.</p>
                        <p>We have been watching with interest the development of the Commonwealth
                                proposal<note n="5" xml:id="d12fn5">See <ref target="#d6">Document
                                    6</ref>.</note> for finding ways and means of settling the
                            situation here. I have been somewhat concerned over the readiness of our
                            friends to talk of a cease-fire in connection with these activities. A
                            cease-fire under the conditions existing here would be a very tricky
                            affair requiring very careful definition to avoid the many possible
                            pitfalls. We are sending a cable shortly on this subject which I hope
                            will be called to your attention.<note n="6" xml:id="d12fn6">Not further

                            <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> 2331-65. 1. I urgently need your
                            personal views for upcoming discussions of courses of action available
                            to us in Vietnam. The problem can be phrased as follows. What additional
                            military actions can we take in South Vietnam and in the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, short of destroying North Vietnamese
                            economic and population targets, which will apply additional pressures
                            on the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>?</p>
                        <p>2. Please note the word “additional” because it is key to the problem I
                            must address. In other words, I require your assessment of need for
                            additional U.S. forces, their locations and missions, and an assessment
                            of what they could accomplish in South Vietnam. As to actions against
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, I require your views as to
                            targets, modes of delivery (B-52's as opposed to fighter bombers) and
                            collateral actions such as mining Haiphong harbor.</p>
                        <p>3. The subject is regarded here as one of great sensitivity; therefore, I
                            solicit your personal views and not a staff study. In particular, no one
                            other than U.S. military should be consulted or apprised of my
                            request.</p>
                        <p>4. As additional background you should know that thought here in some
                            areas is to the effect that introduction of U.S. troop units over 10,000
                            (some 20,000 fewer than already requested) will convert the war into a
                            second Vietnamese/French war in which we would play the role of the
                            French. That is, Communist propaganda and the inherent xenophobic
                            tendencies of the Vietnamese would surely convert the VNAF and loyal
                            South Vietnamese into our enemies rather than the fact that the <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> leaders have their necks on the
                            chopping block. In sum, regardless of what happens the United States
                            will survive; South Vietnam and its leaders will not. However, I would
                            like your assessment of this point.</p>
                        <p>5. As stated earlier I need your views urgently. In the interest of speed
                            you may have to omit rationale, but provide me as much as you can.<note n="2" xml:id="d13fn2">For <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>'s response, see <ref target="#d17">Document 17</ref>.</note> Regards.</p>

                        <p>Bob McNamara will have a chart and I think he and Dean Rusk will have an
                            agreed position. You probably will not wish to discuss targets in
                            detail, even with such a select group as this. Bob needs one good solid
                            target, and I think he will have settled it with Dean before you come
                            in. He already has my proxy.</p>
                        <p>2. Saigon's Breach of Relations with France</p>
                        <p>The new military government has apparently decided to break relations
                            with Paris. We all think this is a mistake because of the French power
                            of retaliation. There remains a slight difference of opinion as to
                            whether we should say out loud it is a mistake. You will want to hear
                            Rusk on this point.</p>
                        <p>3. Future Use of B-52s</p>
                        <p>Bob McNamara wants to go right on with the B-52s, and in principle, most
                            of us agree. The real problem is not in the military decision but in the
                            public relations handling. I have asked Doug Cater to study this one and
                            he may have ideas.</p>
                        <p>4. Soviet Attitudes and What We Should Do About Them</p>
                        <p>This is not an action matter, but I think it would be helpful for us all
                            to hear Tommy Thompson's current thinking. The Soviets have just turned
                            down the Wilson Peace Mission and in rather tough language. At the same
                            time they are floating the notions that Tony Lewis picked up in the
                            Times this morning—even hinting that we can do anything we want as long
                            as we do it in South Vietnam. It is worth a moment's discussion.</p>
                        <p>5. Prospects of Prime Minister Wilson's Mission</p>
                        <p>My brother <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName> will have the
                            latest on this one. We expect the British to move right ahead even
                            though no Communists give them the time of day.</p>
                        <p>6. Political Progress of the <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>
                            Government</p>
                        <p>I have put this one in to keep everybody's attention focussed on the fact
                            that our problem is indeed as much political as military. My brother
                            will be ready to comment.</p>

                        <p>2. That part of the meeting devoted to Vietnam was opened by Mr. Bundy
                            who presented to the President a copy of the Javits resolution, herewith
                                attached.<note n="4" xml:id="d15fn4">Not printed. </note> The
                            President directed that it be permitted to run its normal course in the
                            Congress.</p>
                        <p>3. Rolling Thunder 20 was approved, Target 43 being chosen instead of
                            51.12/82.15.</p>
                        <p>4. Regarding the anticipated South Vietnamese break in diplomatic
                            relations with France, it was agreed that the United States would tell
                            the French Government that we regretted this section on the part of
                            General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> and that we were not
                            party to the basic decision.</p>
                        <p>5. There ensued considerable discussion of the B-52 strike which is
                            scheduled for Sunday, 27 June. The President emphasized that the press
                            releases on this strike should be handled in such a way as to convey the
                            straight story to the public. He authorized briefing the press fully
                            both in Washington and Saigon on the reasons for such raids and agreed
                            that on this occasion the news of a raid should first be released in
                            Saigon. There was general agreement that there should be a significant
                            tightening up of security on the planning and execution of such
                            raids.</p>
                        <p>6. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> briefed on
                            Soviet attitudes toward Vietnam and emphasized that these attitudes were
                            hardening not only toward the United States but also toward Communist
                            China.</p>
                        <p>7. There was some discussion of a proposal to place an international
                            force across the 17th parallel in order to put an end to North
                            Vietnamese infiltration of South Vietnam. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> indicated<pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0072"/> that such a proposal was unrealistic
                            and could not be implemented without a vast military force. He pointed
                            out that sea patrols of the Vietnamese coast were not turning up
                            significant amounts of equipment proceeding by sea.</p>
                        <p>8. The President expressed considerable concern about the Wilson mission
                            and said that he saw no point in having the Prime Minister come to
                            Washington if Washington and Saigon were the only capitals which would
                            receive him. He expressed the view that a Wilson visit could be
                            counterproductive, would achieve little in the interest of peace, and
                            might turn out to be a further embarrassment to the United States
                            foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>9. The remainder of the discussion on Vietnam is excluded from this
                            Memorandum for the Record since the President made it clear he did not
                            want it talked about outside the compass of the meeting.</p>

                        <p>On June 23, 1965, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> met in the White House at 5:50 p.m. with his
                            senior advisers to discuss Vietnam. See <ref target="#d15">Document
                                15</ref> for a record of the discussion during the first part of the
                            meeting. According to <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William
                                Bundy</persName>'s recollections, based on notes he took at the
                            meeting, the discussion then turned to the question of the policy
                            alternatives that would be open to the administration at the end of the
                            summer. The general feeling, Bundy recorded, was that more forces would
                            be needed. “<persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alexis Johnson</persName>, back
                            from Saigon on consultation, was skeptical: 15 American battalions was a
                            good level-off point, and we must accept that this would be a long war,
                            without shortcuts and with only the grinding proof to the Viet Cong that
                            they could not win. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> at once
                            chimed in, giving the gist of his argument that we should stop at
                            100,000 and then think hard—even about plans for cutting our losses and
                            shifting our focus of action in Southeast Asia to Thailand. Rusk and
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0073"/>objected to the last idea:
                            Thailand, they thought, could not be held if <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> had given up. Rather, Rusk said, we would end up with
                            the only secure areas Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, and
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, with even India falling to
                            the Communist Chinese. It was an extreme statement, and my notes show an
                            exclamation point in the margin—and a note to myself to get an estimate
                            of the consequences of withdrawal from <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>“After this exchange, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            moved in the opposite direction from <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>. His proposal was a combination of a lot more
                            force, in the South and possibly selectively in the North as well, and a
                            much more intensive negotiating effort than he felt had yet been made.
                            At least, he said, let us show the President what might be done on these
                            two lines, coordinated with each other. He had the ideas on additional
                            forces, and Ball had the ideas on moves toward a settlement; perhaps the
                            two meshed with each other, and were less contradictory than some might
                            suppose.</p>
                        <p>“The result was at least agreement on the next steps. The President, who
                            had for the most part let the discussion rage around him without
                            injecting his own views, directed <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, with one or two staff men each, to produce studies
                            covering military and political moves over the next three months and
                            beyond. These were to come back in a week, although there was of course
                            no assurance that the issue would then be decided.” (Johnson Library,

                        <p>1. Per your request in reference I have following views. Some items are
                            based on studies; others are not.</p>
                        <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0074"/>
                        <p>2. By way of introduction, the premise behind whatever further actions we
                            may undertake, either in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, must be that we are in for the long
                            pull. The struggle has become a war of attrition. Short of decision to
                            introduce nuclear weapons against sources and channels of enemy power, I
                            see no likelihood of achieving a quick, favorable end to the war. The
                            fabric of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> civil functions and
                            services has been rendered so ineffective and listless by successive
                            coups and changes, and the military arm is in such need of
                            revitalization that we can come to no other conclusion. In this context
                            the following is submitted for your consideration.</p>
                        <p>3. I am becoming more convinced every day that US forces in appropriate
                            numbers must be deployed to permit the Vietnamese with our help to carry
                            the war to the enemy. Objectives would be to neutralize enemy power,
                            give heart to the war weary <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> and
                            provide adequate maneuverable fire power to attack the enemy formations
                            wherever they can be found and fixed. With regard to your comment that
                            some in Washington consider that more than a 10,000 man US combat force
                            will invoke visions of the French, I can only comment that force of that
                            number will not give us a chance of winning or assure avoidance of
                            defeat. Although the hazard exists, there is absolutely no logical
                            reason to conclude that we will be cast in the role of the French. It's
                            up to the US leadership in SVN to insure that we do not fall into such a
                            role, by means of indoctrination, discipline, morale, positioning the
                            masses of US combat forces away from population centers and
                            administrative controls, all of which we now stress. I am confident that
                            this one is manageable.</p>
                        <p>4. As a refinement and supplement to the forces which may be required as
                            set forth in paragraph 10B, Ref B, I believe the following will also be
                            required, sooner or later.</p>
                        <p>A. A minimum of 7 more army helicopter companies than presently deployed
                            or approved, and two more USMC helo squadrons in I Corps. Ratio is 2
                            companies (sqdns) per separate US brigade, 1 company per 3d country
                            brigade.</p>
                        <p>B. The 101st Abn Div Brigade and 173d Abn Brigade retained in country and
                            both positioned in Bien Hoa area under a task force HQ to provide the
                            heavy mobile punch to gain the initiative.</p>
                        <p>C. Possibly at least another US infantry or airborne division to provide
                            an offensive punch and get <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> troops
                            in the III Corps area on the offensive. <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> order of battle in III Corps area, plus other mobile
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> units nearby, are approaching the
                            potential for sustained if not successful attack on communication
                            centers.</p>
                        <p>5. The foregoing are big orders. However, believe it is time all
                            concerned face up to fact that we must be prepared for a long war which
                            will probably involve increasing numbers of US troops. If the Communists
                            have the determination to make it such, they certainly have the
                            capabilities <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0075"/>and we have no
                            choice but to match them, with an increment left over in our favor.</p>
                        <p>6. Actions which we may take against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> include several which I think will increase pressure on
                            Hanoi and support our effort in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, but
                            which do not involve unacceptable risk of provoking an escalation to the
                            extent of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> involvement.</p>
                        <p>A. Use B-52's on isolated military targets remote from civilian
                            populations. Several ammo and supply depots fit this description. A
                            study could turn up more. B-52's could put massive fire power on such
                            area targets with much more effectiveness and less risk than the
                            equivalent in fighter bombers.</p>
                        <p>B. Interdict the trans Nanning-Hanoi-Kunming Railroad. There are 5 key
                            bridges whose destruction would be devastating. 10 percent of total
                            import tonnages use this railroad to Hanoi; but we suspect the tonnages
                            have a much higher qualitative value.</p>
                        <p>C. Interdict Haiphong Harbor with repetitive mining.</p>
                        <p>D. Accelerate leaflet operations targeted on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> population centers.</p>
                        <p>E. Continue our air interdiction programs of <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>'s. It takes a long time for cumulative results to
                            produce a telling effect on primitive <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> system. This is another aspect of
                            the war of attrition which we must be prepared to prosecute in full
                            measure despite mounting costs.</p>
                        <p>7. To conclude, I will emphasize some general thoughts which seem
                            pertinent.</p>
                        <p>A. It is difficult, if not impossible for me to imagine how we can commit
                            and sustain US forces, air, surface and naval, without backing them up
                            for the long pull by mobilization of manpower, industrial and training
                            resources at least to a limited degree. I face the very practical
                            problem of maintaining morale of people on their second combat tours,
                            with many, many more to come, I suspect, when all the forces we require
                            are committed. I understand almost the entire complement of aviators in
                            the 1st Cav will be on their 2d tour by the time it gets here, while the
                            average US citizen enjoys his butter at no inconvenience.</p>
                        <p>B. It would seem that we should prepare US and world opinion for the
                            rigors ahead by airing an objective, complete analysis of the problem we
                            face and what we must do about it. The news couldn't be worse overall
                            than it is now made out to be in piece-meal fashion by irresponsible or
                            uninformed reporting and editorializing today. This could well be the
                            most salutary thing we might do. The government would then be in a
                            position to counterattack, in good faith, the distorted reporting of the
                            crepe hangers.</p>

                            makes the tightest case I have seen for taking Vietnam to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He recognizes that the Soviet Union
                            might block action in the Security Council, and in that event he would
                            press on into the General Assembly. He would “abide by” a majority vote
                            in the General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>2. What he does not say is what kind of resolution he would press for
                            either in the Security Council or in the General Assembly. It is on this
                            point that I think he should be pressed. Does he want the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to vote ways and means of getting the
                            North Vietnamese out of South Vietnam? Or does he want the General
                            Assembly to validate a Communist takeover? Or does he simply want it to
                            “observe”, as it is doing in the Dominican Republic? The last is about
                            all we could really hope to get, and while it might be worth it, it
                            would certainly not bring peace, in and of itself.</p>
                        <p>3. As you know, I myself think that we can and should take further
                            initiatives to see what the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> can do
                            about Vietnam. I think this is primarily a tactical matter, designed to
                            show that the Soviet Union is not prepared to desert other “socialist”
                            countries on this issue. The trouble with this tactical approach, of
                            course, is that a man who holds <persName corresp="#p_MW1">Morse</persName>'s basic view is likely to denounce it as a fraud
                            unless we take it all the way through and actively work for a resolution
                            which would get us out of there. And if we are going to get out of
                            Vietnam, I do not think it serves any good purpose to blacken the
                            reputation of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> by trying
                            unsuccessfully to unload this responsibility on it. No one would be
                            fooled, and both the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and the US would
                            be damaged.</p>
                        <p>4. So I think the underlying difference between us and <persName corresp="#p_MW1">Morse</persName> is not whether we should take the
                            case to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, but what we take it there
                            for. I would take it there to pin the rose of aggression on the
                            Communists. I think Senator <persName corresp="#p_MW1">Morse</persName>
                            would take it there in order to cover a withdrawal <pb n="45" xml:id="pg_45" facs="0077"/>and a Communist takeover. But I am not
                            sure, and this is what a talk with him may uncover.<note n="3" xml:id="d18fn3">At 12:20 p.m. on June 24, McGeorge Bundy telephoned
                                Secretary Rusk and said that President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> wanted a draft paragraph prepared for the
                                speech he was going to deliver in San Francisco the following day
                                that would indicate the President intended to instruct <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Adlai Stevenson</persName> to take up the
                                question of Vietnam in the U.N. Security Council. Bundy said the
                                President asked him to find out more of what Rusk and <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> thought of raising the
                                issue in the Security Council. Rusk said that he would try to
                                contact <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName>. He added
                                that it might be possible to raise the issue in the context of a
                                general report on the problem “without ginning up too much
                                expectation that the Security Council will be able to act.”

                        <p>The basic arguments against going to the Security Council now are
                            three:</p>
                        <p>a. that it would be unsettling in Saigon. This can be controlled, but not
                            prevented.</p>
                        <p>b. that it would require Moscow to take a harsh public line against us at
                            a time when we still have some hope to engage them more usefully in
                            negotiation.</p>
                        <p>c. there is a danger that Hanoi would read this appeal as weakness.</p>
                        <p>Given these difficulties, I am inclined now to back away from this one. I
                            think it would be wiser to take the position that if there should ever
                                <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0078"/>be a prospect of effective

                            to work for it. Language which might do that sort of thing follows and
                            could be fitted in to the present draft quite easily, I believe.<note n="3" xml:id="d19fn3">In his address to the 20th anniversary

                            executions continue, we should substantially increase weight of Rolling
                            Thunder attacks, probably including oil supplies in Haiphong area. Rusk
                            is less certain.</p>
                        <p>We are considering usefulness of leaflet drops on Hanoi-Haiphong area
                            which would say that if these outrages continue, necessary further
                            action will be taken.</p>

                        <p>From: Embassy Saigon No. 4402<note n="3" xml:id="d20fn3">Dated June 26.
                                (Johnson Library, National Security File, Country File, Vietnam,
                                Vol. XXXVI)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is a US Mission message.</p>
                        <p>Viet Cong execution of Sergeant <persName corresp="#p_RBJ1">Bennett</persName> closely followed by My Canh restaurant atrocity
                            brings into sharp focus blackmail potential <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and Hanoi possess in numbers of US hostages in their
                            hands and the usefulness of this blackmail to support a stepped-up
                            terrorist campaign. Since they well aware we place higher value on human
                            life than do they, Hanoi/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> prepared use
                            this weapon to own advantage. They have evidently decided that execution
                            of US prisoners will be very sensitive issue for <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, and their experience with <persName corresp="#p_HGC1">Hertz</persName> case in which they undoubtedly aware that we have
                            caused <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to delay execution of Hai,
                            may have led them to believe that we will pay very high price to prevent
                            execution of our personnel. They thus hope to cause political problems
                            between US and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, to stir up US public
                            opinion against Viet-Nam policy, to damage US troop morale, and also
                            raise morale their terrorist cadre by showing their ability to retaliate
                            for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> executions and by possibility of
                            delaying or halting further <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            executions. (We understand 5 or 6 convicted <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> terrorists now awaiting carrying out of death
                            sentence.)</p>
                        <p>Text of announcement, which first made over Radio Hanoi, a fact we should
                            emphasize as evidence of origin of this outrage, makes clear that Hanoi
                            and <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are holding <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> responsible for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> action in executing three named terrorists. In our
                            response to this outrage we should make clear we likewise hold Hanoi
                            responsible. Announcement also makes clear that Sergeant <persName corresp="#p_RBJ1">Bennett</persName> was executed on orders of Hanoi
                            cloaked as “orders of the NLFSV Central Committee” by the command of the
                            South Viet-Nam Liberation Front, apparently without any pretext of a
                            trial. Announcement also twice mentions policy of NLFSV toward
                            “prisoners of war” as “humane and lenient” and as “correct and humane”.
                            It mentions prisoners of war in three contexts: executed terrorists are
                            referred to as prisoners of war and are equated with US detainees;
                            “rebel soldiers” (<gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>) are referred
                            to as prisoners of war and in obvious appeal to Vietnamese opinion,
                            offer is made to release those who have “repented”; US detainees are
                            called US “war prisoners” but their lives are said to be dependent on
                            actions of US “aggressors”. This is first use of term “prisoners of war”
                            in any of these three contexts to our knowledge.</p>
                        <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0080"/>
                        <p>We cannot permit ourselves to be placed in position of paying blackmail
                            for lives of US prisoners in form of preventing <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> from executing terrorists who are tried and convicted
                            of violating Vietnamese civil law. If not sternly repressed, terrorism
                            is likely to become a <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> tactic of
                            increasing proportions. Even if we were willing to pay blackmail
                            regardless of difficulties which it would cause internally for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and for our relations with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, we would soon find the price raised to
                            some other even less acceptable level.</p>
                        <p>The US Mission takes the general position that (a) convicted <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> terrorists must be punished in accordance
                            with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> law regardless of possible
                            reprisal actions against US prisoners in <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> hands; (b) must hold Hanoi responsible both for
                            terrorism and for reprisals against our prisoners; and (c) we should
                            obtain maximum propaganda effect in condemning the <persName corresp="#p_RBJ1">Bennett</persName> and My Canh incidents in
                            combination as international murder (the toll of dead so far—27
                            Vietnamese, 13 US, 2 French, 1 Swiss, 1 Filipino; wounded—62 Vietnamese,
                            16 US, 1 Swiss, 2 Germans).</p>
                        <p>We therefore recommend</p>
                        <p>(1) The immediate execution of a bombing attack in the Hanoi-Haiphong
                            area with an appropriate statement of the reason for the departure from
                            the Rolling Thunder pattern. This attack to be accompanied by major
                            leaflet drops in <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> and by maximum
                            exploitation by VOA and other media.</p>
                        <p>(2) A Presidential statement voicing sense of outrage of American people
                            at these wanton acts of murder and announcing that target in preceding
                            paragraph was accordingly being attacked to show <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would not stand for blatant violation of all standards
                            of humanity and international conduct.</p>
                        <p>(3) A <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> statement similarly denouncing
                            the My Canh atrocity and the wanton murder of Sergeant <persName corresp="#p_RBJ1">Bennett</persName>, contrasting latter with due
                            process of law followed in trial of Tran Van Dang, who was caught
                            redhanded preparing to blow up building in city of Saigon, charged,
                            tried by competent court, and convicted under accepted standards of
                            justice.</p>
                        <p>(4) <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> protest to <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>We believe and intend that above steps would lead to heavy public
                            denunciation of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> terrorism and
                            execution of US prisoner. If handled properly this should have opposite
                            effect to that intended by <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> of stirring
                            American public opinion in support of US policy in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>We feel that the publicity campaign should get underway at once and the
                            overall <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> position should be
                            established in the next few hours. We have asked <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to make no statement for time being, but we will have
                            difficulty keeping <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> quiet if matter
                            drags. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said this was a dreadful
                            decision. Bundy said it was not actually a decision—the President wants
                            to hear the arguments. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said
                            we have to recognize the fact that there will be incidents and we are
                            either in a war or we are not—we should work out rational course of
                            action to meet accidental or incidental events. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said we have not been prepared to
                            make a decision to drop bombs on Hanoi-Haiphong up to now and he does
                            not know why we make this decision on this basis. Bundy said he had said
                            all of this and that he would like to have a meeting at 4:30.<note n="3" xml:id="d21fn3">See <ref target="#d22">Document 22</ref>.</note>
                            Bundy said he has called Secretary but has not reached him yet because
                            he is enroute from the office to his home. Bundy said meeting could be
                            held at State Department and they could then give President their
                            recommendations and choice. Bundy said he had to tell <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, however, that the President feels
                            strongly about this. Bundy said he thinks what is on the President's
                            mind is that we did react after Pleiku and here is something bigger.
                            President thinks country will feel strongly about this. Bundy asked
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> if he had seen <gloss target="#t_AP1">AP</gloss> 93, which is direct threat to <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and South Vietnamese
                            leaders—they will be marked for death. Bundy said his personal judgment

                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>, Bill Bundy, and I have just
                            met for an hour to review all aspects of possible reprisal for
                            restaurant and <persName corresp="#p_RBJ1">Bennett</persName>
                            outrages.</p>
                        <p>2. We concluded that if reprisal is ordered, best target is either power
                            plant or <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> depot in Hanoi-Haiphong
                            area. No target outside this area is sufficiently important to be a
                            noticeable departure from present Rolling Thunder pattern.</p>
                        <p>3. In order to strike a target in the Hanoi-Haiphong area with minimum
                            international backlash, we all agree that we must consult major friendly
                            nations. Attack without such consultation could easily drive Wilson and
                            others clear off the reservation, and while they are not as much help to
                            us as they think, we would not look smart if a single act of reprisal
                            gave them an excuse to jump ship.</p>
                        <p>4. This consultation would probably lead to fairly heavy argument against
                            attack in reprisal form. Allies could point out that repeated executions
                            of prisoners by Nazis in World War II were not used to justify specific
                            reprisals. They could point out also that once we moved to measured air
                            operations in North Vietnam after Pleiku we avoided specific acts of
                            reprisals as in the case of the Embassy bombing.</p>
                        <p>5. We believe nevertheless that by a strenuous diplomatic effort we could
                            probably keep most allies with us, although not happy. But one condition
                            of this effort would be that we emphasize military need for attacks on
                            these targets and downgrade reprisal aspect. But if we are to use
                            straight military argument with allies, we should use it with our own
                            people too.</p>
                        <p>6. And that leads to the main argument which seems important to all of
                            us—namely, that major new acts against the north should be undertaken in
                            terms of our whole policy in Vietnam, and not in response to particular

                            hit targets in Hanoi-Haiphong area. We do all agree that this is a major
                            decision which should be made in a wider context than these
                            atrocities.</p>

                            Soviet readiness to work toward serious negotiations. Attack in

                            bound to react with great force to continued atrocities. We can and will
                            make this point to allies as well, so that further outrages of this sort
                            can be used to lay a base for such additional military actions as you

                        <p>The regime in Hanoi and their puppet liberation front in South Viet-Nam
                            have acknowledged their responsibility for the execution of Sgt.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RBJ1">Bennett</persName> and for the bombing
                            of the My Canh restaurant in Saigon, in which 44 persons, Vietnamese,
                            American, French, Swiss, Filipino were killed and many more persons
                            injured. They have compounded their brutal conduct by publicly bragging
                            about their action and making threats to carry out even more outrageous
                            acts. We in America and people around the world cannot help but be
                            appalled and revolted by this show of wanton inhumanity. These Communist
                            threats to intimidate, of course, will not succeed. Our determination to
                            help the embattled people of South Viet-Nam to avoid their falling under
                            a regime which is capable of such brutality will only be

                        <p>Hanoi's recent statements have surely also made it clear to anyone who
                            may have had any doubt that it is the power directing the policies and

                        <p>From Embassy Moscow No. 3863</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                            accompanied by Smirnovsky came to Spaso today for lunch in honor of
                            George Kennan. Stoessel and Toon were only other guests present. I had
                            originally invited Keldysh, MGU Rector Petrovsky and several other
                            historians and academicians but all for various reasons declined. On
                            behalf <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, Foreign Office
                            had initially expressed doubts that Foreign Minister would be able to
                            attend but subsequently called Embassy to advise that after rechecking
                            his calendar <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had found it
                            possible to accept. I suspect that when <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> reached this decision word was passed to other
                            invitees they should decline in order permit Foreign Minister engage in
                            private, frank conversation which in fact took place. Conversation
                            ranged over wide spectrum and throughout <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was affable and gave impression of genuine
                            desire to resume dialogue on basic issues which initiated in post-Cuba
                            period. Following are significant points in exchange relating to Vietnam
                            and U.S.-Sov relations.</p>
                        <p>After general discussion and frank exchange of views with Kennan on
                            national liberation movement thesis—in which Kennan proved to be able
                            and effective advocate our position, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> turned to me and said he wished to convey two
                            basic points. In first place, he said, Soviets are not authorized and
                            cannot negotiate on behalf of North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Vietnamese situation must be discussed with <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. He would point out that so far as Soviet position is
                            concerned, 4-point statement by <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            would be reasonable basis for negotiations. As he had told Secretary
                            Rusk in Vienna, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would
                            caution the U.S. that no progress could be made if any future approach
                            to <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> should be cast in “insulting”
                            terms as it had been previously. For us to announce suspension of
                            hostile action against <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and
                            simultaneously to inform <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> that unless
                            it behaved according to our prescription the punishment would be <pb n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0085"/>resumed was bound to lead us
                            nowhere. Secondly, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                            stressed that it has been and continues to be fundamental Soviet policy
                            to seek improvement in U.S.-Soviet bilateral relations. He was compelled
                            to observe, however, that Soviet Government had been disappointed by
                            drastic change in U.S. policy since elections, and Soviets could not
                            avoid feeling that policy now pursued by President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> in most instances paralleled
                            that endorsed by Goldwater in electoral campaign.</p>
                        <p>I made following comments on <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s remarks. I said U.S. Government fully
                            recognized difficulties faced by Soviet Government in dealing with
                            Vietnamese situation; obviously Soviet maneuverability was restricted by
                            attitude of Hanoi and to certain extent Peking. On other hand we had
                            hoped that Soviet Government would be prepared to bring its influence to
                            bear on Hanoi in effort to bring about peaceful settlement of Vietnamese
                            problem which neither of us, I felt, wished to see escalated to a
                            dangerous degree. Meanwhile, I thought <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> should recognize that current U.S. policy of
                            support for South Vietnam was laid down 10 years ago and had been
                            followed consistently by three administrations. Recently, of course,
                            degree of U.S. support had increased but this had only been in response
                            to step-up in hostile and terroristic activities of forces controlled by
                            North Vietnam rather than change in our basic policy. Equally, there had
                            been no change in U.S. policy with regard to our bilateral relations
                            with Soviet Union. We have consistently taken position that despite
                            current difficulties, particularly in Vietnam, we desire continuing
                            improvement in U.S.-Soviet bilateral relations on which such significant
                            start had been made in 1963. It was our impression from public
                            statements of Soviet leadership and Soviet press comment that it was
                            Soviet attitude that in this respect had undergone a basic change. They
                            had in fact flatly stated both privately to me and then publicly, that
                            U.S. activities in Vietnam were incompatible with continued improvement
                            U.S.-Soviet relations. It was therefore reassuring to me personally to
                            have <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> restate in positive
                            terms his government's position in favor of improvement of U.S.-Soviet
                            bilateral relations. I could assure him that we would do our part toward
                            this end.</p>
                        <p>Comment: It is entirely possible of course that reason for <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s appearance at Spaso was
                            simply to satisfy his curiosity about Kennan whom he had met only
                            briefly shortly after the war to make appropriate official gesture
                            following 1952 persona non grata action, and to attempt to influence
                            views of a prominent representative of American academic community.
                            However, it became obvious that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had come specifically prepared to make to me
                            statement summarized above. It is obvious from this account that
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was not prepared or
                            authorized go much beyond officially stated Sov position, particularly
                            on Vietnam. I had impression, however, particularly from his positive
                            comment on U.S.-Sov relationship (which does, of course, differ from
                            official position), <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0086"/>his affable
                            mood, and his almost wistful recall of 1963 atmosphere that there is
                            perhaps some new flexibility in Sov posture. It seemed to me that he was
                            trying to suggest that Soviet Government finds itself in extremely
                            awkward position, that it genuinely desires to see the heat taken out of
                            Vietnamese situation, that this can be done only by direct approach to
                            Hanoi accompanied by cessation of bombing. He seemed to imply some hope
                            that if this should be done Hanoi's response would be positive and the
                            Sov Gov would then find it possible and desirable to resume the dialogue
                            with U.S. and restore the hopeful relationship which existed in 1963.

                            and cut our losses in Vietnam we should do so because of a finding that
                            the Vietnamese themselves are not meeting their obligations to
                            themselves or to us. This is the course we started on with <persName corresp="#p_Diem1">Diem</persName>, and if we got a wholly
                            ineffective or anti-American government we could do the same thing
                            again. With a “neutralist” government it would be quite possible to move
                            in this direction.</p>

                        <p rend="center">The Nature of Our Legal Commitment</p>
                        <p>1. The Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty, when read together with
                            its protocol, provides that in the event of “aggression by means of
                            armed attack” against South Viet-Nam each party will “act to meet the
                            common danger in accordance with its constitutional processes.”</p>
                        <p>2. The United States has determined<note n="4" xml:id="d24fn4">The
                                determination that North Viet-Nam was committing “aggression by
                                armed attack” was explicitly stated in the so-called “White Paper”
                                entitled “Aggression from the North” issued by the Department of
                                State in February 1965. [Footnote in the source text; see <ref target="frus1964-68v02#d171">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1964-1968, vol. II,
                                    Document 171</ref>.]</note> that there has been such aggression
                            against South Viet-Nam, which has brought this Treaty obligation into
                            operation. Although other <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> powers
                            are providing assistance to South Viet-Nam, the United States, to the
                            best of our knowledge, is the only one that has made this determination.
                            There has been no decision by the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> members to act collectively “to meet the common
                            danger” in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>3. Since South Viet-Nam is not a party to the Southeast Asia Treaty, our
                            obligation under the Treaty does not run directly to South Viet-Nam.
                            Authorities on international law generally agree that only parties (and
                            not “third-party beneficiaries”) acquire rights under a treaty. However,
                            since the United States has determined that there has been “aggression”
                            against South Viet-Nam within the meaning of the Treaty, our assistance
                            to the South Vietnamese Government to meet that aggression is in
                            discharge of our treaty obligation.</p>
                        <p>4. Our provision of military assistance to South Viet-Nam is consistent
                            with the United Nations Charter. Article 51 of the Charter recognizes
                            the inherent right of individual and collective self-defense—although it
                            does not impose an obligation of collective defense on <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Members.</p>
                        <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0088"/>
                        <p>5. In addition to its treaty responsibilities with respect to South
                            Viet-Nam, the United States has repeatedly promised the Government of
                            South Viet-Nam to assist it in its struggle against aggression. These
                            promises have been embodied in a series of messages and statements,
                            beginning in October 1954 when President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> promised to aid “the Government of Viet-Nam
                            in developing and maintaining a strong, viable state, capable of
                            resisting attempted subversion and aggression through military
                                means.”<note n="5" xml:id="d24fn5">See ibid., 1952-1954, vol. XIII,
                                Part 2, p. 2167.</note> The implied—and frequently
                            expressed—conditions to the provision of United States assistance have
                            been (a) the continuing request of the South Vietnamese Government for
                            such assistance and (b) its will and ability to use that assistance
                            effectively.</p>

                        <p rend="center">Consequences of Withdrawal</p>
                        <p>1. The consequences of an abrupt withdrawal of our assistance from South
                            Viet-Nam should be judged not in juridical terms but in terms of its
                            effect on the credibility of our commitments throughout the world. The
                            relevant questions would be:</p>
                        <p>a. To what extent would such withdrawal impair the confidence of other
                            small nations on the periphery of Communist power that the United States
                            had the will and resources to help them prevent a Communist
                            takeover?</p>
                        <p>b. To what extent would such withdrawal shake the faith of our partners
                            in other security treaties—whether in Latin America, Europe, the Far
                            East or elsewhere—that we would and could meet our treaty
                            obligations?</p>
                        <p>c. To what extent would such withdrawal reduce the prestige of the United
                            States and hence diminish its power and effectiveness in its dealings
                            with other governments?</p>
                        <p>2. The answers to these questions would not depend on the differences or
                            similarities in the nature of our legal commitments. Our obligations
                            under the North Atlantic Treaty, for example, are quite different from
                            our responsibilities for Viet-Nam under <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, since we have obligations running directly to each
                            of our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners to take action,
                            including the use of armed force, in the event of an armed attack on any
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> power.</p>
                        <p>Our obligations to West Berlin are covered not only by Articles 5 and 6
                            of the North Atlantic Treaty but by our status as an occupying power
                            pursuant to the unconditional surrender of Germany at the end of World
                            War II.</p>
                        <p>We are obliged directly to the other American republics under the Rio
                            Treaty of 1947 to come to their assistance in the event of armed
                            attack.</p>
                        <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0089"/>
                        <p>3. In the longer term, we must judge a decision to withdraw assistance
                            from South Viet-Nam primarily in terms of its effect on the ability of
                            the United States to maintain its role of world leadership. That role is
                            not an easy one. France could withdraw from Indochina or Algeria without
                            wide-ranging consequences since it was not a great power and other
                            nations did not depend on France for their own security. The United
                            States must, however, always act with the consciousness that if it fails
                            to discharge its role of leadership there is no other free world power
                            capable of taking its place.</p>

                        <p>Vietnamese youth and students remain volatile and restless and are quite
                            capable of making political trouble. To minimize this prospect and to
                            direct their energies along more constructive lines, the Mission has
                            supported a summer youth program designed to place several thousand
                            urban youth into rural areas to participate in small-scale civic action
                            activities. The program has been well received by various political and
                            religious groups. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has initiated a

                        <p>In late April a Montagnard agricultural conference was held at Dalat
                            attended by 100 Montagnard officials and a Saigon delegation. The
                            Minister of Agriculture announced that the Montagnards would be given
                            title to the lands they now farm and be permitted to cut timber from
                            government forests. In May an Office of Ethnic Minority Affairs was
                            established directly subordinate to the Prime Minister to deal with
                            Montagnard and other ethnic minority grievances. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> gave special attention to the Montagnards in expanding

                        <p>You approved an action calling for a revitalization of the
                            Inter-Religious Council, where religious grievances could be aired and
                            adjudicated without resort to political action. Mission contacts with
                            principal religious leaders were expanded and efforts were made to
                            exploit these contacts for the revitalization of the religious council.
                            While the more moderate religious leaders supported this initiative,
                            extreme militants among both Buddhists and Catholics were not
                            forthcoming and the tension between them persists. An initiative with
                            the Holy See in Rome has further encouraged the moderating influence of
                            the Apostolic Delegate in Saigon. The new government is considering the
                            formation of a “National Consultative Council” to include

                        <p rend="center">Summary</p>
                        <p>This paper, written on the premise that we are losing the war in
                            Viet-Nam, advances and supports the following propositions:</p>
                        <p>1. We cannot achieve our political objectives by expanding the bombing of
                            North Viet-Nam. On the contrary, extending the geographical scope of our
                            bombing will pose grave dangers of involving both Red China and the
                            Soviet Union while isolating the United States from its friends and
                            allies.</p>
                        <p>2. There is no assurance that we can achieve our objectives by
                            substantially expanding American forces in South Viet-Nam and committing
                            them to direct combat. On the contrary, we would run grave risks of
                            bogging down an indeterminate number of American troops in a protracted
                            and bloody conflict of uncertain outcome. This risk is so great, in
                            fact, that those who advocate this course must sustain the burden of
                            proof that commitment of American forces to combat will assure our
                            objectives at an acceptable cost.</p>
                        <p>3. Combining expanded air attacks in the North with increased troop
                            commitments in the South will not achieve the desired objective. The
                            whole is not greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
                        <p>4. Since the measures discussed in paragraphs 1 and 2 above offer no
                            assurance that we can win the war by substantially greater US
                            commitments, we should undertake either to extricate ourselves or to
                            reduce our defense perimeters in South Viet-Nam to accord with the
                            capabilities of a limited US deployment.</p>
                        <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0095"/>
                        <p>5. This is our last clear chance to make this decision. If we go forward
                            with Phase III combat, even at the present level of troop deployment, a
                            substantial number of Americans will be killed. This will make it much
                            harder and more costly to extricate ourselves or reduce our commitments.
                            We should, therefore, revise current orders to return to Phase II and we
                            should maintain our present levels of deployment while we seek to get
                            out of the quagmire and cut our losses.</p>
                        <p>6. By pursuing a systematic and careful plan for cutting our losses we
                            should be able to create the conditions under which we can get out of a
                            dangerous situation without excessive loss of American prestige and
                            influence.</p>
                        <p rend="center">How To Think About the Problem</p>
                        <p>To determine a proper course of action we must balance the risks and
                            costs of a war fought by United States forces against the risks and
                            costs of a carefully organized tactical withdrawal of the United States
                            from South Viet-Nam or a systematic reduction of our territorial
                            commitment to accord with the capabilities of a limited US
                            deployment.</p>
                        <p>Obviously, if a curtailment of our commitment in South Viet-Nam would
                            place the United States in imminent peril, we would be justified in
                            taking long chances in pouring troops and equipment into that

                        <p>On the other hand, if we could accomplish such curtailment in a manner
                            that would minimize the costs and dangers to the United States, the
                            indicated formula would be quite different.</p>
                        <p>The ultimate decision, therefore, involves a hard-nosed judgment as to
                            the relative costs and dangers to America—both short-term and
                            long-term—of these two courses of action.</p>

                        <p>Against the background of these propositions, we propose a plan that
                            should either create the conditions for a systematic US extrication

                        <p>(a) that there is a government genuinely representing the people of South
                            Viet-Nam which continues to ask for our support; and</p>
                        <p>(b) that such government maintains an adequate standard of performance,
                            both in the conduct of the war and the making of necessary political,
                            economic and social reforms.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Step 3</p>
                        <p>1. Since Americans are dying in South Viet-Nam, the United States has
                            both the right and duty to demand of Saigon that it fashion a stable
                            Government of National Union. We should, therefore, make the following
                            demarche not only on General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>
                            but on the leaders of all principal groups in Saigon—the Catholics, the
                            Buddhists, the Cao Dai, the military, the Dai Viet:</p>
                        <p>(a) unless, within a month's time, those leaders are able to put together
                            a Government of National Union under civilian leadership, the United
                            States will have to reconsider the extent of its commitment until such a
                            Government is formed;</p>
                        <p>(b) a Government of National Union must have authentic representation of
                            all key ethnic, religious, and regional groups with a commitment to
                            national elections as soon as hostilities cease;</p>
                        <p>(c) such a Government must announce and begin to implement a broad
                            program of political, social and economic reforms, including a
                            cancellation of all peasant debts, land reform, seed and fertilizer
                            programs, etc.</p>
                        <p>(d) the Government must announce the essentials of the <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> Plan<note n="3" xml:id="d26fn3">See vol. II, <ref target="frus1964-68v02#d287">Document
                            287</ref>.</note>—including a major amnesty effort—in order to attract
                            and protect defectors from the Viet Cong so as to provide a sound
                            intelligence base for our military operations and a transition to a
                            post-hostility reconstruction of South Viet-Nam as a national
                            entity.</p>
                        <p>The ability of the Saigon Government to accomplish these objectives is
                            not dependent on the course of the war. If there is to be genuine unity,
                            it can come about regardless of whether the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> is winning or merely holding its own during the rainy
                            season. In fact, the worse the war, the greater the crisis that should
                            instill a willingness to abandon internecine strife and unite against
                            the common enemy. If no such willingness prevails in Saigon, we cannot
                            take over the war ourselves.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Step 4</p>
                        <p>If the leaders of the various factions in Saigon prove unwilling or
                            unable to put aside petty factional jealousies and comply with the US
                            demarche we must be prepared to follow through. We must be prepared to
                            advise the <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> Government—or
                            whatever government may then be in power—that we cannot maintain even
                            the present level of our assistance.</p>
                        <p>It is more than likely that a notice of this kind from the United States
                            Government would have the effect of either</p>
                        <p>(a) inducing the <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> Government to
                            adopt an extreme nationalist position and announce it would go it alone
                            without United States help; or</p>
                        <p>(b) bring about the fall of the <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>
                            Government in favor of a government prepared to try to find a political
                            solution with the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>In either event, we would not expect that American forces would leave
                            quickly. Rather we would expect a protracted discussion between US
                            representatives and representatives of the various Vietnamese
                            factions.</p>
                        <p>Should <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> or his successor demand
                            the immediate removal of US forces from South Viet-Nam, he would almost
                            certainly be ousted by more moderate elements. Even if those elements
                            were neutralist, they would still tend to regard our presence for a
                            period of time as essential to prolonged bargaining with the Viet Cong
                            and Hanoi. Our willingness to cooperate in this negotiating phase could
                            permit us to remain in South Viet-Nam for a considerable period and thus
                            avoid any public appearance of a precipitate and undignified
                            withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>We could use this interval profitably to establish the justice and wisdom
                            of our position with our friends and allies. We could also undertake the
                            necessary diplomatic and economic actions in Thailand and Laos designed
                            to offset so far as possible the immediate shock of the developments in
                            South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Defensive and Affirmative Actions</p>
                        <p>In our anxiety to build up support for the struggle in South Viet-Nam, we
                            have tended to exaggerate the consequences for US power and prestige of
                            a tactical withdrawal from South Viet-Nam. Admittedly, such a withdrawal
                            would create short-term problems, especially in Thailand, but by taking
                            prompt and effective defensive and affirmative measures we should be
                            able to avoid any serious long-term consequences. By and large, the
                            world knows that the government in Saigon is a joke, and if our
                            withdrawal resulted from an effort to face this problem squarely,
                            friendly nations would not interpret it as a US failure to keep its
                            commitments. More likely most nations would consider that we had more
                            than kept our commitments to Viet-Nam—and that our decision to force the
                            issue of stability was a mark of prudence and maturity.</p>

                            should be taken to avoid damage to our position in specific countries
                            and areas.</p>

                        <p>The position taken in this memorandum does not suggest that the United
                            States should abdicate leadership in the cold war. But any prudent
                            military commander carefully selects the terrain on which to stand and
                            fight, and no great captain has ever been blamed for a successful
                            tactical withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>From our point of view, the terrain in South Viet-Nam could not be worse.
                            Jungles and rice paddies are not designed for modern arms and, from a
                            military point of view, this is clearly what General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> described to me as a “rotten
                            country”.</p>
                        <p>Politically, South Viet-Nam is a lost cause. The country is bled white
                            from twenty years of war and the people are sick of it. The Viet Cong—as
                            is shown by the Rand Corporation Motivation and Morale Study<note n="5" xml:id="d26fn5">See <ref target="#d27">Document 27</ref>.</note>—are
                            deeply committed.</p>
                        <p>Hanoi has a Government and a purpose and a discipline. The “government”
                            in Saigon is a travesty. In a very real sense, South Viet-Nam is a
                            country with an army and no government.</p>
                        <p>In my view, a deep commitment of United States forces in a land war in
                            South Viet-Nam would be a catastrophic error. If ever there was an
                            occasion for a tactical withdrawal, this is it.</p>

                        <p>The RAND Corporation has recently completed studies of Viet Cong
                            motivation and morale based on interviews with Viet Cong <gloss target="#t_PW1">PW</gloss>s <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0099"/>and defectors. The studies indicate that while older, hard-core <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have a deep commitment to Communist
                            objectives, the younger, newer recruits have a much more shallow sense
                            of commitment. Morale of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> armed
                            units has been significantly affected by air attacks within South
                            Vietnam. Indeed, preliminary and unpublished findings based on recent
                            interviews indicate that morale has fallen significantly over the past
                            few months as a result of our air harassment.</p>
                        <p rend="center">MOTIVATION AND MORALE</p>
                        <p>The Viet Cong movement embraces a mass of Vietnamese, ranging from the
                            casual peasant supporter who occasionally buys supplies for the Viet
                            Cong on a trip to the local market, to the most deeply dedicated cadre
                            in the main forces. The main forces fall into two generations of
                            recruits: the hard-core Viet Cong cadre and Party member who usually is
                            a Southern Vietnamese “returnee” from North Vietnam where he received,
                            after 1954, five to ten years of systematic training and indoctrination;
                            and the younger generation comprising those recruited mainly after
                            1958.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Hard Core Cadre</p>
                        <p>This group fought as Viet Minh against the French. Many of them were
                            regrouped in the North, but some remained underground in the South.
                            These men form the backbone of the revolutionary effort in the South,
                            which they regard as a continuation of the war of independence against
                            the French. The regroupees were bitter at the United States and the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> for the cancellation of 1956
                            reunification elections and the consequent prolonged separation from
                            their homes in the South. Although many were antagonized by the
                            harshness of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> land reform of that
                            period, they nonetheless appear to have maintained their faith in the
                            wisdom of the leadership in Hanoi.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Younger Generation</p>
                        <p>Whereas the older group joined the Viet Cong mainly for nationalist
                            reasons, the younger generation joined for a variety of motives: protest
                            against social injustice at the village level, lack of opportunities on
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> side for education and

                            fun and games. Intertwined with these as a result of Viet Cong political
                            indoctrination is a desire to protect Vietnam from “the American
                            imperialists and their lackey, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.”
                            Although coercion is used in recruitment by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, it is usually combined with persuasion and patriotic
                            appeals.</p>

                        <p>The Viet Cong claim that they “live splendidly and die gloriously,” even
                            though their living conditions are in fact miserable. Most of those <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0100"/>interviewed believed that the war
                            would last a long time and would end as a result of a gradual exhaustion
                            of the enemy, rather than through a dramatic <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> victory.</p>
                        <p>Defections from the Viet Cong have resulted mainly from personal rather
                            than ideological factors. While defectors and some <gloss target="#t_PW1">PW</gloss>s did criticize the Viet Cong, they more
                            frequently expressed embarrassment or guilt over their own inability to
                            stand the rigors of guerrilla life.</p>
                        <p>The second generation of Viet Cong has a shallower comprehension of
                            Communist doctrine and cites the revolution's goals as simply “peace,
                            independence, democracy and neutralism.”</p>
                        <p>Both generations regard the revolution as an indigenous Southern
                            movement, albeit with some welcome assistance from Hanoi. The
                            nationalistic idealism of the movement is stressed rather than Socialism
                            or Communism. Many Southerners appear uninformed on the extent of
                            Hanoi's role in the war.</p>
                        <p>RAND (and we) are convinced that the flow of defectors could be markedly
                            increased by improved <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> treatment of
                            its <gloss target="#t_PW1">PW</gloss>s. The Viet Cong is now able to
                            convince its men that surrender to or capture by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will only bring torture or execution.

                            OPERATIONS ON <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> BEHAVIOR</p>
                        <p>On the basis of its interviews of Viet Cong captives and defectors, RAND
                            suggests that air harassment should be a major objective of our
                            operations in Vietnam. The Viet Cong are especially fearful of detection
                            and attack from the air, and intensified and continuous air surveillance
                            and harassing activities by day and night are likely to have a major
                            disruptive effect on Viet Cong living conditions, morale, movement, and
                            operations. Air envelopment operations, because of surprise, have a
                            major effect on Viet Cong morale and inflict heavy losses. Recent
                            interviews, not yet published, indicate a growing belief that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> can no longer win the war militarily.</p>
                        <p>Artillery fire is feared by the Viet Cong. Because of good Viet Cong
                            intelligence, however, there seems to be a need for more <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> artillery and frequent changes in the
                            location of the pieces and concentrations.</p>
                        <p>The interviews suggest that intensified ground patrolling has had a
                            significant disruptive effect on Viet Cong operations, and that
                            protracted ground sweeps should be assessed primarily in terms of their
                            harassing impact rather than the casualties they inflict on the Viet
                            Cong.</p>
                        <p rend="center"> RAND CONCLUSIONS</p>
                        <p>“Although the interviews indicate that certain weapons, tactics and
                            operations have a significant effect on the Viet Cong, their impact will
                                <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0101"/>depend not only on their
                            scale and intensity, but also on the way they are integrated into and
                            supported by a range of political, psychological, economic, and social
                            programs designed to exploit fully their effects on the Viet Cong. For
                            example, Viet Cong morale may significantly decline as a result of
                            intensified aerial surveillance and harassment, but the rate of Viet
                            Cong defections will continue to depend largely on the treatment the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> accords to its Viet Cong
                            captives and defectors.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, aerial harassment and attacks may directly lower the scale,
                            intensity and effectiveness of Viet Cong activities, but in the end only
                            the ground forces can transform the Viet Cong from hunters into hunted,
                            defeat them decisively, and establish complete control and security over
                            the population.”</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. As you know from my earlier cables we are considering urgently
                            expanded military actions both in South Vietnam and North Vietnam. Our
                            objective in South Vietnam is to prove to the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> that they cannot win
                            in South Vietnam. To do this we propose to increase U.S./<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military strength to the level required
                            to counter current and likely <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> ground
                            strength. In North Vietnam our objective is further to curtail by
                            airstrikes their capability and will to continue support to the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. At the present time you have in-country seven Marine battalions, two
                            Army battalions and one Australian battalion. We have en <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0102"/>route to you six U.S. Army battalions
                            and two additional Marine <gloss target="#t_BLT1">BLT</gloss>s with
                            support including an F4B squadron and other elements totaling 8,000
                            Marine personnel. This will provide you by 28 July a total of seventeen
                            U.S. and one Australian battalions. There seems to be good reason to
                            believe that Korea will provide one division; however, the timing is
                            unclear.</p>
                        <p>3. We are considering deploying to South Vietnam the air mobile division
                            of eight battalions, the remainder of the 1st Infantry Division with six
                            battalions and one <gloss target="#t_MAB1">MAB</gloss> of three <gloss target="#t_BLT1">BLT</gloss>s, a VFMA squadron and necessary support
                            for a further Marine augmentation of 8,000 personnel. Additionally, we
                            propose to deploy two 105-mm howitzer battalions, one 175-mm artillery
                            battalion and thirteen companies plus two platoons of helicopters
                            (initially five Army and eight Marine Corps), eight platoons of Chinook
                            helicopters and three Hawk battalions. With a field force headquarters,
                            four additional attack fighter squadrons, and additional logistic
                            support, the total U.S. deployment will approximate 175,000 men. The
                            force would comprise thirty-four U.S. maneuver battalions and ten
                            third-country maneuver battalions.</p>
                        <p>4. In your judgment, is this proposed augmentation of U.S./<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> strength sufficient to give us
                            reasonable assurance of achieving the objective set forth in paragraph
                            1, assuming the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> strength continues to
                            be of the magnitude of your present estimates? Obviously, if the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> sizably augment their forces the
                            situation will be changed. In other words, do you need now or foresee
                            the need for more forces than those cited in above references and
                            summarized (I hope correctly) in preceding paragraphs.</p>
                        <p>5. Once more I must ask you to give me your reply <gloss target="#t_ASAP1">ASAP</gloss>. I must have a paper on the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> agenda on Wednesday which reflects your

                        <p>4422. When I called on General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>
                            afternoon June 28 to take up several minor matters, I found him with
                            Generals <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_Chieu1">Chieu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Co1">Co</persName>, the latter having just reported to Saigon as new
                            MinDef. They were all sober-faced and depressed, probably in wake of
                            discussion by <persName corresp="#p_Co1">Co</persName> of military
                            situation in II Corps.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> went straight to his principal
                            point, need for additional US ground combat forces. He is sensing for
                            first time difficulty which we have anticipated for some time of
                            fielding sufficient combat-ready <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            units to cope with growing number of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            units during next few months. He is impressed with need for injection of
                            additional US (or other third country) forces to tide over monsoon
                            offensive period and to take off <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            pressure while mobilization measures are being taken and, to use his
                            expression, “while rear is being cleaned up”. By latter term, he appears
                            to mean actions needed to stimulate pacification, to energize public
                            opinion, and to establish better security measures against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> terrorists. (With regard to latter, he
                            indulged in some reflections on need for reprisal executions of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> prisoners in retaliation for atrocities
                            like the My Canh bombing.)<note n="2" xml:id="d29fn2">See <ref target="#d20fn2">footnote 2, Document 20</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>I told him that on US side we have long been conscious of growing
                            shortage of trained military manpower. We had justified to our govt
                            introduction of US combat forces as means to assist in alleviation of
                            shortage. I reminded him of our announced intention to bring in six
                            additional battalions which, I thought, represented our maximum effort
                            between now and August.</p>
                        <p>What we might consider doing thereafter would depend upon requirements of
                            situation as we might evaluate them. It appeared timely to me for
                            General <persName corresp="#p_Co1">Co</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> to undertake
                            comprehensive review of military manpower requirements between now and

                            to reach it. In general terms, it seemed to me that our objective for
                            period should be to hold population and territory presently under govt
                            control, to blunt and bloody <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> monsoon

                        <p>Generals agreed to this thumbnail estimate of situation and agreed that
                                <persName corresp="#p_Co1">Co</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> should undertake analysis
                            required.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> mentioned that press had
                            questioned him with regard to command relationships in joint US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> ground operations. He had answered to
                            effect that we have been accustomed to operating on basis of combat
                            support with US helicopters and aviation and see no particular reason
                            for drastic change. In any specific tactical situation, command would be
                            worked out in accordance with good sense and sound military principles.
                            He is obviously most anxious to play down issue, recognizing it is
                            sensitive to both parties.</p>
                        <p>I took advantage of discussion of US ground forces to obtain his
                            concurrence for landing of one Marine company at Qui Nhon to add to US
                            defensive strength in this area pending arrival of US brigade next
                            month. This approach was made at General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>'s request.</p>
                        <p>With regard to current issues facing his govt, <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> said that he had just had satisfactory meeting with
                            newspaper publishers whom he had threatened with closing on July 1. They
                            have agreed to attempt to reduce their number to 20 by consolidations to
                            be worked out among themselves. Those who cooperate will be allowed to
                            continue to publish but recalcitrants will be put out of business.
                                <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> has also given them pep
                            talk on subject of loyalty to govt and its policies. <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> does not propose to apply censorship
                            but those who do not show “self-control” can expect trouble from
                            him.</p>
                        <p>From subject of press, we passed to that of better communications between
                            govt and people. <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> says he is
                            aware of inefficiency of govt radio operations and agrees to make new
                            efforts to improve them. I told him that we on our side were prepared to
                            talk television if his people can show improvement in radio field. I
                            mentioned that Barry Zorthian is our contact point for TV
                            discussions.</p>
                        <p>Since Chieu Hoi program is form of communication, I took occasion to plug
                            for better attention to this activity. <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> indicated that it is being temporarily run out of
                            Ministry for Psychological Warfare but eventually will be absorbed into
                            Secretariat for Rural Reconstruction.</p>
                        <p>With regard to visit to Seventh Fleet carrier, <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> indicated he would like to make trip on Thursday,
                            July 1, following trip to Hue-Danang on Wednesday. Because of
                            involvements with <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Eugene Black</persName>

                        <p>Recognizing that there are already several cooks preparing the soup, but
                            confident that the chef is tolerant, we offer the following.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Notes on a Vietnam Political Track</p>
                        <p>In this proposal we suggest a three-fold initiative to be undertaken in
                            the next two weeks. It is an initiative designed to probe the intentions
                            of the other side more fully than has previously been attempted, to do
                            so in such a way as to demonstrate our peaceful intent, but yet without
                            undermining our military and political position in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Despite the present unpromising outlook for political discussions,
                            certain factors make the current context more favorable than future
                            conditions might permit. The <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> remains
                            internationally weaker than it will be once it is formally constituted
                            as a government; the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            have not yet collided militarily in Vietnam—but by design or accident,
                            such a collision will become increasingly likely—and dispassionate
                            Soviet-American discussions less possible—as the conflict escalates; our
                            room for diplomatic maneuver will become narrower as each Viet Cong
                            outrage increases the pressure from the domestic right to retaliate
                            against Hanoi/Haiphong and even Red China.</p>
                        <p>At worst, the three-fold initiative suggested below will simply further
                            prove the unwillingness of the other side to consider peace terms while
                            their hopes for monsoon victories remain high. As a more favorable
                            result, we may obtain useful new information about the views and <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0106"/>calculations of Moscow, Hanoi,
                            and Peking. At best, we might begin the slow process of moving the
                            conflict to a conference table.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Proposal</p>
                        <p>We suggest that three separate actions be taken, in a neutral capital
                            (perhaps Algiers or Cairo), in Moscow, and in Washington, within the
                            next fourteen days. The three actions are related, but need not be
                            simultaneous; their timing should be dictated by certain other
                            variables.</p>

                        <p>Prior to a rescheduled Algiers Conference, the U.S. should make an
                            approach, at the highest level, to three friendly African governments of
                            good international standing (e.g., Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Guinea). We
                            should ask these nations to join together in conveying, on our behalf, a
                            private message to both the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> representatives in Algiers or
                            elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>This message should include:</p>
                        <p>a. a statement of U.S. acceptance of Pham Van Dong's four points as one
                            basis for further discussions;</p>
                        <p>b. a statement of U.S. acceptance of <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Tran Van

                            discussions;</p>
                        <p>c. an offer to send U.S. officials to meet with <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> representatives secretly at any place of their choosing
                            for informal discussions of both sets of proposals as possible bases for
                            more formal negotiations;</p>
                        <p>d. a proposal for a de facto cease-fire to be observed by both sides once
                            these discussions are underway;</p>
                        <p>e. a proposal that if these discussions show any promise, they should be

                        <p>f. a hope that agreement might be reached that would permit the convening

                            tied to a non-Communist outcome in the South; (c) our concern that the

                            threaten world peace; (d) our awareness of the considerable stakes that

                            as long as the compromises left South Vietnam intact as a non-Communist
                            state; (f) our interest in seeing the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> play a peace-maker role—and get the credit—if

                        <p>On the basis of the outcome of the Moscow conversation, or perhaps in
                            conjunction with both the Moscow and Neutral initiative, the President
                            should authorize a 7-10 day pause in our air strikes against North
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The fact of this pause should be communicated to both the Soviets and the
                            Neutrals. Public announcement by the White House should probably be
                            avoided, however, so that we can retaliate if necessary against unusual
                            spectaculars—and reinstitute the air strikes routinely if the
                            initiatives produce no results.</p>

                        <p>1. We have no evidence, to date, that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and/or the Viet Cong have any inclination to modify
                            their objectives with respect to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, or
                            their basic methods for attainment of these objectives. While we can
                            only conjecture as to the extent to which US air action against <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> will be <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0108"/>expanded, or what international initiatives may be
                            taken over the next few months, we do not believe that developments in
                            either field will significantly alter <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> intentions over the
                            next 6 months.</p>
                        <p>2. The foregoing said, the direct answer to your basic question is “no.”
                            In other words, a force of 34 US maneuver battalions and 10 3d country
                            maneuver battalions together with appropriate tactical air and balanced
                            ground combat and logistic support will not provide reasonable assurance
                            of attaining the objective you postulate (convincing the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> they
                            cannot win). The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are too deeply committed to be influenced
                            by anything but application of overpowering force. Consequently, while
                            infusion of US/3d country combat strength on the scale contemplated
                            should reestablish the military balance by the end of December, it will
                            not per se cause the enemy to back off.</p>
                        <p>3. As you fully appreciate, the build up from the 17 maneuver battalions,
                            in position on 1 August, to 40 plus battalions will extend throughout
                            the remainder of the calendar year. Thus, over the next few months, the
                            enemy will retain the capability of overrunning isolated district
                            capitals; of severely interdicting land routes of communications; and of
                            consolidating the rural areas he now dominates. As of January, and
                            providing that the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> has held its
                            own in strength and combat effectiveness, we should be in a position to
                            begin to wrest the military initiative, in selected areas, from the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> forces estimated to be in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. At that juncture (or before), the enemy may elect to
                            further augment his strength.</p>
                        <p>4. With the foregoing considerations in mind, I adhere to the 44
                            battalion package as the proper and necessary scope of deployment
                            authority at this time. (Parenthetically, all should understand that the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> division is a firm part of the
                            military requirement during the next several months. If the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> division does not materialize, a US
                            division must be committed in its place in the same time frame.) There
                            are very practical limitations locally in the logistics areas, quite
                            apart from those which will predictably confront the services. We will
                            be hard pressed to receive, and commit to combat forces of the magnitude
                            contemplated over the next 6 months.</p>
                        <p>5. We cannot now state what additional forces may be required in 1966 to
                            gain and maintain the military initiative. Obviously, many variables are
                            involved—the most important of which is resources <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> may elect to commit. Instinctively, we
                            believe that there may be substantial additional US force requirements.
                            Analytic study of this whole subject is essential, and this we have
                            initiated. We hope to have a fairly solid estimate by early August of
                            the range of additional forces we may require. In this connection,
                            following the Ambassador's conversation with AVM <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> as reported Ref B, I met with General
                                <persName corresp="#p_Co1">Co</persName> yesterday and arranged for
                            follow-on discussions between Depuy and <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> J-3 (<persName corresp="#p_Thang1">Thang</persName>) on
                            a closely <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0109"/>held basis. Through
                                <persName corresp="#p_Thang1">Thang</persName>—and without
                            commitment—we will seek <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> views of the
                            future course of the war, analysis of overall force requirements and
                            estimate of what additional forces, regular and regional, it will be
                            within <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> capability to provide. These
                            inputs will be of considerable value to our essentially unilateral
                            study.</p>
                        <p>6. As seen from here, the requirement for some form of limited
                            mobilization seems clear and pressing. Parenthetically, the impact of
                            national decision to mobilize, albeit in limited degree, might well have
                            more impact on Hanoi/Peking than the deployment of an army corps.</p>

                        <p>4434. For the President. Whatever one may think of General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>, he seems to be serious about
                            fulfilling his campaign promises to stir up the country and get it on a
                            war footing. Impetuous as some of his actions have been, they seem to
                            have the honest intent of energizing an apathetic people and creating an
                            atmosphere of urgency where day-to-day routine has been the rule. With
                            his hip-shooting tendencies, <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> is
                            likely to continue to take ill-advised actions from time to time such as
                            his breach of relations with France but it is just possible that he will
                            be able to create a new outlook favorable to getting things done.</p>
                        <p>The unhappy event of the week was, of course, the execution of Sergeant
                            Bennett on June 24 and the bombing of the My Canh restaurant on the
                            following day. In combination, these two events constitute the bloodiest
                            Viet Cong atrocity which we have suffered and forecast a new technique
                            of further brutalities with the perpetrators shielded by threats of
                            reprisals against U.S. prisoners. It was this prospect which led the
                            U.S. Mission to recommend that Hanoi be held responsible and be made to
                            pay a price for this incident. It seemed to us that the enemy had
                            escalated <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0110"/>and by the rules of the
                            game we should respond—otherwise we would seem to accept this kind of
                            thing as an inevitable new way of life. I have not yet received an
                            indication of the countervailing reasons which led to the contrary
                            decision in Washington but hope to receive them in due course.</p>
                        <p>Military activities picked up during the week with renewed indications of
                            Viet Cong offensive intentions in Kontum Province. Commanders in that
                            area are being faced with the difficult decision of abandoning minor
                            towns under attack or of sending relief forces into areas favoring the
                            ambushes of the enemy. While the former decision is most distasteful to
                            a military commander, there will be cases, I am sure, when the shortage
                            of <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units will angle [argue?]
                            strongly for it.</p>
                        <p>While the number and intensity of Viet Cong incidents were increasing,
                            Viet Cong harassment of communications routes continued to the point
                            that all major routes leading into II Corps are now closed. As a result,
                            we will be obliged to use airlift to assure the delivery of essential
                            military and civilian supplies.</p>
                        <p>Up to now, General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> has only been
                            aware of the air war and is now learning the hard facts of the ground
                            campaign. As I reported in <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss>
                                4422,<note n="2" xml:id="d32fn2">
                                <ref target="#d29">Document 29</ref>.</note> he has appealed to me
                            for additional U.S. ground forces to tide over the monsoon offensive
                            period. I have agreed to have General Westmoreland and the Vietnamese
                            High Command make an estimate to determine where we want to be
                            militarily at the end of the calendar year and what forces will be
                            required to get us there. This should be a useful planning exercise
                            requiring the Vietnamese to face hard facts which they have sometimes
                            preferred to ignore.</p>
                        <p>As suggested above, the economic situation is becoming difficult in the
                            face of Viet Cong interference with road and river transport. This
                            situation, added to the hoarding activities of rice merchants, has
                            presented the new government with a threat of a serious rice shortage.
                            It appears to have won a short-term victory by threatening the
                            profiteers with shooting and at the same time offering modest price
                            increases, a deal which has obtained the promise of delivery of 50,000
                            tons for the government stockpile. This action meets the immediate
                            problem but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJS1">Killen</persName> will wish
                            to discuss the longer term aspects during his consultations in
                            Washington next week.</p>
                        <p>While the economic outlook for the government is far from clear, we are
                            impressed by the competence and motivation of the economic members <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0111"/>of the new Cabinet. If they are
                            kept in place a few months, we think we can make progress with them.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>It has been suggested in some quarters that the United States today finds
                            itself in a position in Vietnam similar to that of the French in 1954.
                            One implication is that we must expect an outcome to our present policy
                            similar to that which befell the French in their defeat and withdrawal
                            of that year.</p>
                        <p>The actual content and applicability of this analogy are discussed in the
                            paragraphs that follow.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The central fact of French involvement in Vietnam was the persistent
                            seven-year effort to re-establish French colonial rule. French forces
                            were pitted against a Communist-led revolution for national
                            independence; at no point did France offer Vietnam the alternative of
                            non-Communist independence.</p>
                        <p>The former Emperor Bao Dai served as the political facade for France's
                            effort to maintain control through a Mandarin elite. Saigon cabinets
                            came and went, while vested interests among Vietnamese and Frenchmen
                            jockeyed for power; but little progress was made toward forming a
                            government capable of rallying Vietnamese nationalist allegiance.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>By early 1953, Viet Minh forces comprised seven regular infantry
                            divisions, with independent regiments equal in strength to two
                            additional divisions—a total of nine divisions. In numbers, the Viet
                            Minh had about 125,000 regulars, 75,000 full-time regional and
                            provincial troops, and 150,000 part-time guerrillas—a total of 350,000
                            men.</p>
                        <p>To combat these forces, the French had committed 175,000 regulars (54,000
                            of whom were native Frenchmen, the rest Legionnaires, Africans, etc.)
                            and 55,000 auxiliaries, plus a naval contingent of 5,000, an Air Force
                            contingent of 10,000 and 225,000 local forces of the three Indo-China
                            states—a total of 470,000 men.</p>
                        <p>By 1952, eight percent of France's national budget was annually allocated
                            to the Indochina war; in 1952-53 nearly 6,000 French and Legionnaire
                            troops were killed, as well as 7,730 of their Vietnamese allies.</p>
                        <p>These impressive statistics imply heavy conventional engagements. In
                            early 1950 the Viet Minh had shifted from guerrilla to conventional
                            warfare, and for the next four years large-scale assaults—ranging upward
                            to 14-battalion strikes—were not uncommon. In 1952 a three-division
                            assault in one province forced the withdrawal of over 20,000 French
                            troops.</p>
                        <p>By 1953 the French were generally engaged in a holding action; the brunt
                            of their forces were tied to defensive duties, and the prospects for a
                            military victory were nil. They had largely retreated to the Red River
                            Delta in the North, some key towns in the Center, and the region around
                            Saigon in the South. Only the equivalent of three divisions were
                            actually available for offensive operations.</p>
                        <p>By 1954 the war's unpopularity at home had brought mounting pressure for
                            negotiation. The Geneva Conference was already under way by the time of
                            France's spectacular tactical defeat at Dien Bien Phu on May 7,
                            1954.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The two central facts of the South Vietnam situation today are the Viet
                            Cong/Viet Minh struggle for control and the process of non-Communist
                            social and political revolution. U.S. forces are present in rapidly
                            growing numbers to help resist the Communists at the request of
                            successive Saigon governments.</p>
                        <p>Since <persName corresp="#p_Diem1">Diem</persName>'s fall, power in the
                            urban South has been passing from the predominantly Catholic and
                            French-educated elite to a more “Vietnamese,” militantly nationalistic
                            and potentially xenophobic group of which the political bonzes,
                            students, and certain young generals are prime examples. While the
                            Communists are seeking to exploit this revolutionary ferment, it remains
                            something quite apart from the Viet Cong <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0113"/>insurgency. Those who aspire to lead the revolution
                            claim that, unless it is successful, the Viet Cong insurgency cannot be
                            defeated.</p>
                        <p>This shift in the alignment of fundamental forces is responsible for much
                            of the political turbulence of the urban scene. It is a process that
                            involves the striking of new power balances in the midst of a war and in
                            the absence of parliamentary traditions or institutions for the
                            channeling of political conflict. Despite their deep antagonisms,
                            neither the Buddhists nor Catholics have acquired political dominance,
                            with the result that each can check but not cancel the power of the
                            other. The same is true of the myriad of other political factions
                            pressing their own interests.</p>
                        <p>While frequent changes in governments have had a debilitating effect on
                            political and administrative stability, as well as on government efforts
                            to create a national consciousness for support of the war effort, there
                            remains an impressive resiliency among the Vietnamese people and their
                            traditional way of life which is little affected by the cabinet changes
                            in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, the most significant element of stability and strength,
                            insofar as the struggle against Communist insurgency is concerned,
                            remains the external factor of U.S. military, economic and political
                            support. Without it, the country would quickly succumb to Communist
                            domination.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">B. The Military Scene</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Viet Cong probably controls somewhat more than 3 million Vietnamese
                            in half the total rural area of the country. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> continues to control rural areas inhabited by an
                            estimated 4.4 million. The remaining rural inhabitants, some 5.4
                            million, are subject to various stages of governmental pacification, or
                            else not controlled by either side.</p>
                        <p>Viet Cong regulars, now estimated at 64,600, are full-time, professional
                            soldiers organized in identified units of up to regimental strength.
                            They are for the most part well trained and equipped. The regulars are
                            distinct from an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 irregular Viet Cong who
                            operate as guerrillas and self-defense militia troops. Another 30,000
                            armed political personnel staff the Viet Cong's party and administrative
                            apparatus. The military activist figure may therefore be as high as
                            194,000.</p>
                        <p>The Viet Cong regular force has the capability of mounting large-scale
                            actions well above present levels of activity. Such actions could
                            theoretically involve as many as nine simultaneous attacks in regimental
                            strength; even a series of coordinated, widespread attacks of lesser
                            magnitude could seriously tax South Vietnamese ability to respond with
                            the limited general reserve battalions available.</p>
                        <p>But the Viet Cong regular battalions vary widely in their combat
                            effectiveness. Some are battle-tested veterans, while others are known
                            to include relatively poorly trained young recruits or recently
                            infiltrated <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0114"/>North Vietnamese
                            draftees with minimal training and little or no combat experience.</p>
                        <p>It is not clear whether the Viet Cong will sustain their currently
                            stepped-up pace, whether present activity is the forerunner of a major
                            offensive, or whether Viet Cong plans have been set back by increased
                            U.S. air activity and troop support. The concentration of Viet Cong
                            forces in northern South Vietnam suggests Kontum, Pleiku or other <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> interior strongholds as their likely
                            targets for a major victory, possibly accompanied by an attempt to drive
                            to the coast from their own inland strongholds, thereby cutting South
                            Vietnam in two.</p>
                        <p>Arrayed against the Viet Cong is the South Vietnamese Army, numbering
                            approximately 220,000 out of the total armed forces of roughly 250,000
                            men.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> is capable of maintaining
                            internal security in the major population centers, in some outlying
                            areas, and along selected lines of communications. While its combat
                            capabilities are affected by frequent command changes at top echelons,
                            insufficient numbers of aggressive leaders and poor but improving
                            logistics, the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> is well supplied
                            with U.S. arms and equipment and has become gradually more effective in
                            guerrilla operations. The <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>, with
                            continuing U.S. military support, has the capacity to prevent a Viet
                            Cong military victory.</p>
                        <p>In alliance with the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> are the U.S.
                            forces in Vietnam which now approach 70,000—a combined US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> total of 320,000.</p>
                        <p>Remaining in the background throughout the present conflict is the
                            seasoned regular army of North Vietnam, numbering over 300,000 men.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. France in 1954</p>
                        <p>Two key aspects of France's relation to the Indochina war in 1954 were
                            the war's acute unpopularity and French political instability.</p>
                        <p>France was never united or consistent in her prosecution of the war in
                            Indochina. The war was not popular in France itself, was actively
                            opposed by many on the left, and was cynically used by others for
                            domestic political ends.</p>
                        <p>The Viet Minh paid careful attention to, drew considerable comfort and
                            encouragement from, not infrequently made good use of these French
                            domestic political factors. (<persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi
                                Minh</persName>'s political and negotiating tactics during the
                            1945-46 period, in fact, were heavily influenced by his belief that the
                            Communists would soon come to power in France.)</p>
                        <p>For a long time, Paris tried to pretend that the war was not a war but a
                            “police action.” Not until July 1952 was the legal status of “veteran”
                            given to Frenchmen who had served in Indochina, and the National
                            Assembly never did permit conscripts to be posted to the Indochina
                            theater.</p>
                        <p>The ambiguous legal status of the conflict enabled French Communists to
                            carry their opposition to the point of sabotage without incurring <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0115"/>the legal charge of treason.
                            Successive French governments had to contend with concerted and
                            organized domestic opposition; resolutions favoring negotiation and
                            early withdrawal were frequently proposed and occasionally passed by
                            non-Communist parties. Leak and counter leak was an accepted domestic
                            political tactic, and, as a result, even highly classified reports or
                            orders pertaining to the war were often published verbatim in the pages
                            of political journals.</p>
                        <p>Pressures for negotiation and settlement mounted steadily in 1953, with a
                            number of prominent politicians—especially Pierre Mendes-France—pushing
                            such themes with vigor. The January 1954 Berlin conference gave new
                            impetus to this pressure, and by February 18 it was decided that a
                            conference should be held in Geneva in April to consider both Korea and
                            Indochina.</p>
                        <p>Dien Bien Phu fell on the day before the opening of the Indochina phase
                            of the Geneva Conference. Had Paris had the will to continue the fight,
                            replacements for that battle's losses could have been sent from France,
                            and the Indochina war might have continued for months if not years.</p>
                        <p>Paris lacked the will, however, and the defeat at Dien Bien Phu made the
                            French Government anxious to disengage as soon as possible. The fall of
                            the Laniel cabinet on June 12 and the advent of Mendes-France as Premier
                            on June 18 hastened the conclusion of a settlement.</p>

                        <p>The central themes of U.S. opinion regarding Vietnam appear to be
                            considerable concern (over U.S. casualties, U.S. involvement, Saigon's
                            political instability, the risks of general war, the use of air strikes
                            and napalm, etc.) but general support for the Administration.</p>
                        <p>In general, the public appears unenthusiastic but reconciled to our role
                            in this conflict. While there is widespread questioning and uneasiness
                            about the way in which we may be playing that role, the public as a
                            whole seems to realize that the role must be played. Furthermore, open
                            skepticism as to our tactics subsides at times of sharp crisis in the
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>The most articulate critics of our present policy in Vietnam have been
                            elements within the academic community and church organizations.
                            Although usually a minority within their own groups, they have
                            stimulated extensive worry and inquiry in the nation as a whole. With
                            the end of the academic year, this protest movement has temporarily
                            subsided.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, the Government's negotiatory posture since April 7th, and the
                            apparent intransigence of the Communists, has made it more difficult to
                            advocate persuasive alternatives to Washington's current track.
                            Criticism continues to be focused on the air strikes, however, and on

                            over 70% of the people believe that Southeast Asia will go Communist if
                            we do not stand firm in Vietnam, and they approve the President's call
                            for unconditional negotiations. Twenty-three percent are not sure about
                            bombings in the North or the sending of more troops during the monsoon
                            season. However, of those with an opinion, almost 80 percent approve of
                            the bombing and over 60 percent believe we should send more troops.
                            Skepticism as to the future of the conflict and our right to be involved
                            in it are expressed by the fact that 35 percent of the people believe
                            that China has the right to ask us out of an area so close to her
                            borders and 32 percent believe we might get involved in a land war we
                            can't win.</p>
                        <p>The latest Gallup Poll (June 9) showed that the percentage of people who
                            believed that we should continue our present course of action climbed
                            from 13 to 20 percent in the last month. Those who believe that we
                            should increase military action dropped from 23 to 21 percent and those
                            who believed we should stop military action stayed virtually the same
                            with only a one point rise to 26 percent. The number of those expressing
                            no opinion dropped from 35 to 28 percent.</p>
                        <p>With some exceptions, most editorialists and columnists support the
                            President in his determination to keep Vietnam independent. This support
                            for the broad objective is tempered by a noticeable strain of criticism
                            over a “lack of frankness” on the part of the Administration in
                            discussing the depth of our commitment. Such criticism was most
                            discernible after the seeming contradiction between the Department of
                            State and the White House over the combat role of U.S. troops and after
                            the Government's handling of the B-52 affair.</p>
                        <p>Those who oppose the Government in the press also seem to be presently
                            concentrating on the demand that the U.S. negotiate directly with the
                            Viet Cong and, to a lesser extent, that the bombings should be stopped
                            again. In general, however, most newspapers appear convinced that the
                            Administration is sincere in its desire to settle the conflict by
                            negotiations and that the intransigence is on the Communists' side.</p>
                        <p>The most vocal current comment on the Vietnam situation is coming from
                            the Congress. Senators <persName corresp="#p_MW1">Morse</persName> and
                            Gruening remain convinced that we must pull out. There is another group,
                            somewhat larger, which could be termed “reluctant realists” whose
                            viscera says get out but whose heads tell them the present policy is
                            unavoidable. Senators <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>,
                            Church and <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> seem to fall
                            in this category. Once again, the problem is one of offering a plausible
                            alternative that would assure the existence of a non-Communist South
                            Vietnam.</p>

                        <p>The most recent Congressional development is the attack spearheaded by
                            Representative <persName corresp="#p_LMR1">Melvin Laird</persName> who
                            states that unless we go for total victory we shouldn't commit U.S.
                            ground troops. He threatens withdrawal of Republican support in the
                            House. It is too early to judge the appeal of this maneuver.</p>
                        <p>Despite obvious Congressional disquiet, Congressional support has been
                            demonstrated in the 512-2 vote last August on the Southeast Asia
                            Resolution and in the votes approving the President's request for a
                            supplemental Vietnam appropriation (408-7 and 88-3).</p>

                        <p>It would seem clear from the foregoing analysis that despite superficial
                            similarities, the situation faced by France in Vietnam in 1954 is not
                            fundamentally analogous to that faced by the U.S. in Vietnam in
                            1965.</p>
                        <p>France in 1954 was a colonial power seeking to reimpose its overseas
                            rule, out of tune with Vietnamese nationalism, deeply divided in terms
                            of French domestic opinion, politically unstable at home, the victim of
                            seven years of warfare—the last four of them marked by military
                            engagements on a scale far greater than anything yet encountered by the
                            U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. in 1965 is responding to the call of a people under Communist
                            assault, a people undergoing a non-Communist national revolution;
                            neither our power nor that of our adversaries has been fully engaged as
                            yet. At home we remain politically strong and, in general, politically
                            united. Options, both military and political, remain to us that were no
                            longer available to the French.</p>

                        <p>(Comments are keyed to the numbered sections in the subject
                            memorandum)</p>
                        <p>1. We are in general accord with the main thesis of the basic paper that
                            something like his “Course 3” is necessary if US objectives in Indochina
                            are to be achieved or, indeed, if the US and its South Vietnamese allies
                            are to avoid the real risk of a major political-military defeat in the
                            next several months. We have reservations about some of the assumptions
                            on which the argument of the memorandum seems to be based, as well as
                            about certain specific actions advocated therein.</p>
                        <p>2. (Introduction) US objective as stated in the first sentence of the
                            basic paper Introduction is very limited—“to force the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to the conference table.” On its face,
                            this seems to fall far short of US objectives since the holding of a
                            conference itself gives no indication of the settlement that might come
                            out of the conference. We wonder whether it was intended actually to
                            narrow previously stated US objectives, or whether the formulation is
                            simply a foreshortened statement. It is our understanding that US policy
                            in Vietnam has had the three-fold end of (1) inducing, or forcing, the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to reduce the level of
                            Hanoi-instigated, supported and directed insurgency in South Vietnam
                            (this will require a combination of suasion, punitive pressure on North
                            Vietnam itself and inflicting defeats on its insurgent forces in the
                            field in the South) and, (2) building up the political and military
                            strength of a non-Communist government in South Vietnam so that, (3) the
                            US can eventually curtail its extraordinary commitment to and
                            involvement in Vietnamese affairs but, when it withdraws, can leave
                            behind a regime capable of coping with the level of politico-military
                            pressures and problems likely to be prevailing at that time. At some
                            point a conference may be a useful step in this process, but it is not
                            an end, in itself, and probably negotiations when and if they take place
                            will only ratify an equilibrium established by military and political
                            power.</p>
                        <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0119"/>
                        <p>We agree the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> may now be winning. They
                            clearly believe they are. We doubt if it will be possible to demonstrate
                            “to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> that the odds are against their winning” unless and
                            until they are in fact losing—which, as the memorandum rightly notes, is
                            not now the case. We cannot realistically hope “to prove to the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> that they cannot win in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and therefore to turn the tide of the
                            war” except by actually beginning to turn the tide against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. Obviously we cannot do this if US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces sustain a series of shattering
                            setbacks during the next few weeks. To have any hope of turning the tide
                            we must, at a minimum, avoid defeat and, under present conditions, some
                            actions along the lines recommended in the memorandum are patently
                            essential if defeat is to be avoided. If we succeed in not losing the
                            war during this monsoon season (through October, say), what we will have
                            won is a chance to settle down to a protracted struggle to contain
                            Communist pressures from the North and help build a stable, viable
                            independent South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>3. (I-A) It appears obviously essential to provide a breathing spell in
                            South Vietnam while the government of South Vietnam and its armed forces
                            can prepare themselves to once again apply the political and military
                            counter-insurgency measures necessary to put the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> on the defensive. It follows, therefore, that the
                            augmentation and deployment of US forces in South Vietnam must be
                            adequate beyond question to prevent an <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> collapse this year.</p>
                        <p>The total in-country military effect of this added US force commitment
                            would of course depend largely on the effective use of the 49 <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> battalions freed for other duties as
                            well as on the use of the additional US and other foreign battalions. If
                            foreign troops are given extensive pacification duties in heavily
                            populated areas, the military results will probably be negligible and
                            the political results adverse. If these troops are used to provide basic
                            strategic defense (hence reassurance against total defeat), to assault
                            fixed and certain concentrations of Communist regulars, and to bail out
                            Vietnamese troops in difficulty, the results should be good. The more
                            directly and effectively US forces can be used in combat against major
                            concentrations and base areas of the Viet Cong, the sooner can it be
                            demonstrated that <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> efforts to win a decisive victory this
                            year are fruitless. It should not be expected, however, that the Viet
                            Cong will necessarily stand and fight against superior forces. Rather
                            they may drop backward a step to smaller-scale harassment and
                            hit-and-run raids in which they do not encounter superior US combat
                            units. Not until they themselves are being hounded, harassed and hurt in
                            many areas without prospect of relief will there be a likelihood of the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> seeking a respite via the conference table or by any
                            other device.</p>
                        <p>We would not normally presume to comment on the exact level and
                            composition of forces required but we are inclined to side with <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>'s views on the undesirability of
                            tying too many US forces to the static <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0120"/>defense of base installations. The added forces
                            proposed would be of obvious value in giving the thinly stretched <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> a strategic reserve it does not now
                            have, screening the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, and generally
                            boosting Vietnamese morale, capabilities, effectiveness and fighting
                            spirits. The net effect of the proposed B-52 sorties could, in our
                            opinion, have a significant influence if promptly and thoroughly
                            followed up on the ground in the areas attacked.</p>
                        <p>4. (I-B) The proposed expansion of aerial attacks on North Vietnam is
                            probably broader than necessary, in view of our conviction that the
                            issue must ultimately be settled in the South, and in view of some of
                            the risks involved. The economic effects of mining the approaches to
                            northern ports, in particular, are not in our view sufficient and in any
                            case not likely to be quickly enough felt to warrant the awkward
                            international political complications such action would entail. There is
                            a better argument for choosing targets whose destruction would
                            immediately put domestic political pressure on the Hanoi regime, e.g.,
                            dock facilities and harbor dredges, power plants and industrial targets,
                            as well as do economic damage to Hanoi's military effort. Destroying the
                            Haiphong harbor dredges alone would, in a short time, have a
                            constricting effect on operation of the port, and in about six months
                            make it virtually unusable because of silting. Moreover, if we increase
                            the pressure on <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> as visualized, one
                            of the quickest ways to signal our serious intent as well as protect our
                            attacking forces would be to destroy the <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> sites and major airfields. While a major Chinese and/or
                            Soviet response cannot be totally ruled out, the risk will not
                            necessarily be increased by pressing our limited-objective attacks on
                                <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. (II-A) While we approve of political gestures indicating our
                            willingness to make a reasonable settlement in Vietnam, most of the
                            initiatives mentioned have been tried to no avail. A serious, official
                            high-level approach to the Soviets would almost certainly be rebuffed
                            since it would expose them to such severe Chinese Communist criticism.
                            This kind of approach could not be successful until we have demonstrated
                            we can stop and turn back the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> attack and are able to face down
                            Chinese Communist threats. Whenever this has been done and the Communist
                            side has had enough in Vietnam, it will find a variety of doors open to
                            a conference room and the Soviets may then assist them to pass through.
                            We stand to gain by keeping the doors open, as we have, but not by
                            over-stressing our anxiety to confer.</p>
                        <p>6. (II-B) The need for this type of initiative within South Vietnam is
                            well established. The two proposals suggested are good starters but of
                            themselves hardly scratch the surface. We feel far more attention must
                            be devoted to the kind of civil and political programs which will be
                            required not only to bring the insurgency under permanent control (even
                            assuming military success), but also to permit South Vietnam to stand
                            successfully <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89" facs="0121"/>against the
                            Communists in the event that a negotiated settlement could be reached
                            and the bulk of US forces withdrawn. It is certain that, in the wake of
                            any such settlement, the Communists would continue their efforts against
                            the Saigon government, either by political means or through outright
                            violation of agreements. There is little point in spending US lives and
                            treasure to obtain a conference or settlement which, in the absence of a
                            viable non-Communist state, must lead either to US re-intervention or a
                            subsequent Communist takeover.</p>
                        <p>7. (III) Over the longer term we doubt if the Communists are likely to
                            change their basic strategy in Vietnam (i.e., aggressive and steadily
                            mounting insurgency) unless and until two conditions prevail: (1) they
                            are forced to accept a situation in the war in the South which offers
                            them no prospect of an early victory and no grounds for hope that they
                            can simply outlast the US and (2) North Vietnam itself is under
                            continuing and increasingly damaging punitive attack. So long as the
                            Communists think they scent the possibility of an early victory (which
                            is probably now the case), we believe that they will persevere and
                            accept extremely severe damage to the North. Conversely, if North
                            Vietnam itself is not hurting, Hanoi's doctrinaire leaders will probably
                            be ready to carry on the Southern struggle almost indefinitely. If,
                            however, both of the conditions outlined above should be brought to
                            pass, we believe Hanoi probably would, at least for a period of time,
                            alter its basic strategy and course of action in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>It might do so in several ways. Going for a conference as a political way
                            of gaining a respite from attack would be one. Alternatively Hanoi might
                            reduce the level of insurgent activity in the hopes that this would
                            force the US to stop its punishment of the North but not prevent the US
                            and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> from remaining subject to
                            wearying harassment in the South. Or, Hanoi might order the VC to
                            suspend operations in the hopes that in a period of temporary
                            tranquillity, domestic and international opinion would force the US to
                            disengage without destroying the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            apparatus or the roots of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> strength.
                            Finally, Hanoi might decide that the US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will to fight could still be broken and the tide of war
                            turned back again in favor of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> by
                            launching a massive <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> assault on the
                            South. This is a less likely option in the circumstances we have
                            posited, but still a contingency for which the US must be prepared.</p>

                        <p>This memorandum is designed to raise questions and not to answer them,
                            and I am afraid it may sound unhelpful.</p>
                        <p>The draft memorandum to the President of June 26<note n="2" xml:id="d35fn2">See <ref target="#d34fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                    34</ref>.</note> seems to me to have grave limitations.</p>
                        <p>1. It proposes a doubling of our presently planned strength in South
                            Vietnam, a tripling of air effort in the north, and a new and very
                            important program of naval quarantine. It proposes this new land
                            commitment at a time when our troops are entirely untested in the kind
                            of warfare projected. It proposes greatly extended air action when the
                            value of the air action we have taken is sharply disputed. It proposes
                            naval quarantine by mining at a time when nearly everyone agrees the
                            real question is not in Hanoi, but in South Vietnam. My first reaction
                            is that this program is rash to the point of folly.</p>
                        <p>2. The memorandum itself points out that the test of the success of any
                            program in the near future will be in South Vietnam. I agree with this
                            view. But I think it far from clear that these drastic changes will have
                            commensurate significance in this decisive field. In particular, I see
                            no reason to suppose that the Viet Cong will accommodate us by fighting
                            the kind of war we desire. Fragmentary evidence so far suggests that
                            they intend to avoid direct contact with major US forces and concentrate
                            their efforts against the Vietnamese Army. I think the odds are that if
                            we put in 40-50 battalions with the missions here proposed, we shall
                            find them only lightly engaged and ineffective in hot pursuit.</p>
                        <p>3. The paper does not discuss the question of agreements with the
                            Vietnamese Government before we move to a 200 thousand-man level. The
                            apparent basis for doing this is simply the increasing weakness of
                            Vietnamese forces. But this is a slippery slope toward total US
                            responsibility and corresponding fecklessness on the Vietnamese
                            side.</p>
                        <p>4. The paper also omits examination of the upper limit of US liability.
                            If we need 200 thousand men now for these quite limited missions, may we
                            not need 400 thousand later? Is this a rational course of action? Is
                            there any real prospect that US regular forces can conduct the
                            anti-guerrilla operations which would probably remain the central
                            problem in South Vietnam?</p>
                        <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0123"/>
                        <p>5. The suggestion of a naval quarantine is particularly drastic and
                            highly important. I think it should be separated from the rest of the
                            paper. A blockade by mining would have both greater risks and much
                            greater impact. It needs a kind of study it has not had (as far as I
                            know) before it is seriously proposed.</p>
                        <p>6. This paper omits certain additional possibilities that should be
                            considered before a specific program of pressure is adopted:</p>
                        <p>(1) It is within our power to give much more drastic warnings to Hanoi
                            than any we have yet given. If General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> is right in his belief that it was the
                            prospect of nuclear attack which brought an armistice in Korea, we
                            should at least consider what realistic threat of larger action is
                            available to us for communication to Hanoi. A full interdiction of
                            supplies to North Vietnam by air and sea is a possible candidate for
                            such an ultimatum. These are weapons which may be more useful to us if
                            we do not have to use them.</p>
                        <p>(2) The paper passes by the possibility that stronger interdiction of
                            north-south traffic might be possible by combining land, sea, and air
                            action. I am not persuaded by what I have heard in casual comments of
                            the impossibility of tightening these pressures by combined action. Is
                            there no prospect that special forces could hold critical strong points
                            in Laos along the <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName>
                            Trail? Is it impossible to tighten controls along the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>? Have we really done all we can in
                            naval patrol?</p>
                        <p>7. The timing of an expanded effort needs examination. It is not at all
                            clear that we should make these kinds of decisions early in July with
                            the very fragmentary evidence available to us now on a number of
                            critical points: the tactics of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>,
                            the prospects of the <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>
                            Government, and the effectiveness of US forces in these new roles.</p>
                        <p>8. Any expanded program needs to have a clear sense of its own internal
                            momentum. The paper does not face this problem. If US casualties go up
                            sharply, what further actions do we propose to take or not to take? More
                            broadly still, what is the real object of the exercise? If it is to get
                            to the conference table, what results do we seek there? Still more
                            brutally, do we want to invest 200 thousand men to cover an eventual
                            retreat? Can we not do that just as well where we are?</p>

                            Meanwhile, I have one further thought that you may wish to be turning
                            over in your mind between now and then.</p>
                        <p>During this week I have had a review made of the economic and
                            informational situation in Vietnam and around the world. It is
                            extraordinarily clear that any further action turns on what we can get
                            the <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> government to do.</p>
                        <p>In this situation, the quality and energy of our team in Saigon becomes
                            decisive. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Max Taylor</persName> is heavily
                            preoccupied with the military situation, and the rest of his team is not
                            geared to a full-steam operation with the new cabinet.</p>
                        <p>So I begin to wonder if it would not be wise to settle hard on the plan
                            for a <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> team, and plan to get them out
                            there together as soon as <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>
                            is briefed and <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>'s
                            successor is chosen. I have already told my brother <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> is the generally preferred choice for this job,
                            and that he should accordingly find the right man quickly for Vientiane.
                            But the decision on the timing of the <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>
                            change is obviously one which only you can make. The more I think about
                            it, the more I think the time of <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>'s takeover should be nearer 1 August than 1
                            September.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</p>
                        <p>We of the United States Mission were very much impressed with the spirit
                            and substance of your twenty-six point statement promulgated on June
                                19,<note n="2" xml:id="d37fn2">See <ref target="#d12fn3">footnote 3,
                                    Document 12</ref>.</note> which we assume is to serve as the
                            overall guideline for impending actions by your government. Because we
                            have been involved in many of the past plans and programs of the
                            government which bear upon the objectives stated in this proclamation, I
                            have asked the chiefs of United States agencies to review the twenty-six
                            point statement and indicate their judgment as to which of the on-going
                            plans and programs should be given top priority to accelerate the
                            attainment of the objectives which you seek. This letter records some of
                            their views and my own as to what needs to be done first to get decisive
                            results fastest.</p>
                        <p>As I see it, the basic problem facing your government in the coming
                            months is to increase the military effectiveness of the Vietnamese Armed
                            Forces in relation to that of the Viet Cong while building the national
                            economy and the national morale. We are deeply impressed that security
                            is the first essential for the political, social and economic progress
                            of your country and that the most praiseworthy efforts to achieve
                            progress in these fields are of marginal utility unless a minimum level
                            of security is established. Hence, we would say that in establishing
                            priorities, number one should go to those measures which will increase
                            the relative military effectiveness in the next few months.</p>
                        <p>If this point of view is accepted, we would then place at the top of our
                            list measures to remedy the critical lack of trained combat ready units
                            in the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>, particularly in the
                            Army. The objective of the monsoon Viet Cong offensive is clearly to
                            destroy as many <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units as possible;
                            the countermeasures should be to punish the Viet Cong, to create new
                                <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units and to rehabilitate
                            those depleted in battle as rapidly as possible. Of the latter, there
                            are presently 4 regiments and 9 battalions which are combat ineffective
                            by reason of severe understrength which is the result of a high
                            desertion rate as well as of enemy action. Hence, the great importance
                            of the plans under way to increase the attractiveness of the military
                            service and to bring down the desertion rate. The plans as we know them
                            are well conceived, but the effect will depend upon carefully checked
                            implementation. If the intake of manpower <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0126"/>can be increased and desertion losses reduced, it may
                            be possible, as General Thieu thinks, to increase the manpower goals for
                            early 1966.</p>
                        <p>To one of your military training, I need hardly comment upon the
                            importance of good leadership as a prerequisite to improve military
                            effectiveness. Somehow we need to learn better how to identify and
                            reward the competent leader and identify and replace the incompetent.
                            With regard to the latter, I have heard with regret of instances of
                            officer failure in the presence of the enemy during recent battles. It
                            would seem to me consistent with the state of war which the government
                            has announced to take drastic disciplinary action against the officers
                            who misbehave on the battlefield. The punishment of a few flagrant cases
                            should have a salutary effect throughout the Army.</p>
                        <p>It is important not only to find competent leadership but to keep it in
                            place when found so that the presence of a strong leader may achieve a
                            lasting effect on the unit which he commands, or on the post which he
                            occupies. Since the fall of the Diem government, there has been a
                            constant turnover of personnel both military and civilian which has had
                            a most adverse effect upon the war effort. I would hope that your
                            government would recognize the self-defeating nature of this practice
                            and resolve to keep competent persons in place.</p>
                        <p>In closing these comments on increased military effectiveness, let me say
                            that my government will in the future as in the past continue to help
                            with air, advisory and logistic support, with military equipment and
                            with United States combat forces, the latter to assist in meeting the
                            manpower shortage during this coming period.</p>
                        <p>While recognizing the prime importance, in the short run, of increased
                            military effectiveness, the correlated problems on the economic front
                            bear heavily on both the short- and longer-term prospects for Vietnamese
                            success in the present struggle. Like most countries in time of war, the
                            South Vietnamese government is obliged to face a mounting budgetary
                            deficit. Your experts and ours are in constant contact on this subject
                            and have always worked effectively together. Thus far, they have
                            protected the country from the potentially disastrous results of serious
                            inflation, but I know that they are constantly concerned over its
                            possibilities and will need your support in carrying out the
                            anti-inflation measures which they may recommend from time to time.</p>
                        <p>As has been illustrated in the recent threatened shortage of rice, there
                            is a serious and growing problem in the distribution of commodities
                            within South Viet-Nam. This difficulty arises both from the operations
                            of the Viet Cong in interrupting land and river communications, and also
                            from the hoarding and profiteering operations which you have vigorously
                            condemned. Thus, the problem requires attention on two fronts; first, in
                            the improvement of sea communications out of reach by the Viet Cong, and
                            second, in the form of legal and police measures to <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0127"/>discourage and eventually to break up
                            hoarding and black market practices. The rice procurement and
                            distribution agency which you have in mind is an important measure of
                            such a program which should also include the further development of port
                            capacities as another essential element.</p>
                        <p>We are of the opinion that a great deal can be done to improve the tax
                            collection system by bringing about a more effective collection of
                            existing taxes and instituting certain additional taxes and customs
                            levies. Such measures would be exactly in line with your announced
                            intention of imposing an austere wartime regime upon the country.</p>
                        <p>I believe the political value of longer-term economic and social
                            development objectives which your government could espouse and support
                            can be very great indeed. The key people in your economic and social
                            ministries are well aware of the need for realistic but imaginative
                            planning in these fields. Our people would welcome the opportunity to
                            collaborate and assist in all possible ways. The timing of our efforts
                            is most important because we should not attempt too much too fast to the
                            detriment of the immediate war effort. But we should be ready to take
                            action at the appropriate time on such an important matter as land
                            tenure which could provide the theme for a most important reform
                            program. I have been impressed with the complexity of this problem and
                            the requirement for adequate time and careful preparation before
                            embarking upon extensive measures. While most authorities seem to be in
                            agreement that many improvements are possible and necessary, I believe
                            they would also recommend against the diversion of the necessary
                            administrative effort in a nation-wide reform program at this time.
                            However, it is entirely possible to initiate certain pilot operations in
                            a few selected provinces from which much experience could be drawn for
                            future use. Such limited actions appear worthy of inclusion in your
                            priority list in order to keep this idea alive.</p>
                        <p>Now may I say a few words about the need to maintain the national morale
                            in these critical times? Military and economic successes are not likely
                            to occur or be sufficient in themselves if the national morale should
                            begin to fail. While no one would argue this truism, it is not easy to
                            decide what specific measures should be taken in first priority to
                            maintain morale. Personally, I would be inclined to recommend focussing
                            attention on the public relations field at the start. Most American
                            observers would say that there has long been a basic problem of how to
                            effect better communication between the government on the one hand and
                            the people, the international world and the Viet Cong on the other.
                            Better communication in turn is divisible into two parts, the technical
                            and the substantial. On the technical side, we have and are continued to
                            be prepared to assist in improving the equipment and organization in the
                            radio and press fields. Also, when the time is propitious, we are ready
                            to work <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0128"/>with you at the problems
                            incidental to the introduction of television. However, these technical
                            improvements are of little avail unless you find persuasive spokesmen
                            for your government able to communicate persuasive themes effectively to
                            the three audiences which I have mentioned above.</p>
                        <p>In communicating with the international world, your government has long
                            been suffering from a dearth of official representation. At the present
                            time, I am told that you have only seven Ambassadors in place in
                            overseas posts. Certainly this reduced representation obliges Viet-Nam
                            to labor under serious disadvantages in defending its case before the
                            outside world. I have several times discussed this matter with Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Tran Van Do</persName> and am sure
                            that he shares my views of the importance of recruiting and placing able
                            Ambassadors as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>In speaking to the Viet Cong, a revitalized Chieu Hoi program might
                            accomplish significant results in detaching the increasing number who
                            are becoming uncertain of the outcome of the struggle. The month of May
                            was the most successful in the history of <persName corresp="#p_Chieu1">Chieu Hoi</persName>, when over 1,000 rallies came over to our
                            side. It is important to act quickly to take advantage of this trend and
                            also to offset any impression that the importance of <persName corresp="#p_Chieu1">Chieu Hoi</persName> has been downgraded in
                            losing its ministerial status.</p>
                        <p>Apart from this matter of better communication with the people, there are
                            a number of other areas which you have mentioned in your twenty-six
                            points which will bear importantly on national morale. A nation-wide
                            anti-corruption program is not only possible but most important for
                            purposes of morale. We have some very practical ideas on ways of raising
                            the ethics and conduct of the public service particularly with regard to
                            corruption which we would be happy to put at your disposition.</p>
                        <p>You have shown a keen awareness of the need to help the war veterans,
                            widows and orphans, a concern which all of us applaud. Justice toward
                            these sufferers of the war will not only raise morale but will also
                            supplement the programs for increasing the Armed Forces and controlling
                            desertion.</p>
                        <p>The last morale-building act which I should like to mention is one which
                            I have raised before. It is the simple matter of cleaning up Saigon and
                            other principal cities. Cleanliness is a mark of pride and self-respect,
                            qualities which normally go with good morale. Could we not demonstrate
                            these two qualities in a practical way by cleaning up the streets and
                            the alleys of this beautiful capital and of the other principal towns of
                            Viet-Nam?</p>
                        <p>This has been an overly long letter, Mr. Prime Minister, but I wanted to
                            convey to you some of our serious thoughts on the priorities which are
                            required in the present emergency to meet the goals you have set for
                            your government. We have resources available to support most of the
                            measures <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0129"/>suggested herein and are
                            most anxious to be of help in any respect. Please let me know if there
                            is any action which you would like from me or other members of the
                            United States Mission.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Introduction.</hi> Our objective is to create
                            conditions for a favorable settlement by demonstrating to the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> that
                            the odds are against their winning. Under present conditions, however,
                            the chances of achieving this objective are small—and the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are winning now—largely because the ratio
                            of guerrilla to anti-guerrilla forces is unfavorable to the government.
                            With this in mind, we must choose among three courses of action with
                            respect to South Vietnam: (1) Cut our losses and withdraw under the best
                            conditions that can be arranged; (2) continue at about the present
                            level, with US forces limited to, say, 75,000, holding on and playing
                            for the breaks while recognizing that our position will probably grow
                            weaker; or (3) expand substantially the US military pressure against the
                            Viet Cong in the South and the North Vietnamese in the North and at the
                            same time launch a vigorous effort on the political side to get
                            negotiations started. An outline of the third of these approaches
                            follows.</p>

                        <p>1. Increase combined US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> ground
                            strength to the level required effectively to counter the current and

                                increase in US presence along these lines (a) would arrest the
                                deterioration and/or (b) would have a net counter-productive “French
                                colonial” effect. If he suggests the latter, ask how he can offset
                                the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> strength advantage without
                                using additional US forces. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> On
                            the assumption that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> strength holds
                            its own, a decision should be made now to bring the US/3d-country
                            deployments to 44 battalions within the next few months. Their mission
                            would include hounding, harassing and hurting the VC should they elect
                            not to stand and fight. General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> says that infusion of such forces with such
                            missions on the schedule proposed “should re-establish the military
                            balance by the end of December.”<note n="3" xml:id="d38fn3">See <ref target="#d31">Document 31</ref>.</note> He continues that “it

                                “instinctively, we believe that there may be substantial US force
                                requirements.” He has a study under way, with a fairly solid

                            carried by Communist tankers. Practically all of the seaborne traffic
                            moves through four ports. Mining of those ports could be launched on 72
                            hours notice, and delayed fusing (three days) could be employed to
                            permit ships time to exit after the fields were laid. A full mining
                            effort to plant all fields would require 97 sorties; the fields could be
                            sustained with 38 sorties per month.</p>
                        <p>b. Destroy rail and highway bridges leading from China to Hanoi. There
                            are 15 highway, 5 railroad and 8 railroad/highway bridges north and east
                            of Hanoi. The railroads now carry between 1600 and 1900 short tons per
                            day. Roads to Hanoi from China can support considerable truck traffic.
                            It would take approximately 1000 sorties to carry out strikes on the 28
                            bridges, with 85% probability of dropping one span in each case.</p>
                        <p>c. Conduct intensive armed reconnaissance of the <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>s from China.</p>
                        <p>2. Destroy the war-making supplies and facilities of North Vietnam
                            wherever they may be located. There are 56 unstruck targets in this
                            category—1 explosive plant, 1 airfield, 5 supply and ordnance depots, 7
                            ammunition depots, 9 <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> storage, 12
                            military barracks/headquarters, 2 communications facilities, 6 naval
                            base/port facilities, and 13 power plants. Approximately 1650 strike
                            sorties would be required to attack all of these targets. About half of
                            them would be suitable for B-52 attack. Only three are likely to lead to
                            more than 100 civilian casualties under daylight alert conditions.</p>
                        <p>3. Interdict movement of war supplies within and out of North Vietnam by
                            an expanded strike and armed reconnaissance program against <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>s west and south of Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>a. Expand strike program against bridges, ferries, railroads and roads.
                            Other than 6 locks-and-dams targets, only 4 bridges and 4 railroad shops
                            and yards remain unstruck in this category. These eight targets would
                                <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0132"/>require approximately 266
                            sorties. Two of them—both railroad yards in Hanoi—would probably result
                            in more than 100 civilian casualties. Three of them—the two Hanoi
                            railroad yards and the Yen Vien railroad yard—would be suitable for B-52
                            strike.</p>
                        <p>b. Expand armed reconnaissance against <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>s. These <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>s south and
                            west of Hanoi, together with the <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>s
                            north and east of Hanoi referred to in para 1c above, should be struck
                            by 1000 sorties a week. This would increase the total strike-plus-armed
                            recce sorties against North Vietnam from 1800 to 5000 a month. (Efforts
                            should be continued in Laos to interdict the “trail” there, and at sea
                            preventing infiltration by water.)</p>
                        <p>4. Be prepared to destroy airfields and <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> sites as necessary to accomplish the objectives of
                            sub-paras 1-3 above.</p>
                        <p>C. In the United States. Even if US deployments to Vietnam are no more
                            than 100,000 men, we should:</p>
                        <p>1. Call up selected reserve forces (approximately 100,000 men).</p>
                        <p>2. Extend tours of duty in all Services.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Expanded political moves.</p>
                        <p>Together with the above military moves, we should take the following
                            political initiatives in order (a) to open a dialogue with Hanoi,
                            Peking, and the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> looking toward a
                            settlement in Vietnam, (b) to keep the Soviet Union from deepening its
                            military involvement and support of North Vietnam until the time when
                            settlement can be achieved, and (c) to cement the support for US policy
                            by the US public, allies and friends, and to keep international
                            opposition at a manageable level. While our approaches may be rebuffed
                            until the tide begins to turn, they nevertheless should be made.</p>
                        <p>A. Political Initiatives.</p>
                        <p>1. Moscow. Place a high level US representative in contact with Moscow to
                            discuss frankly and fully with Soviet leaders our intentions and our
                            desire to find common ground to work with them rather than come into
                            conflict. We would reiterate that US objectives are limited but at the
                            same time we have a firm determination to achieve them. We would stress
                            the dangers we see to both of us in Chinese expansion, and we would
                            recognize the Soviet need to follow a course which does not destroy its
                            leadership in the Communist world. We would press the Soviets to avoid
                            any deeper involvement. We would emphasize that continuation of the
                            military phase can only be harmful to the Communist cause and urge the
                            Soviets to step in (perhaps with British Co-Chairman) to move the
                            situation away from war and toward a peaceful settlement.</p>
                        <p>2. United Nations. As a prelude to expansion of the military effort, we
                            should consider once more putting before the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> the Vietnam question for discussion with the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss>s and North Vietnamese present.
                            They will almost surely refuse to attend and will provide us with a
                            better <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0133"/>position for expanding
                            military action; but if they accept we will have the prospect of
                            negotiations without having stopped our bombing.</p>
                        <p>3. Other international forums. In all international forums and contacts,
                            public and private, continue to demonstrate to the world who is
                            responsible for the trouble in Vietnam and persuade them that our course
                            of supporting the South, including bombings, must be accepted and if
                            possible supported. Whenever we can provide further demonstrations of
                            Communist intransigence and refusal to treat reasonably on this
                            question, this will strengthen our case.</p>
                        <p>4. Geneva Conference. US should propose a Geneva Conference of all world
                            powers (including France) with the subject, “Peace in Southeast
                            Asia.”</p>
                        <p>5. <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>—and US after
                            consultation with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>—should
                            initiate contacts with the Liberation Front and North Vietnam, making
                            clear a readiness to discuss ways and means of achieving settlement in
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>6. <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss>s. If there is any sign of
                            Chinese willingness to begin discussions, US should contact the Chinese
                            to set forth US position including our limited objective and the dangers
                            to China of continuation of the war, and should press the Chinese to
                            bring the aggression against the South to an end.</p>
                        <p>7. <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Canada, India, France, U Thant.
                            Consult individually with the British, Canadians, U Thant, Indians,
                            French and possibly other neutrals to enlist them in taking peace
                            initiatives bilaterally, multilaterally or through international
                            organizations however best calculated to bring about the participation
                            of Communist Governments.</p>
                        <p>8. Other initiatives. In connection with paras 1-7 above, US and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would make it clear they stand ready to
                            take any reasonable action which does not endanger their military
                            posture which might improve the chances of success of any peace
                            initiatives. This could include a bombing “pause.” It could include an
                            explicit restatement of US intention of withdrawing from South Vietnam
                            at the appropriate time, a South Vietnamese announcement of responsible
                            treatment of <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> personnel who remain in the South, emphasis on
                            implementation of President's April 7 offer for economic development in
                            South East Asia,<note n="6" xml:id="d38fn6">See vol. II, <ref target="#d245">Document 245</ref>.</note> etc.</p>
                        <p>B. Initiatives inside South Vietnam. Take steps to induce <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> defections and to increase support for
                            the <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> government—among other
                            steps, these:</p>
                        <p>1. Economic program. Sharply expand program of economic aid in South
                            Vietnam—including a major construction program, junk building, <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102" facs="0134"/>increased rice and pig output,
                            improved distribution and marketing procedures.</p>
                        <p>2. Chieu Hoi program. Improve and expand Chieu Hoi program—with a good
                            man in charge on the US side, and bounties, amnesties, work and
                            educational opportunities, and other inducements.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Evaluation of the above program.</p>
                        <p>A. Domestic US reaction. Even though casualties will increase and the war
                            will continue for some time, the United States public will support this
                            course of action because it is a combined military-political program
                            designed and likely to bring about a favorable solution to the Vietnam
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>B. Communist reaction to the expanded programs.</p>
                        <p>1. Soviet. The Soviets can be expected to continue to contribute materiel
                            and advisors to the North Vietnamese. Increased US bombing of Vietnam,
                            including targets in Hanoi and Haiphong, <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> sites and airfields, and mining of North Vietnamese
                            harbors, might oblige the Soviet Union to enter the contest more
                            actively with volunteers and aircraft. This might result in minor
                            encounters between US and Soviet personnel.</p>
                        <p>2. China. So long as no US or <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> troops
                            invade North Vietnam and so long as no US or <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> aircraft attack Chinese territory, the Chinese probably
                            will not send regular ground forces or aircraft into the war. However,
                            the possibility of a more active Soviet involvement in North Vietnam
                            might precipitate a Chinese introduction of land forces, probably dubbed
                            volunteers, to preclude the Soviets' taking a pre-eminent position in
                            North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>3. North Vietnam. North Vietnam will not move towards the negotiating
                            table until the tide begins to turn in the south. When that happens,
                            they may seek to counter it by sending large numbers of men into South
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>4. Viet Cong. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, especially if they
                            continue to take high losses, can be expected to depend increasingly
                            upon the <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> forces as the war moves
                            into a more conventional phase; but they may find ways of continuing
                            almost indefinitely their present intensive military, guerrilla and
                            terror activities, particularly if reinforced with some regular <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> units. A key question on the military
                            side is whether <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>, ammunition and
                            cadres can be cut off and if they are cut off whether this really
                            renders the Viet Cong impotent. A key question on the political side is
                            whether any arrangement acceptable to us would be acceptable to the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>C. Estimate of success.</p>
                        <p>1. Militarily. The success of the above program from a military point of
                            view turns on whether the increased effort stems the tide in the South;
                            that in turn depends on two things—on whether the South Vietnamese hold
                            their own in terms of numbers and fighting spirit, and on <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0135"/>whether the US forces can be effective
                            in a quick-reaction reserve role, a role in which they have not been
                            tested. The number of US troops is too small to make a significant
                            difference in the traditional 10-1 government-guerrilla formula, but it
                            is not too small to make a significant difference in the kind of war
                            which seems to be evolving in Vietnam—a “Third Stage” or conventional
                            war in which it is easier to identify, locate and attack the enemy.
                            (South Vietnam has 141 battalions as compared with an estimated
                            equivalent number of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> battalions. The
                            44 US/3d country battalions mentioned above are the equivalent of 100
                            South Vietnamese battalions.)</p>
                        <p>2. Politically. It is frequently alleged that such a large expansion of
                            US military personnel, their expanded military role (which would put
                            them in close contact and offer some degree of control over South
                            Vietnamese citizens), and the inevitable expansion of US voice in the
                            operation of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> economy and
                            facilities, command and government services will be unpopular; it is
                            said that they could lead to the rejection of the government which
                            supported this American presence, to an irresistible pressure for
                            expulsion of the Americans, and to the greatly increased saleability of
                            Communist propaganda. Whether these allegations are true, we do not
                            know.</p>
                        <p>The political initiatives are likely to be successful in the early stages
                            only to demonstrate US good faith; they will pay off toward an actual
                            settlement only after the tide begins to turn (unless we lower our
                            sights substantially). The tide almost certainly cannot begin to turn in
                            less than a few months, and may not for a year or more; the war is one
                            of attrition and will be a long one. Since troops once committed as a
                            practical matter cannot be removed, since US casualties will rise, since
                            we should take call-up actions to support the additional forces in
                            Vietnam, the test of endurance may be as much in the United States as in
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>3. Generally (<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> estimate). Over the
                            longer term we doubt if the Communists are likely to change their basic
                            strategy in Vietnam (i.e., aggressive and steadily mounting insurgency)
                            unless and until two conditions prevail: (1) they are forced to accept a
                            situation in the war in the South which offers them no prospect of an
                            early victory and no grounds for hope that they can simply outlast the
                            US and (2) North Vietnam itself is under continuing and increasingly
                            damaging punitive attack. So long as the Communists think they scent the
                            possibility of an early victory (which is probably now the case), we
                            believe that they will persevere and accept extremely severe damage to
                            the North. Conversely, if North Vietnam itself is not hurting, Hanoi's
                            doctrinaire leaders will probably be ready to carry on the Southern
                            struggle almost indefinitely. If, however, both of the conditions
                            outlined above should be brought to pass, we believe Hanoi probably
                            would, at least for a period of time, alter its basic strategy and
                            course of action in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104" facs="0136"/>
                        <p>Hanoi might do so in several ways. Going for a conference as a political
                            way of gaining a respite from attack would be one. Alternatively it
                            might reduce the level of insurgent activity in the hopes that this
                            would force the US to stop its punishment of the North but not prevent
                            the US and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> from remaining subject to
                            wearying harassment in the South. Or, Hanoi might order the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to suspend operations in the hopes that
                            in a period of temporary tranquility, domestic and international opinion
                            would force the US to disengage without destroying the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> apparatus or the roots of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> strength. Finally, Hanoi might decide
                            that the US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will to fight could
                            still be broken and the tide of war turned back again in favor of the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> by launching a massive <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> assault on the South. This is a less
                            likely option in the circumstances we have posited, but still a
                            contingency for which the US must be prepared.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. U.S. Objective</p>
                        <p>The central objective of the United States in South Viet-Nam must be to
                            insure that North Viet-Nam not succeed in taking over or determining the
                            future of South Viet-Nam by force. We must accomplish this objective
                            without a general war if possible.</p>
                        <p>The “war aim” of the United States is not concerned with what the South
                            Vietnamese would do if they were left alone. There are many problems in
                            the country which only the South Vietnamese can solve. U.S. forces are
                            present in South Viet-Nam only because of the aggression of Hanoi in
                            sending men and arms into the South. If this aggression were removed,
                            U.S. forces could be withdrawn. We would not use U.S. forces <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0137"/>to settle issues in South Viet-Nam
                            among the Buddhists, Catholics, the sects, the local Chinese and
                            Cambodian communities, the Montagnards, and the genuinely “indigenous”
                            Viet Cong. The sole basis for employing U.S. forces is the aggression
                            from the North.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. U.S. Commitments</p>
                        <p>There can be no serious debate about the fact that we have a commitment
                            to assist the South Vietnamese to resist aggression from the North. If
                            the South Vietnamese were to ask us to withdraw our help, we would have
                            to do so. There is no present likelihood that they will do so.</p>
                        <p>The integrity of the U.S. commitment is the principal pillar of peace
                            throughout the world. If that commitment becomes unreliable, the
                            communist world would draw conclusions that would lead to our ruin and
                            almost certainly to a catastrophic war. So long as the South Vietnamese
                            are prepared to fight for themselves, we cannot abandon them without
                            disaster to peace and to our interests throughout the world.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Comment on the present situation</p>
                        <p>There is no question but that the situation in South Viet-Nam is
                            critical. It is said that we are “losing”; this means that we are not
                            making headway, but rather falling behind, in the effort to stop the
                            infiltration and to pacify the country. But that does not mean that the
                            Viet Cong are “winning”; they have the power to disrupt, but they are
                            not capable of occupying and organizing the country or any major part of
                            it. The Viet Cong can be denied a victory, even if complete pacification
                            will be a long and tortuous prospect.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. The Risks</p>
                        <p>There are obvious risks in any engagement between free and communist
                            countries, especially where large communist countries are contiguous to
                            the area of conflict. But these risks are present for the communists as
                            well. If they discover that we are less resolved than they, the prospect
                            for the future is exceedingly dark. Moscow and Peiping do not wish a
                            general war with us over Southeast Asia. Our problem, therefore, is to
                            deny to Hanoi success in South Viet-Nam without taking action on our
                            side which would force the other side to move to higher levels of
                            conflict. If they decide to move to a larger war rather than fail to
                            absorb South Viet-Nam, we could not shrink from that eventuality; but
                            such a decision on their part does not appear likely. It is least likely
                            in relation to what we do in South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">5. Main Courses of Action</p>
                        <p>a. Maximum South Vietnamese effort.</p>
                        <p>We must use the leverage of U.S. presence and assistance to insist that
                            South Vietnamese leaders declare a moratorium on their bickering <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0138"/>and knuckle down to the
                            increased effort needed to defeat the Viet Cong. They must be told
                            bluntly that they cannot take us for granted but must earn our help by
                            their own performance.</p>
                        <p>b. A level of U.S. effort in South Viet-Nam, as a supplement to the best
                            the South Vietnamese can do, to deny a Viet Cong success.</p>
                        <p>Even present levels of U.S. forces are not yet reflected in corresponding
                            damage to the Viet Cong. Reinforcements now in course should open the
                            way to a war plan to engage concentrations of Viet Cong with punishing
                            effect.</p>
                        <p>c. Maintenance of present character of air action against North Viet-Nam,
                            both for its practical effects and to establish that there is no
                            sanctuary for participants in the war.</p>
                        <p>The elimination of the sanctuary is the principal brake upon direct
                            Chinese participation. We should not, for the present, attack targets in
                            the immediate Hanoi-Haiphong area. Priority should be given to any need
                            for air strikes on targets in South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>d. Intensify the mobilization of “other flags” in support of South
                            Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>e. Pursue our readiness to seek a peaceful solution through any available
                            channel.</p>
                        <p>f. Initiate as soon as possible the “Acheson Plan” in South Viet-Nam; if
                            not for the entire country, perhaps in the III and IV Corps, or in
                            selected provinces around Saigon.</p>

                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">A Losing War:</hi> The South Vietnamese are losing
                            the war to the Viet Cong. No one can assure you that we can beat the
                            Viet Cong or even force <pb n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0139"/>them to
                            the conference table on our terms no matter how many hundred thousand
                            white foreign (US) troops we deploy.</p>
                        <p>No one has demonstrated that a white ground force of whatever size can
                            win a guerrilla war—which is at the same time a civil war between
                            Asians—in jungle terrain in the midst of a population that refuses
                            cooperation to the white forces (and the <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>) and thus provides a great intelligence advantage to
                            the other side. Three recent incidents vividly illustrate this
                            point:</p>
                        <p>(a) The sneak attack on the Danang Air Base which involved penetration of
                            a defense perimeter guarded by 9,000 Marines. This raid was possible
                            only because of the cooperation of the local inhabitants.</p>
                        <p>(b) The B-52 raid that failed to hit the Viet Cong who had obviously been
                            tipped off.</p>
                        <p>(c) The search-and-destroy mission of the 173rd Airborne Brigade which
                            spent three days looking for the Viet Cong, suffered 23 casualties, and
                            never made contact with the enemy who had obviously gotten advance word
                            of their assignment.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The Question to Decide:</hi> Should we limit our
                            liabilities in South Viet-Nam and try to find a way out with minimal
                            long-term costs?</p>
                        <p>The alternative—no matter what we may wish it to be—is almost certainly a
                            protracted war involving an open-ended commitment of US forces, mounting
                            US casualties, no assurance of a satisfactory solution, and a serious
                            danger of escalation at the end of the road.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Need for a Decision Now:</hi> So long as our forces
                            are restricted to advising and assisting the South Vietnamese, the
                            struggle will remain a civil war between Asian peoples. Once we deploy
                            substantial numbers of troops in combat it will become a war between the
                            United States and a large part of the population of South Viet-Nam,
                            organized and directed from North Viet-Nam and backed by the resources
                            of both Moscow and Peiping.</p>
                        <p>The decision you face now, therefore, is crucial. Once large numbers of
                            US troops are committed to direct combat they will begin to take heavy
                            casualties in a war they are ill-equipped to fight in a non-cooperative
                            if not downright hostile countryside.</p>
                        <p>Once we suffer large casualties we will have started a well-nigh
                            irreversible process. Our involvement will be so great that we
                            cannot—without national humiliation—stop short of achieving our complete
                            objectives. Of the two possibilities I think humiliation would be more
                            likely than the achievement of our objectives—even after we had paid
                            terrible costs.</p>

                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Costs of Compromise Solution:</hi> The answer
                            involves a judgment as to the costs to the United States of such a
                            compromise settlement in terms of our relations with the countries in
                            the area of South Viet-Nam, the credibility of our commitments and our
                            prestige around the world. In my judgment, if we act before we commit
                            substantial US forces to combat in South Viet-Nam we can, by accepting
                            some short-term costs, avoid what may well be a long-term catastrophe. I
                            believe we have tended greatly to exaggerate the costs involved in a
                            compromise settlement. An appreciation of probable costs is contained in
                            the attached memorandum. (Tab A)</p>
                        <p>6. With these considerations in mind, I strongly urge the following

                            any targets nearer to the Chinese border than those already struck.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">B. Political Program</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(1) In any political approaches so far, we have been the prisoners of
                            whatever South Vietnamese Government was momentarily in power. If we are
                            ever to move toward a settlement it will probably be because the South
                            Vietnamese Government pulls the rug out from under us and makes its own
                            deal or because we go forward quietly without advance pre-arrangement
                            with Saigon.</p>
                        <p>(2) So far we have not given the other side a reason to believe that
                            there is any flexibility in our negotiating approach. And the other side
                            has been unwilling to accept what in their terms is complete
                            capitulation.</p>
                        <p>(3) Now is the time to start some serious diplomatic feelers, looking
                            towards a solution based on some application of the self-determination
                            principle.</p>
                        <p>(4) I would recommend approaching Hanoi rather than any of the other
                            probable parties (the National Liberation Front, Moscow or Peiping).
                            Hanoi is the only one that has given any signs of interest in
                            discussion. Peiping has been rigidly opposed. Moscow has recommended
                            that we negotiate with Hanoi. The National Liberation Front has been
                            silent.</p>
                        <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0141"/>
                        <p>(5) There are several channels to the North Vietnamese but I think the
                            best one is through their representative in Paris, Mai Van Bo. Initial
                            feelers with Bo should be directed toward a discussion both of the four
                            points we have put forward and the four points put forward by Hanoi as a
                            basis for negotiation. We can accept all but one of Hanoi's four points
                            and hopefully we should be able to agree on some ground rules for
                            serious negotiation—including no pre-conditions.</p>
                        <p>(6) If the initial feelers lead to further secret exploratory talks we
                            can inject the concept of self-determination that would permit the Viet
                            Cong some hope of achieving some of their political objectives through
                            local elections or some other device.</p>
                        <p>(7) The contact on our side should be handled through a non-governmental
                            cutout (possibly a reliable newspaperman who can be repudiated.)</p>
                        <p>(8) If progress can be made at this level the basis can be laid for a
                            multi-national conference. At some point obviously the government of
                            South Viet-Nam will have to be brought on board but I would postpone
                            this step until after a substantial feeling out of Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>(9) Before moving to any formal conference we should be prepared to agree
                            that once the conference is started (a) the United States will stand
                            down its bombing of the North, (b) the South Vietnamese will initiate no
                            offensive operations in the South, and (c) the DRV will stop terrorism
                            and other aggressive acts in the South.</p>
                        <p>(10) Negotiations at the conference should aim at incorporating our
                            understanding with Hanoi in the form of a multi-national agreement
                            guaranteed by the United States, the Soviet Union and possibly other
                            parties, and providing for an international mechanism to supervise its
                            execution.</p>

                            VIET-NAM</p>
                        <p>We have tended to exaggerate the losses involved in a compromise
                            settlement in South Viet-Nam. There are three aspects of the problem
                            which should be considered:</p>
                        <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0142"/>
                        <p>First, the local effect of our action on nations in or near Southeast
                            Asia.</p>
                        <p>Second, the effect of our action on the credibility of our commitments
                            around the world.</p>
                        <p>Third, the effect on our position of world leadership.</p>
                        <p rend="center">A. Effect on Nations in or Near Southeast Asia</p>
                        <p>Free Asian reactions to a compromise settlement in South Viet-Nam would
                            be highly parochial, with each country interpreting the event primarily
                            in terms of (a) its own immediate interest, (b) its sense of
                            vulnerability to Communist invasion or insurgency, and (c) its
                            confidence in the integrity of our commitment to its own security based
                            on evidence other than that provided by our actions in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Within this framework, the following groupings emerge:</p>
                        <p>1. The Republic of China and Thailand, staunch allies whose preference
                            for extreme U.S. actions, including a risk of war with Communist China,
                            sets them apart from all other Asian nations;</p>
                        <p>2. The Republic of Korea and the Philippines, equally staunch allies
                            whose support for strong U.S. actions short of a war with Communist
                            China would make post-settlement reassurance a pressing U.S. need;</p>
                        <p>3. Japan, an ally that would prefer wisdom to valor in an area remote
                            from its own interests where escalation could involve its Chinese or
                            Russian neighbors, or both;</p>
                        <p>4. Laos, a friendly neutral dependent on a strong Thai-US guarantee of
                            support in the face of increased Vietnamese-Pathet Lao pressures;</p>
                        <p>5. Burma and Cambodia, suspicious neutrals whose fear of antagonizing
                            Communist China would increase their leaning toward Peking in a
                            conviction that the US presence is not long for Southeast Asia; and</p>
                        <p>6. Indonesia, whose opportunistic marriage of convenience with both Hanoi
                            and Peking would carry it further in its covert aggression against
                            Malaysia, convinced that “foreign imperialism” is a fast fading entity
                            in the region.</p>
                        <p>Of these varied reactions, the critical importance of Japan and Thailand
                            calls for more detailed examination.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Japan</p>
                        <p>According to our Embassy, Japanese public opinion is largely unreceptive
                            to our interpretation of the situation in Viet-Nam. Many if not most
                            Japanese consider that the US is endeavoring to prop up a tottering
                            government that lacks adequate indigenous support. Public media stress
                            the civil war aspects of the struggle, portray Hanoi's resistance as
                            determined and justified, and question our judgment as to the dangers of
                            an eventual war with Communist China.</p>
                        <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0143"/>
                        <p>The government as such supports our strong posture in Viet-Nam but stops
                            short at the idea of a war between the US and China. Governmental
                            leadership can—to a considerable extent—influence the public reaction in
                            Japan. Government cooperation would, therefore, be essential in making
                            the following points to the Japanese people: (1) US support was given in
                            full measure, as shown by our casualties, our expenditures, and our
                            risk-taking; and (2) the US record in Korea shows the credibility of our
                            commitment so far as Japan is concerned.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Thailand</p>
                        <p>Thai commitments to the struggles in Laos and South Viet-Nam are based
                            upon a careful evaluation of the regional threat to Thailand's security.
                            The Thais are confident that they can contain any threats from Indochina
                            alone. They know, however, that they cannot withstand the massive power
                            of Communist China without foreign assistance.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, the Thai view of the war has seriously erred in
                            fundamental respects. They believe American power can do anything, both
                            militarily and in terms of shoring up a Saigon regime. They now assume
                            that we really could take over in Saigon and win the war if we felt we
                            had to. If we should fail to do so the Thais would initially see it as a
                            failure of US will.</p>
                        <p>Yet time is on our side, provided we employ it effectively. Thailand is
                            an independent nation with a long national history and—unlike South
                            Viet-Nam—an acute national consciousness. It has few domestic Communists
                            and none of the instability that plagues its neighbors, Burma and
                            Malaysia. Its one danger area, in the Northeast, is well in hand so far
                            as preventive measures against insurgency are concerned. Securing the
                            Mekong Valley will be critical in any long-run solution, whether by the
                            partition of Laos, with Thai-US forces occupying the western half, or by
                            some cover arrangement. Provided we are willing to make the effort,
                            Thailand can be a foundation of rock and not a bed of sand on which to
                            base our political-military commitment to Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">South Korea</p>
                        <p>As for the rest of the Far East, the only serious point of concern might
                            be South Korea. But if we stop pressing the Koreans for more troops to
                            Viet-Nam (the Vietnamese show no desire for additional Asian forces
                            since it affronts their sense of pride) we may be able to cushion Korean
                            reactions to a compromise in South Viet-Nam by the provision of greater
                            military and economic assistance. In this regard, Japan can play a
                            pivotal role now that it has achieved normal relations with South
                            Korea.</p>

                            Credibility of Our Commitments Around the World</p>
                        <p>With the exception of the nations in the Southeast Asian area, a
                            compromise settlement in South Viet-Nam should not have a major impact
                            on the credibility of our commitments around the world. Quite possibly
                            President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> will make
                            propaganda about perfidious Washington, but even he will be inhibited by
                            his much-heralded disapproval of our activities in South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> has told us
                            privately that the people of Berlin would be concerned by a compromise
                            settlement in South Viet-Nam. But this was hardly an original thought
                            and I suspect he was telling us what he believed we would like to hear.
                            After all, the confidence of the West Berliners will depend more on what
                            they see on the spot than on news of events half way around the world.
                            They have much to gain by the prevention of a confrontation between East
                            and West elsewhere and by the gradual developments of a spirit of
                            entente that might pave the way for ultimate reunification.</p>
                        <p>In my observation, the principal anxiety of our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies is that we have become too preoccupied with an
                            area which seems to them an irrelevance and may be tempted to neglect
                            our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> responsibilities. Moreover,
                            they have a vested interest in an easier relationship between Washington
                            and Moscow.</p>
                        <p>By and large, therefore, they would be inclined to regard a compromise
                            solution in South Viet-Nam more as new evidence of American maturity and
                            judgment than of American loss of face.</p>
                        <p>These would be the larger and longer-term reactions of the Europeans. In
                            the short run, of course, we could expect some cat-calls from the
                            sidelines and some vindictive pleasure on the part of Europeans jealous
                            of American power. But that would, in my view, be a transient phenomenon
                            with which we could live without sustained anguish.</p>
                        <p>Elsewhere around the world, I would see few unhappy implications for the
                            credibility of our commitments. No doubt the Communists will try to gain
                            propaganda value in Africa, but I cannot seriously believe that the
                            Africans care too much about what happens in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>Australia and New Zealand are, of course, special cases since they feel
                            lonely in the far reaches of the Pacific. Yet even their concern is far
                            greater with Malaysia than with South Viet-Nam, and the degree of their
                            anxiety would be conditioned largely by expressions of our support for
                            Malaysia.</p>
                        <p rend="center">C. Effect on Our Position of World Leadership</p>
                        <p>On balance I believe we would more seriously undermine the effectiveness
                            of our world leadership by continuing the war and deepening our
                            involvement than by pursuing a carefully plotted course toward a
                            compromise solution. In spite of the number of powers that have—in
                            response to our pleading—given verbal support from feelings of loyalty
                            and dependence, we cannot ignore the fact that the war is vastly
                            unpopular and that our role in it is perceptibly eroding the respect and
                            confidence <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0145"/>with which other
                            nations regard us. We have not persuaded either our friends or allies
                            that our further involvement is essential to the defense of freedom in
                            the Cold War. Moreover, the more men we deploy in the jungles of South
                            Viet-Nam, the more we contribute to the growing world anxiety and
                            mistrust.</p>

                                latter's request. Bundy drafted it after helping <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> prepare his June 28 paper
                                    (<ref target="#d26">Document 26</ref>) advocating U.S.
                                withdrawal from Vietnam. Bundy could not agree with that conclusion,
                                and was influenced by <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">U. Alexis
                                    Johnson</persName>, who believed that military reports from
                                Vietnam were too bleak and that the introduction of more than 15
                                U.S. battalions would cause serious problems for the South
                                Vietnamese Government. Accordingly, Bundy concluded that “there must
                                be a presentation to the President of a military operation looking
                                not to early compromise on the most crucial issue, but to a genuine
                                trial period to see if the South Vietnamese were tough and American
                                forces effective.” The memorandum printed here was a summary of a
                                longer memorandum, dated June 29, entitled “Holding On in South
                                Vietnam,” which was discussed on June 30 by the senior review group
                                that earlier had discussed <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s June 28 paper. (Johnson Library, Papers of

                        <p rend="center">A “MIDDLE WAY” COURSE OF ACTION IN SOUTH VIETNAM</p>
                        <p>This memorandum advocates the following military decisions as the basis
                            for US action during the next two months:</p>
                        <p>a. Complete the deployment of the balance of the Marine force at Da Nang
                            (early July), and of the additional six battalions from the 1st and
                            101st Divisions (July 15 and July 28). This would bring combat strength
                            to 18 battalions, and overall US strength to about 85,000.</p>
                        <p>b. Revise the current decision on the Air Mobile Division so that this
                            division is alerted and could be sent to South Vietnam three weeks after
                            decision at any time, but not decide now that it will in fact be
                            sent.</p>
                        <p>c. Start now to weed out and prepare for deployment as many combat units
                            as possible to meet the possible military need for 44 combat <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0146"/>battalions by the end of the year, but
                            defer any decision on deploying these units and on calling up major
                            reserve units. (<gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> should supply the
                            time factors and indicate whether and to what extent such deferral would
                            prevent our meeting the possible force needs if we later decided to do
                            so.)</p>
                        <p>d. Continue to avoid the urban areas of Hanoi and Haiphong in our bombing
                            of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, being prepared to attack
                                <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> sites and airfields if but only
                            if they are used to inflict militarily significant losses on us. Hitting
                            these cities would not now lead Hanoi to give in but might on the
                            contrary toughen it. It would almost certainly lose us the support of
                            such key governments as the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Japan.
                            Above all, it would inevitably intensify the Soviet commitment and
                            probably remove the chance of the Soviets exerting restraint in the
                            fall.</p>
                        <p>e. Defer decision on mining North Vietnamese harbors and/or cutting the
                            rail and road lines from China to North Vietnam. The harbor operation
                            would tend to throw North Vietnam into the arms of Communist China and
                            diminish Soviet influence. The rail and road operation could be useful
                            added pressure but should be held in reserve; it would have much more
                            effect if it came after a summer stalemate, and it cannot affect <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> capabilities in the short term or
                            perhaps to any major degree.</p>
                        <p>f. Maximum air action in the South, including B-52's.</p>
                        <p>This military program would be accompanied by every effort to galvanize
                            the political and economic programs of the <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> Government, in the direction of “maximum revolution
                            and reform, but minimum repression.” We would be preparing the way for a
                            really major reform and amnesty program to be launched in the fall if
                            the monsoon offensive is blunted so that such action would not have a
                            note of weakness.</p>
                        <p>The program also involves the possibility of discreet contacts with
                            Hanoi, and cut-out contacts (not identified with the US) with the
                            Liberation Front. These would not be with any serious negotiating
                            expectations, but to open channels and to soften both up by playing on
                            Hanoi's fear of Peiping and the possible Liberation Front fear of being
                            totally under Hanoi's domination.</p>
                        <p>In essence, this is a program to hold on for the next two months, and to
                            test the military effectiveness of US combat forces and the reaction of
                            the Vietnamese army and people to the increasing US role. Basic to the
                            program is that US combat forces would be employed on a fairly strict
                            interpretation of the June 9 White House statement, used in combat as
                            reserves where a battle has been or can be joined and US military
                            advantages are greatest, not in general countryside operations.</p>
                        <p>The program rejects withdrawal or negotiating concessions in any form,
                            and equally rejects a present decision to raise our force level above
                            about 85,000. The latter appears unwise because:</p>
                        <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0147"/>
                        <p>a. We have not tested whether our forces can really find and hit the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. This program gives us enough
                            reserves to give a fair test.</p>
                        <p>b. We simply do not know, and probably cannot now know, whether raising
                            the US force level and combat involvement to the point where we take
                            over much of the combat load would (1) cause the Vietnamese government
                            and especially the army to let up; (2) create adverse popular reactions
                            to our whole presence, on “white men” and “like the French” grounds. So
                            far things have been all right while we were sticking to secure areas
                            and were not in combat; we just don't know what will happen when we
                            start fighting and are in contact with the people in disputed areas. At
                            some point, we could be playing into <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            hands, and negating immediate military results, thus getting into a
                            truly disastrous situation. Again, what we need now is to test; perhaps,
                            these fears will be groundless, but we lose little by waiting, compared
                            to the risks. And these risks are affected by pace and timing; we might
                            be readily accepted if we moved gradually, but arouse the world fears
                            and adverse reactions if we moved fast.</p>
                        <p>c. While military effectiveness is the basic reason for holding at about
                            85,000, we must also reckon the Congressional and public opinion
                            problems of embarking now on what might appear clearly to be an
                            open-ended ground commitment. The present rationale of meeting the
                            monsoon offensive and balancing <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            regulars has put us on a solid and sober footing for 85,000; any major
                            increases would require a much broader base and explanation.</p>

                        <p>I have just come from another long session in the State Department on the

                            recommendation of a substantial increase of military strength, with a
                            call-up of reserves during this summer.</p>
                        <p>I find that both Rusk and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> feel strongly that the <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName> paper should not be argued
                            with you in front of any audience larger than yourself, Rusk, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, and me. They feel that it is exceedingly dangerous
                            to have this possibility reported in a wider circle. Moreover, both of
                            them feel great reticence about expressing their own innermost thoughts
                            to you in front of any larger group. So they both would prefer a meeting
                            limited to the five of us in the morning.</p>
                        <p>The disadvantage of this is that it cuts you off from a chance to talk
                            freely with some other men who have expert opinions—like <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> (whom I can easily take care of
                            in another way by having him read the papers and get ready to report
                            separately to you at another time).</p>
                        <p>In the light of Bob's and Dean's feeling, however, I now recommend we
                            keep this meeting small. After you have had a chance to get your own
                            thinking clear on the broad outlines of the problem, we can bring in
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>, and others in a later meeting for more intense
                            discussion of a specific set of recommendations. My personal, private
                            opinion is that both Rusk and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> are too diffident and that it would help you to
                            have a few more people in the meeting. But it is a fact that they feel
                            as they do, and this feeling will govern their effectiveness in a
                                meeting.<note n="3" xml:id="d42fn3">Two options were typed below

                        <p>At Tab 1 is Dean Rusk's four-page statement of the basic issues.</p>
                        <p>At Tab 2 is <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName>'s paper on
                            a compromise solution.</p>
                        <p>At Tab 3 is Bob McNamara's recommendation for expanded military
                            action.</p>
                        <p>At Tab 4 is my brother <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName>'s
                            program offering a middle course for the next two months.</p>
                        <p>The positions within the government are roughly as follows: <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> honestly believe in their own
                            recommendations, though Bob would readily accept advice to tone down
                            those of his recommendations which move rapidly against Hanoi by bombing
                            and blockade.</p>
                        <p>Dean Rusk leans toward the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> program, adjusted downward in this same
                            way.</p>
                        <p>The second-level men in both State and Defense are not optimistic about
                            the future prospects in Vietnam and are therefore very reluctant to see
                            us move to a 44 battalion force with a call-up of reserves. So they
                            would tend to cluster around the middle course suggested by my brother.
                            They would like to see what happens this summer before getting much
                            deeper in.</p>
                        <p>The Joint Chiefs are strongly in favor of going in even further than
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. Specifically they
                            want now to take out the <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> site, the
                            IL-28s, and the <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>s in the Hanoi
                            area.</p>
                        <p>My hunch is that you will want to listen hard to <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName> and then reject his
                            proposal. Discussion could then move to the narrower choice between my
                            brother's course and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s.
                            The decision between them should be made in about ten days, which is the
                            point at which <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> would
                            like a final go-ahead on the air mobile division. I think you may want
                            to have pretty tight and hard analyses of some disputed questions like
                            the following:</p>
                        <p>1. What are the chances of our getting into a white man's war with all
                            the brown men against us or apathetic?</p>
                        <p>2. How much of the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            planning would be on a contingency basis with no decision until August
                            or September?</p>
                        <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0150"/>
                        <p>3. What would a really full political and public relations campaign look
                            like in both the Bundy option and the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> option?</p>
                        <p>4. What is the upper limit of our liability if we now go to 44
                            battalions?</p>
                        <p>5. Can we frame this program in such a way as to keep very clear our own
                            determination to keep the war limited? (This is another way of stating
                            question 4.)</p>
                        <p>6. Can we get a cold, hard look at the question whether the current
                            economic and military situation in Vietnam is so very bad that it may
                            come apart even before this program gets into action? (I don't believe
                            that it is that bad, but no one seems to be really sure of the facts
                            today.)</p>
                        <p>Friday's meeting<note n="3" xml:id="d43fn3">July 2; see <ref target="#d44">Document 44</ref>.</note> is not, repeat not, for
                            decisions, but for sharpening of the issues that you want studied.</p>

                        <p>At 11 a.m. on July 2, 1965, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> met in the Cabinet Room of the White House with

                            Bundy to discuss the four papers submitted to the President the day
                            before dealing with Vietnam policy (<ref target="#d38">Documents
                                38</ref>-<ref target="#d41">41</ref>). The meeting lasted 1 hour and
                            45 minutes. (Johnson Library, President's Daily Diary) No other
                            contemporary record of the meeting has been found, but <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> recalled the decisions
                            made by the President during the meeting:</p>
                        <p>“Like a Judge, the President expected to mull over the pleadings, and
                            gave no direct indication what his final decision would be. Instead, he
                            plucked ideas from each of the papers, and set them in motion. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Averell Harriman</persName> should travel at once
                            to Europe and set up the faint ‘cover’ of visiting Moscow on a
                            sightseeing trip. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            should go to Saigon in mid-July with General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> and with Cabot Lodge, now
                            picked as <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s successor, to
                            look over the situation and evaluate the military plans which <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> was already working to
                            project into 1966. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> should
                            work intensively to refine the negotiating possibilities, with a <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0151"/>particular eye to his latest
                            proposal of direct contact with the North Vietnamese representative in
                            Paris, and a secondary look at how contact with <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> representatives, through private Americans, might be

                        <p>1. In response to your memorandum of 1 July,<note n="2" xml:id="d45fn2">
                                <ref target="#d41">Document 41</ref>.</note> we agree that it would
                            be wise to inventory various modes and methods by which contact could be
                            made with or messages discreetly passed to the National Liberation Front
                                (<gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>) should we want to decide, now
                            or later, to take any such action. Our suggestions on this score are set
                            forth in the attached annex.<note n="3" xml:id="d45fn3">Entitled “Review
                                of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s Capabilities To Contact

                                printed.</note> The matter of passing the particular message
                            proposed in your 1 July memorandum is a bit more complex.</p>
                        <p>2. As we understand it, that memorandum suggests a contact or contacts
                            designed to do two things:</p>
                        <p>a. Elicit information about the strength of “southern” sentiment in the
                                <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> and “southern” concern over
                            growing Hanoi (i.e., “northern”) domination as the war in the south
                            expands;</p>
                        <p>b. Execute what we would call a covert action operation to plant a seed
                            (or seeds) of concern over the future fate of southerners in the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> movement if the war continues and
                            “Hanoi moves in absolutely to the driver's seat”.</p>
                        <p>3. There would certainly be no harm in trying to exert this kind of
                            covert psychological pressure, but we doubt if the particular operation
                                <pb n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0152"/>suggested would be very
                            fruitful. Hanoi—i.e., the leadership of the North Vietnamese Lao Dong
                            (Communist) Party—has been absolutely in the “driver's seat” ever since
                            it directed the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>'s creation in 1960.
                            It is highly unlikely that anyone has been posted abroad as an <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> representative who does not know this
                            and who is not quite willing to accept the fact of Lao Dong control.</p>
                        <p>4. As for the information elicitation, at best our cut-out(s) would be
                            unlikely to learn much more than the private sentiments of the
                            particular <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> representative(s)
                            contacted. Such information would be interesting, but not necessarily
                            representative. The views of <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> agents
                            abroad could easily be far out of phase with the sentiments of the cadre
                            actually waging war in South Vietnam. Furthermore, the chances of a
                            casual contact's achieving even this much are quite slight; for in
                            selecting the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>'s foreign
                            representatives, the Communist leadership would certainly make every
                            effort to screen out the kind of individual who would harbor dissident
                            sentiments or be prone to bare his innermost political feelings to
                            casual contacts. This information, of course, could best be obtained in
                            South Vietnam itself, either through agent assets or through a
                            manipulated contact.</p>
                        <p>5. A further point to bear in mind, and an absolutely crucial one, is the
                            extreme delicacy of any such operation. We would, of course, be
                            operating through third country cut-outs not themselves identifiable as
                            acting on behalf of the United States Government. If security broke down
                            in any phase of this operation, however, the results could be damaging.
                            If the Communists become aware of United States sponsorship of these
                            overtures, they themselves could use this fact to our political
                            detriment. If we sounded out the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in
                            advance about making any such overtures, the reaction of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s new leadership would almost certainly
                            be adverse and our very suggestions would raise grave doubts in their
                            minds about United States constancy and reliability. If we made such an
                            approach without advising the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            beforehand and the Communists should learn that these approaches were
                            United States sponsored, the Communists could do us serious political
                            damage with our Vietnamese allies in Saigon by ensuring that the latter
                            were made aware of the fact that the United States was dealing with the
                                <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> behind the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s back. At a minimum, if the Communists
                            realized that such overtures were of United States instigation, they
                            would probably discount these overtures' immediate substantive content
                            and construe the fact of the United States initiative in mounting them
                            as a sign that the United States was so anxious to disengage in Vietnam
                            that it was willing to soften its adamant stand on the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>. This, in our opinion, would be more
                            likely to encourage Hanoi with regard to the wisdom and eventual profit
                            of its present obdurate course than to induce any matching gestures of
                            conciliatory reasonableness.</p>
                        <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0153"/>
                        <p>6. In sum, though we certainly second the idea of canvassing our assets
                            now to determine how we might best be able to arrange discreet contact
                            with the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> should it ever become
                            desirable to do so, we do not believe that the likely advantages of the
                            particular approach outlined in your 1 July memorandum would be worth
                            the political risks they would unavoidably entail.</p>

                        <p>41. It may be that in coming weeks we will wish to establish some
                            indirect contacts, probably through cutouts, with <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> in order to get better reading than
                            provided by present random reports of Front's state of mind and
                            intentions. We have in mind particularly recurring suggestions that in
                            Front there is significant element of Sudiste thinking which, if
                            properly nurtured, might draw at least part of <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> away from Hanoi
                            domination toward some accommodation with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> on terms which not too unacceptable.</p>
                        <p>Realize such contact, no matter how carefully managed and covered, may be
                            leaked in such a way as to reach ears of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and raise with them acute worries about our intentions.
                            While we presume there are numbers of avenues by which certain <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials themselves maintain more or
                            less clandestine contact with Front, if it was learned that US
                            maintaining such contact there would be immediate assumption we were
                            looking for way out and intended to impose at least coalition government
                            on <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> if not scuttle <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> outright in favor of <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>. Therefore if leaks occur we would deny
                            categorically to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials and also
                            publicly if necessary that we have been in contact and contacts will of
                            course have to be managed in such manner that our denial credible.</p>
                        <pb n="122" xml:id="pg_122" facs="0154"/>
                        <p>Depending on what these contacts reveal and how over-all political
                            situation develops we may later conclude it advisable to bring <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> into picture to some degree. In that
                            case we will first wish to examine with you whether and how this can be
                            done so as to avoid precipitating sharp and perhaps decisive loss in
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> confidence in our
                            intentions.</p>
                        <p>In order get dialogue underway with <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>
                            and establish basis for efforts to alienate them from Hanoi we would
                            contemplate approaching indirectly those individuals who are accessible
                            and considered less enthusiastic about dependence on Hanoi and receptive
                            to Sudiste appeal. We envisage approach taking following line, being
                            conducted, of course, by someone who disclaims any official connection
                            and whose reference to official US views would be in terms of his
                            impression of thinking in Washington, to which he would claim to have
                            some access:</p>
                        <p>(1) You (<gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>) after years of fighting and privation are still getting
                            nowhere and widening daily the gulf between yourselves and your brothers
                            in the South.</p>
                        <p>(2) Since Hanoi persists in pressing always harder in its effort to take
                            over the South, using you in the process, and rejects all reasonable
                            efforts which US, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, many neutrals and
                            Afro-Asians and others have made to come to some peaceful settlement,
                            you face dismal prospect.</p>
                        <p>(3) Wonder to what extent we all find ourselves in this situation because
                            there may be real misunderstanding of why US in South Viet-Nam and what
                            it is seeking, or because we may not fully understand your true
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>(4) Contact welcomed to see if misunderstanding can be reduced or removed
                            for mutual benefit both our countries.</p>
                        <p>(5) Central aim US is simple: a neutral Viet-Nam which is dominated by no
                            outside power, whether from the North or elsewhere, and which can choose
                            its own government and policies through consultation with all of its
                            people.</p>
                        <p>(6) US seeks no alliances or bases in South Viet-Nam. Persuaded US means
                            to withdraw its forces the moment it becomes clear that efforts of North
                            Viet-Nam to dominate and dictate to the South are at an end.</p>
                        <p>(7) Do not believe you any more than we wish or consider it in your
                            interest to make South Viet-Nam more of a bloody battleground than it
                            already is or to be further used by the Northerners against your
                            brothers in the South who also seek peace for your country. Hope
                            therefore our contact can promote fruitful discussion.</p>
                        <p>Your comments on foregoing plan for approach to <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> urgently requested.</p>

                            months, in circumstances where it would not signal weakness, we may wish
                            to make quiet effort to establish contact also with <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> in order explore more actively
                            possibilities of some kind of negotiated settlement Vietnam situation.
                            In spite of several rebuffs we and others have received to more formal,
                            official overtures there have been indications that <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> might welcome opportunity to talk. This
                            might be worked out through official but quiet and confidential lower
                            level contact such as Mai Van Bo in Paris. It is possible though far
                            from certain that North Vietnamese might wish and be able in this way to
                            discuss position independent of Chinese. There may also be honest
                            misapprehension on <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> part as to what
                            is precisely our position on certain questions and direct dialogue might
                            serve to dispel such.</p>
                        <p>We would not be prepared to pay price of formal recognition of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> which Hanoi may very well demand. This
                            might, however, be a price we would be willing to pay for an acceptable
                            resolution of overall problem of Vietnam, but this would be a
                            possibility to be acknowledged only much later should it ever be
                            possible to get fruitful discussions underway.</p>
                        <p>As in case our possible contact with <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>,
                            we recognize <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would be immediately
                            suspicious and most uneasy if it becomes aware of our contact with
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. Nevertheless we presume that,
                            as Quat once hinted to us, contact with <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> not really so great political problem and we have after
                            all long since declared ourselves prepared to enter into discussions
                            with any government.</p>
                        <p>Therefore we believe that we should keep <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> informed if any contact established, reassuring them
                            that this being undertaken for purpose of making sure no avenue to
                            settlement left untried and that possibility of settlement not being
                            obstructed by misunderstanding which could be corrected; at same time we
                            have no intention negotiating behind their back any arrangements they
                            could not accept and we will keep in constant consultation with them.
                            Furthermore, they might wish to consider themselves possible utility of
                            their making contact independent of ours, in which case we would of
                            course also expect be kept informed.</p>
                        <p>For contact with <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> we envisage some
                            appropriate US official, depending upon locality, who could conduct
                            conversations inconspicuously. <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0156"/>On initial contact we would envisage he would follow line something
                            like following:</p>
                        <p>1. US has been deeply disappointed at negative responses from Hanoi to
                            numerous efforts made in recent months to explore peaceful means of
                            settling unhappy Vietnam situation.</p>
                        <p>2. US position remains unchanged in that we are determined to help South
                            Vietnam as long as this is necessary preserve that country's
                            independence. At same time we are ready without preconditions to discuss
                            ways of moving toward a peaceful settlement and bringing military
                            activity to an end.</p>
                        <p>3. We have said and we mean without qualification that we seek no bases
                            in South Vietnam and are prepared to withdraw our forces from that
                            country as soon as its continuing independent existence is assured. We
                            favor a neutral Vietnam. We have no designs whatsoever on North Vietnam
                            and no intention of trying to change its kind of government. We believe
                            the question of unification of the two parts of Vietnam is a matter for
                            the North and South to decide when each is in a position to make a free
                            decision; otherwise we take no position on whether Vietnam should be
                            unified or remain at least for some time divided.</p>
                        <p>4. We have noted the four points put forward by Premier Pham Van Dong on

                        <p>We regard all of these and other statements of objectives put forward
                            from other sources as worthy of our attention and suitable subjects for
                            discussion. Naturally we would not enter into discussion on any
                            understanding that the resulting conclusion would be fixed in advance
                            and would presume this would also be the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> position.</p>
                        <p>5. There are many elements in Premier Pham Van Dong's four points which
                            appear to be acceptable, assuming that further discussion would confirm
                            our understanding of what is intended. There are others which, if we
                            correctly interpret their purport, would in our view jeopardize the
                            independence of South Vietnam and therefore not be acceptable.</p>
                        <p>6. Thus we return again to our initial thought that free and open
                            discussion without preconditions might prove to be useful and we hope
                            that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would agree to undertake

                        <p>Since one of the critical variables in Vietnam is the attitude of the
                            Vietnamese toward U.S. troops, we have asked the Embassy in Saigon for a
                            careful review of the evidence on this point to date. That review is
                            coming next week, but in the meantime the mission has sent us a quick
                                assessment<note n="2" xml:id="d48fn2">Not further identified.
                            </note> whose summary judgment is interesting, as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. U.S. forces have drawn a variety of local reactions which, overall,
                            are moderate in tone and mildly favorable in content. Criticism
                            expressed so far deals with specific localized incidents rather than
                            broader questions of sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>2. There is general recognition of the military need for U.S. forces and
                            respect for their effectiveness and fire power. There is some
                            psychological letdown because U.S. forces have not quickly ended the
                            war, and on the other hand where U.S. forces are solidly emplaced, the
                            residents appear to be pleased with their improved physical security.
                            There have been local episodes of friction, but there have also been
                            reports of village opinion that U.S. troop behavior is better than that
                            of Vietnamese. Intensive Viet Cong propaganda against U.S. presence has
                            not been effective in secure areas, nor has there been any incident of a
                            situation which constitutes a significant hazard to U.S.-Vietnamese
                            cooperation or to effective prosecution of U.S. force missions.</p>
                        <p>3. The respect of one service for another probably makes this summary
                            slightly optimistic, but it remains important and encouraging.</p>

                            wrestling hard with the extent to which we should augment ground combat
                            forces between now and the end of the year. Understand <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> is filling you in on his
                            exchanges with <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>, which
                            indicate the program under consideration. We are especially concerned
                            with the question whether a 44 battalion force would mean taking over
                            the war to the extent that would diminish <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> performance
                            and perhaps at some point stimulate further Vietnamese popular
                            opposition. No attempt was made this week to resolve the issue and we
                            would welcome comment from you and Alex that would help us with our
                            thinking next week.</p>
                        <p>In view of far reaching decisions the President believes that it would be
                            useful to us all if <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            could visit Saigon starting about July 15 for five or six days.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> and someone from
                            Department would accompany.</p>
                        <p>As you know, President is deeply grateful for your willingness to stay on
                            for short period beyond your original commitment of last year but he
                            also feels a personal obligation to that commitment. He plans to name
                            Cabot Lodge as your successor and he could be in position to report for
                            duty about August 15. President is very eager that Lodge should
                            accompany <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> in order to
                            get fully and locally briefed before meeting Senate committee for
                            confirmation and to take part in decisions which he must largely carry

                        <p>If <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> should accompany
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> this again raises
                            question of when public announcement of your retirement and his
                            nomination should be made. In order to avoid slightest speculation that
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> visit led somehow
                            to your replacement there could be advantage in announcing change in
                            Ambassadorship when party leaves Washington for Saigon.</p>
                        <p>As you know, President has unlimited regard for the job you have done and
                            the sacrifices it has entailed on your part. I am quite sure that he
                            would wish to have your own reactions to the handling of the changeover
                            before pushing any buttons. Viet Nam situation is sufficiently special
                            to set aside normal practice in which one Ambassador in no way appears
                            until his predecessor has departed. But we also realize that handling of
                            South Vietnamese situation between public announcement and your
                            departure is of considerable importance. Please let me have your

                                <ref target="#d46">Documents 46</ref> and <ref target="#d47">47</ref>.</note> The following are Alex Johnson's and my
                            comments on plans for approach to <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> contained in reftels.</p>
                        <p>In a sentence, we are vigorously opposed to these proposed approaches
                            because (1) they are premature now or in any short term future; (2) they
                            are highly dangerous because of the effect on the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> of a leak, either fortuitous or
                            deliberate on the part of Communists; and (3) by our overeagerness to
                            negotiate, they will nullify our past and present efforts to convince
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> that we have the will and determination to turn the
                            tide against them sooner or later—so that they had better come to terms
                            sooner rather than later.</p>
                        <p>We are convinced that we are on a sound course now and should stay on it
                            without letting ourselves be diverted to untimely actions on either the
                            political or the military front. We are now engaged in the early phases
                            of the ascending military confrontation of the monsoon season. We are
                            taking losses and will take more; the same goes for the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. At the end of this season, it should be
                            our purpose to have so blunted and bloodied the monsoon offensive and to
                            have so punished the approved targets of our bombing in <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> can no longer hope
                            for a military victory and must admit it to themselves. If we can create
                            that picture and in addition one of readiness for a counter-offensive in
                            1966, we would then think Hanoi might be ready for useful contacts. But
                            it appears highly risky to seek shortcuts such as the reftels propose,
                            as they will encourage and stiffen the resistance of the enemy and, if
                            known, will be disastrous to our relations with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Apart from all the foregoing
                            considerations, this evidence of overeagerness to negotiate will tend to
                            defeat our purpose of leading Hanoi to the conference table if only
                            because the Communist leaders must necessarily oppose anything that we
                            are seeking.</p>
                        <p>With regard to specifics within the two proposals, we have further
                            comments which we would like to make if, in spite of the reasons set
                            forth above, it is decided to pursue one or both of these proposals.</p>

                        <p>58. For the President. This has been a relatively quiet week of
                            orientation and organization for the new government of Generals
                                <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>. We had our first substantive session
                            with its principal members at the joint US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> Council meeting on Friday where we had a useful
                            exchange of ideas on such subjects as desertion control, the
                            mobilization of paramilitary forces and the rice situation.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the latter, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has
                            established a central supply committee with full powers to deal with the
                            urgent logistical problems relating to the distribution of rice and
                            other commodities to population centers, generally to the north of
                            Saigon where shortages exist. In collaboration with our representatives,
                            the committee is developing requirements for commodity transport and
                            then arranging for the most efficient combination of coastal shipping,
                            airlift and escorted truck convoys. The distribution problem is becoming
                            increasingly difficult as the Viet Cong exert mounting pressure on
                            communications by road and inland waterways as a part of the monsoon
                            offensive.</p>
                        <p>In the course of this offensive, military action moved on at a slightly
                            increased tempo over last week with a high level of losses on both
                            sides. During the week ending July 3, our side lost 264 killed in action
                            as against 881 Viet Cong killed. It is hard to believe that the Viet
                            Cong can stand indefinitely the effect of such losses which, on our
                            side, have made combat ineffective roughly the equivalent of two
                            divisions. Government units in the II Corps have been particularly
                            chewed up and are going to need an injection of new vitality which can
                            only come from U.S. sources. I would expect General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> to seek early employment
                            of our troops in a strike role now that both the Marines and Airborne
                            Brigade have had time for acclimatization and experience in patrol
                            contacts with the Viet Cong. We shall watch very closely the effect of
                            U.S. forces committed to these first actions, expecting these early
                            experiences to help us form some judgment as to their effectiveness and
                            hence the extent of the requirement for additional U.S. ground
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>We had a short but pleasant visit from <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Eugene
                                Black</persName> and his party. Although the timing was not ideal
                            because of the newness of the government, nevertheless it allowed him
                            and his colleagues to form some impression of the Viet-Nam
                            situation.</p>
                        <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0162"/>
                        <p>Needless to say, we are looking forward to Bob McNamara's visit and the
                            opportunity to discuss directly with him the important problems which
                            lie ahead.</p>

                            to help bring about a conference on Viet-Nam; and</p>
                        <p>(b) Whether an effort should be made to get a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> peace force into Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>With regard to (b), there has not been, and there is not now, a remote

                            force into Viet-Nam except as a part of a settlement with the

                        <p>With regard to (a), I personally have discussed this further with Senator
                                <persName corresp="#p_MW1">Morse</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName>.</p>

                                Appointment Book)</note> and also was unaware of the information
                            which I could give him about the influences which we thought the
                            Russians were trying to exert to bring about some sort of negotiation or
                            discussion of Viet-Nam. He indicated that, at a recent dinner meeting
                            with Drew Pearson and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, the Ambassador had been asked point-blank what
                            the Soviet Union's attitude would be toward a Security Council call <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0163"/>for a conference of the Geneva
                            powers to take up the question of Southeast Asia. He reported that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had answered that
                            the Soviet attitude would depend upon prior talks between the U.S. and
                            the U.S.S.R. as well as on the manner of presentation to the Security
                            Council. Senator <persName corresp="#p_MW1">Morse</persName> seemed to
                            think that this left some opening.</p>
                        <p>As you know from my memorandum of conversation with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, I explored this with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> last Saturday.<note n="4" xml:id="d52fn4"> Rusk met with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> at 11 a.m. on July 3. A memorandum of the

                                July 4, is ibid., National Security File, Memos to the President,
                                McGeorge Bundy, Vol. XII.</note> He flatly denied having made any
                            such statement and reiterated that the Soviet Union did not think that
                            the Security Council was the proper forum to take up any such proposal.
                            We must anticipate, therefore, that the Soviet Union would not only
                            oppose such a Security Council resolution but would be cast in the
                            position of a harsh advocate of the Hanoi position. There is obvious
                            disadvantage in our forcing the Soviet Union into an even more extreme
                            position than they have taken, since we know there is still some
                            flexibility in the Soviet view of negotiation.</p>

                            you the following steps involving the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>:</p>
                        <p>(a) <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> will consult with U
                            Thant about the desirability of a Security Council resolution calling
                            for a conference of the Geneva powers; U Thant could then sound out the
                            Soviet Delegation and ascertain directly whether there is any
                            possibility of a Soviet abstention rather than a veto.</p>
                        <p>(b) We might well now present in writing to the members of the Security
                            Council a periodic report on events since February (the date of our last
                                report).<note n="6" xml:id="d52fn6">For text of this report, dated
                                February 7, see Department of State Bulletin, February 22, 1965, pp.
                                240-241.</note> In this way we could recapitulate the various
                            efforts which have been made to seek a peaceful settlement, their
                            rejection by the other side, and a summary of the situation as we see
                            it. There could be some value in a document of this sort which would be
                            circulated to all the members of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>(c) We would say to U Thant that if he wished himself, as Secretary
                            General, to call for a meeting of the Geneva powers, at which meeting
                            the question of a cessation of hostilities would be the first order of
                            business, <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0164"/>we would indicate our
                            readiness for such a conference. This would be entirely consistent with
                            our basic view that we are prepared for discussions without
                            conditions.</p>
                        <p>(d) We would also say to U Thant that we could see some advantage in his
                            undertaking any private exploration which he could make with Hanoi,
                            Peiping or Moscow to ascertain whether there are any openings for a
                            peaceful settlement. Such explorations might at least indicate that he
                            had been a possible channel if any of the parties had anything of
                            interest to say.<note n="7" xml:id="d52fn7">In telegram 41 to Geneva,
                                July 7, Rusk informed <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> (who was in Geneva for the meeting of the
                                U.N. Economic and Social Council) that he had sent these four
                                recommendations to the President for approval. (Department of State,

                                that he had talked that morning to U Thant, who said that the Soviet
                                Union was “out of the Viet Cong business” and Federenko had
                                instructions not to discuss the matter with him. <persName corresp="#p_TU1">Thant</persName> said that any suggestion for
                                negotiation hinged initially on U.S. acceptance of Viet Cong
                                representation. Thant indicated that he would transmit a message to
                                Hanoi proposing negotiations. Rusk responded to <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> that the United States
                                would not support such an initiative. (Ibid., Rusk Files: Lot 72 D

                        <p>On July 8, <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> reported, in
                            telegram 31 from Geneva, that in view of U.S. opposition, U Thant would
                            not put forward a negotiating formula that included the Viet Cong as a
                            separate party. In response to the possibilities outlined in telegram
                            41, <persName corresp="#p_TU1">Thant</persName> said that he would talk
                            with the Soviet delegation concerning a Security Council resolution
                            calling for a conference of the Geneva powers, but he anticipated that
                            the Soviets would insist on including the Viet Cong or would veto the
                            resolution. (Ibid., Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>

                        <p>1. I attach outgoing and incoming telegrams to Saigon<note n="2" xml:id="d53fn2">Attached were telegrams 41 and 42 to Saigon (<ref target="#d46">Documents 46</ref> and <ref target="#d47">47</ref>) and telegram 41 from Saigon (<ref target="#d50">Document

                            Cong and with Hanoi. The sum of their meaning is that <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and Johnson vigorously oppose
                            any informal approach to either the Viet Cong or Hanoi at this time.
                            They believe that such approaches are premature because of the tough
                            summer ahead. They think they are dangerous because of the effect of a
                            leak on the Saigon government. They think that overeagerness to
                            negotiate “will nullify our past and present efforts to convince the
                            Communists that we have the will and determination to turn the tide
                            against them sooner or later.”</p>
                        <p>2. This reaction was largely predictable, but its strength is somewhat
                            surprising. Moreover, conversations with <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> indicate to me that he has exactly the same
                            view.</p>

                            respected Catholic, the Embassy takes his view more seriously than other

                            divisions on his own, and the Embassy appears to be quite willing to
                            keep in touch with him. This may mark the bare beginning of contacts
                            among Vietnamese in the South that could be helpful.</p>

                        <p>B. Will large increases in the number and involvement of US combat units
                            and military personnel in South Vietnam cause the Vietnamese Government,
                            and especially the Army, to let up; will it create adverse popular

                        <p>1. How did you determine the number of US and <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> battalions required to effectively counter the current

                        <p>2. Where do you propose to station US combat units and where and how will
                            they be used; what casualties do you expect?</p>

                        <p>3. How long do you think it will take with your recommended forces (a) to
                            seize the initiative, (b) to prove to the Viet Cong that they cannot
                            win, and (c) thereby to force them to a settlement on our terms?</p>

                        <p>15. What measures do we have of the success or failure of our efforts to
                            prevent infiltration of men and equipment by sea; has the recently <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0168"/>expanded program reduced such
                            infiltration; if not, why not; are additional forces required?</p>
                        <p>16. Outline and appraise the effectiveness of alternative plans
                            (including a barrier across the 17th Parallel) for the use of US troops
                            in Laos for the purpose of preventing infiltration of men and equipment
                            through that country into South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>17. If you think it is possible militarily to cut off or very
                            substantially cut down the infiltration of North Vietnamese personnel
                            and materiel from the North to the South, when do you believe it will

                            activities and how decisive will that effect be?</p>

                        <p>19. Outline the original plan for the expansion of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military, paramilitary and police
                            forces; the progress to date against that plan; and changes, if any,

                        <p>21. How important is the monsoon to military operations and to the
                            military balance, and how should we expect military prospects to change

                        <p>23. After the deployment of the recommended US forces, how would the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> react to an extended pause (six
                            or eight weeks) in the bombing of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>?</p>
                        <p>24. Should we consider the imposition of press censorship after the

                        <p>25. What contacts do the South Vietnamese now have with the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>; what additional contacts would you recommend that they
                            or the US have with those parties or the Soviets; how should such US
                            contacts be initiated and with what notice to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>?</p>
                        <p>Assuming our party remains in Vietnam 4 or 5 days, certain members of the
                            party, including myself, probably should visit an aircraft carrier, the

                        <p>We hope it will be possible for us to avoid large ceremonial dinners.
                            Instead, we should like to dine with small numbers of Vietnamese, US or
                            third-country nationals in an atmosphere so informal that they will feel
                            free to provide us their personal comments on the Vietnamese scene.</p>
                        <p>Upon our return, we expect that important policy decisions will be made.
                            These may well require major legislative and executive action (including
                            possibly the declaration of a national emergency, the calling up of
                            reserve forces, large additions to the Budget, etc.) for which we wish
                            to be fully prepared.</p>

                                was a sub-panel of the President's Panel on Foreign Affairs, a
                                senior advisory group of former military leaders and statesmen
                                selected during the 1964 Presidential campaign. The group met for
                                the first time, at the President's request, on July 8 at 11 a.m. in
                                the Department of State to consider a variety of problems
                                confronting the administration. The group was divided for discussion
                                purposes into panels on Vietnam, Europe, and Latin America. The
                                Vietnam panel consisted of General Omar N. Bradley, John J. McCloy,
                                Roswell Gilpatric, Arthur Larson, and Dr. George Kistiakowsky.
                                According to <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName>,
                                the idea of convening the advisory panel developed in early June,
                                and the President approved the suggestion at the beginning of July.
                                The group received extensive briefing materials on July 7, met in
                                separate panels on the morning of July 8, and met again for a joint
                                discussion after lunch. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> met in the White House at 6:15 p.m. on July
                                8 with Dean Acheson, Arthur Dean, and Robert Lovett of the Europe
                                panel; John Cowles of the Latin America panel; and General Bradley
                                and McCloy of the Vietnam panel, and received the group's
                                recommendations. (Johnson Library, Papers of <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William P. Bundy</persName>, Ch. 27, p. 15)

                        <p>This group consisted of Messrs. Bradley, Gilpatric, Kistiakowsky, Larson,
                            and McCloy. It met with Secretary Rusk, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName>. The following are
                            highlights:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Stakes and Objectives in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The group, with the possible exception of Mr. Larson, felt that the
                            stakes were very high indeed. They concurred in the Administration <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0170"/>judgment that Thailand could
                            not be held if South Vietnam were taken over, and they thought that the
                            effects in Japan and India could be most serious. They particularly felt
                            that the effect in Europe might also be most serious, and that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> would find many takers for
                            his argument that the US could not now be counted on to defend
                            Europe.</p>
                        <p>They also felt that South Vietnam was a crucial test of the ability of
                            the free world and of the US to counter the Communist tactic of “wars of
                            national liberation,” and that a US defeat would necessarily lead to
                            worldwide questioning whether US commitments could be relied on.</p>
                        <p>It was the feeling of the group that these consequences would be
                            accentuated if the US by its own decision withdrew from South Vietnam,
                            of if the US suffered a military defeat there. On the other hand, the
                            group felt that the consequences would not be much reduced if a
                            Communist takeover took place as a result of a change in government in
                            Saigon, as a result of which the US was asked to leave.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Larson appeared to dissent from this assessment, in line with his
                            over-all view that we should be seeking <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action or serious negotiations (see para 4 below).</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Increase of Combat Forces in South Vietnam</p>
                        <p>In line with their view of the grave stakes, the group generally felt
                            that there should be no question of making whatever combat force
                            increases were required. Several members of the group thought that our
                            actions to date had perhaps been too restrained, and had been
                            misconstrued by Hanoi that we were less than wholly determined.</p>
                        <p>The group urged that, in connection with any decisions for further
                            increases, there should be a full spelling out of the military situation
                            and the facts making the increases necessary.</p>
                        <p>One or two members of the group asked whether it was possible to
                            undertake the closing of the South Vietnamese border as a military
                            operation. They appeared, however, to accept Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s statement that this would
                            be a very fast, major operation of uncertain effect, and that the job
                            had to be done within South Vietnam, including the possibility of major
                            forces in the plateau area—although this currently did not seem wise
                            because of the fact that the main operation route (Route 19) was cut in
                            several places and would have to be fully defended before forces could
                            be sustained in the plateau other than by air supply.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. The Policy on Bombing of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secretary Rusk and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>, laid out the various factors—particularly the
                            question of Soviet reaction—that had led us not to hit Hanoi and
                            Haiphong. The consultants appeared to accept these points, and none
                            pressed for any early change in this policy. However, General Bradley
                            did raise the question <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0171"/>whether
                            we might not conduct individual raids on Hanoi and Haiphong in reprisal
                            for specific outrages in the South. It was noted that this should not be
                            done for outrages confined to Americans—but noted equally that most
                            outrages were not likely to be of this character.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Negotiating and International Actions</p>
                        <p>There was much discussion whether it would be useful to take the South
                            Vietnam issue to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Mr. Larson
                            argued at length for this course, but much of his discussion related to
                            whether it should have been done in 1961 before we went into the
                            advisory build-up. At the present time, Mr. Larson said that his
                            soundings indicated that there would be much support in the United
                            Nations for a simple call for the convening of a Geneva Conference.
                            Others doubted whether there would not be hookers such as a demand for
                            the cessation of bombing. Mr. Larson himself did not see much use in
                            convening the Geneva Conference, and appeared to have in mind that the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> itself might act to introduce
                            forces or police a cease-fire. Others doubted very strongly that either
                            of these was either practical or useful, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> and Mr. Dean were vehement on
                            the subject in the later plenary session. (Mr. Dean said that this was
                            no time to “turn over our Far East policy to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.”)</p>
                        <p>Mr. Larson's basic underlying view appeared to be grave doubt that we
                            would get a truly viable and democratic Vietnam even by causing Hanoi to
                            pull out, and he repeatedly queried whether what we might get as a
                            “success” would be that much better than what we might get now. Dr.
                            Kistiakowsky suggested that the real difficulty might be the difference
                            between a South Vietnam in which individuals now in the Viet Cong were
                            free to engage in political activity—which would certainly have its
                            difficulties—and a South Vietnam in which the Communist Viet Cong had
                            become a part of a coalition government and were highly likely to take
                            over. The matter was not really developed in detail, but it was clear
                            that the group thought we needed to look hard at just what we did expect
                            to come out in South Vietnam—and equally clear that none of the other
                            members of the group were prepared to buy Mr. Larson's basic thesis.</p>
                        <p>As to going to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, it should be noted
                            that several members of the group, while clearly opposing Mr. Larson's
                            line, thought that it might be useful at some time—perhaps in the
                            context of increased military commitments—to do this, in order to make
                            clear again that we were ready for negotiations. But the general feeling
                            was that such a move at the present time would not be useful and would
                            be a dangerous sign of weakness. (General Bradley particularly stressed
                            this point.)</p>
                        <p>In the plenary session, Mr. Hoffman (who, like Mr. Larson, had apparently
                            been having extensive personal contacts in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> corridors) more or less backed Mr. Larson's thesis in
                            favor of an early move in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He
                            thought it was essential to persuade the Afro-Asian countries we <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140" facs="0172"/>were not acting as
                            imperialists, and that many of them did have this view. He specifically
                            suggested a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> call for talks which would
                            include the two Vietnams, the US/<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>/France/Communist
                            China, but also the Liberation Front. The plenary session did not pursue
                            the question of dealing with the Liberation Front, but the matter had
                            been raised in the Panel, and the Panel members appeared to accept
                            Secretary Rusk's statement of the many strong reasons why this would be
                            unwise and unproductive in terms of real negotiations, and seriously
                            damaging to the whole view of the war on which our actions were
                            based.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">5. Prognosis of the Situation</p>
                        <p>Mr. McCloy spoke at some length—both in the Panel and in the later
                            plenary session—on the degree to which he had been impressed during the
                            discussion with the toughness of the situation. He thought that it was
                            most unlikely that merely blunting the monsoon offensive would bring
                            Hanoi to a negotiating mood, and that the situation would probably
                            remain critical for a long time. He was particularly concerned that the
                            Soviets might be brought increasingly to what he called an “annealing”
                            of the Sino-Soviet relationship, i.e., the Soviets competing with the
                                <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s and acting on parallel
                            lines, although with no necessary resolution of the basic policy
                            differences between them.</p>
                        <p>While others did not express themselves at length on this question, it
                            seemed clear that Mr. McCloy's views had many takers both in the Panel
                            and in the plenary session.</p>
                        <p>In the plenary session, Mr. Dean said that he thought there was a great
                            deal of sentiment in the country for doing whatever it took, if we were
                            going to go on at all. Mr. Lovett made the point that it was not useful
                            to talk about “victory”, that what was really involved was preventing
                            the expansion of Communism by force; in a sense, avoiding defeat. This
                            view seemed to be generally shared.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">6. Specific Suggestions</p>
                        <p>The importance of local intelligence was particularly stressed by General
                            Bradley, including the importance of Americans throughout the
                            countryside.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McCloy and others stressed the great importance of the closest
                            possible contact with our allies, and wondered if more could not be done
                            particularly with the British, and, he thought, the Germans.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Larson thought that it would be useful for the government,
                            particularly as it took further decisions, to spell out a number of
                            points that had been bothering the public. He specifically mentioned the
                            legal justification for bombing in the North.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cowles thought that government sources had consistently painted too
                            rosy a picture of the situation, and Mr. Lovett joined in this view.</p>
                        <pb n="141" xml:id="pg_141" facs="0173"/>
                        <p>Mr. Cowles thought that one highly popular move in South Vietnam might be
                            for the government to abolish taxes, with the US making up the deficit
                            through increased economic aid.</p>

                            missions and recommendations for new guidelines.</p>
                        <p>1. Evaluation. Rand Corporation has prepared preliminary report (being
                                pouched)<note n="2" xml:id="d56fn2">Not found. </note> of
                            impressions of interviews with 33 <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            captives and defectors who had experienced or observed effects of
                            defoliation and crop destruction. Report states that spray operations
                            have successfully destroyed crops grown by <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> production units, further reducing already scarce food
                            supply for <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> combat units and forcing
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to seek food elsewhere. On the
                            other hand, report states that spraying of crops belonging to civilians
                            and popular belief that sprays are harmful to humans have had
                            “significant adverse effect” on population's attitude toward <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and US.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>, however, points out that Rand
                            findings are based on comparatively small sampling and that other
                            intelligence sources do not support conclusion that adverse effect of
                            chemical crop destruction has been sufficiently extensive to be
                            described as significant. <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> also
                            points out that Rand findings do not reflect procedures instituted
                            recently to assure that psywar operations planned in connection with
                            herbicide operations are in fact carried out.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> has drafted evaluation of crop
                            destruction in three major <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> areas since
                            July 1964, which will be pouched as soon as staffing completed.
                            According to <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> evaluation, Binh
                            Thuan operation (summer 1964) destroyed 80 percent of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> crops in area, forcing <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> into open to steal or purchase food.
                            Psywar program drew 252 people out of an area in which previous psywar
                            efforts had been singularly unsuccessful. Psywar <pb n="142" xml:id="pg_142" facs="0174"/>teams successfully demonstrated to
                            population that <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> had failed to live up
                            to their promises of protection.</p>
                        <p>Phuoc Long and Phuoc Thanh operation (October 1964) destroyed 3085
                            hectares of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> crops. There was confusion
                            and lowering of morale among <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and
                            supporters following spraying, and reduction in <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> ability to conduct operations. Fact that only three
                            hundred people were resettled from a much larger number of potential
                            refugees attributed to lack of more aggressive psywar program.</p>
                        <p>Binh Dinh operation (April-May 1965) destroyed 3145 hectares of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> crops. Three hundred sixty people have
                            been resettled, and many more are dissatisfied but forcibly detained by
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, creating definite anti-<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> feeling in area. This is substantiated by
                            reported murder of two <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> cadre by
                            villagers.</p>
                        <p>Available information, which thus far continues to be scanty, indicates
                            following:</p>
                        <p>1. Chemical crop destruction has caused hardship to <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have attempted with limited success
                            to turn peasant fear of unknown chemicals and loss of food against
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. But Rand report found no
                            evidence population has joined <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> because
                            of herbicide operations.</p>
                        <p>3. When <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> experience food shortage,
                            initial reaction is to make greater food demands on population, who
                            therefore frequently bear brunt of loss. But even if <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> succeed in this objective, it
                            necessitates (a) creating ill will among peasant population through
                            seizing and taxing methods; (b) diversion of increased percentage of
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> manpower from military activity to
                            food production; (c) in some cases movement of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> units into open area in search of food, making them more
                            vulnerable to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> action and decreasing
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> offensive capability. Rand and
                                <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> estimate one-third to one-half
                            of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> manpower devoted to food
                            production.</p>
                        <p>Mission has come to recommendations below based on these findings and
                            following considerations:</p>
                        <p>1. Conditions of war are hardening. Areas tightly controlled by <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> pose dilemma for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces which are faced with alternatives of (a)
                            abandoning area and its population; (b) striking with aerial bombardment
                            and strafing; (c) undertaking ground operations supported by air strikes
                            and artillery; or (d) destroying food and thus starving <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and population out. Viewed in this
                            context, Mission considers chemical crop destruction poses comparatively
                            less risk to civilian population in area.</p>
                        <p>2. To be truly effective, operations must destroy all food in fairly
                            extensive area.</p>
                        <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0175"/>
                        <p>3. Most effective areas for crop destruction are now northern and central
                            highlands, which are among most critical areas of expected <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> summer offensive.</p>
                        <p>4. There will undoubtedly be some resentment on part of population whose
                            crops are destroyed. It is therefore crucial that this resentment be
                            directed against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> rather than <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Rand evidence indicates need still

                        </list>
                        <p>1. (TS) US/<gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> air activity against North
                            Vietnam during June 1965 increased by approximately one-third over that
                            performed during May. During June, 86 strikes were made against <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>-designated and special targets. Of
                            these, 78 strikes were flown by US aircraft and eight <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0176"/>jointly flow by US/<gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> aircraft. In addition, 69 armed
                            reconnaissance missions were flown against <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>s, targets of opportunity, and coastal shipping.</p>
                        <p>2. (TS) During the reporting period, <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>s reacted to the presence of our
                            aircraft over North Vietnam on two occasions, both actions resulting in
                            air combat engagements. The first engagement occurred about 45 nm south
                            of Hanoi on 17 June between two Navy F4B Phantom II jet fighters on
                            barrier cap patrol over Thanh Hoa Bridge and Yen Phu Barracks and four
                                <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>s in loose trail formation. The
                            release of a Sparrow AAM from each F4B exploded two of the four <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>s. VHF intercept indicates a third
                                <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss> may have been destroyed.
                            Available data indicates the <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>s were
                            engaged in routine training at time of encounter, however, when visual
                            contact was made the <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>s changed
                            heading to collision course with the US fighters. The fourth <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss> was observed making direct landing
                            approach to Phuc Yen. In contrast, the second occurrence on 20 June,
                            supported by sequence of events, indicates a deliberate enemy
                            interception effort by two <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>-17/FRESCOs against four <gloss target="#t_A1H1">A1H</gloss>
                            Navy aircraft while providing air cover on <gloss target="#t_SAR1">SAR</gloss> operation for a downed <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> F4C earlier involved in air attack against Son La
                            Barracks 100 nm west northwest of Hanoi. During an approximate five
                            minute engagement, the <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>s fired
                            unguided rockets at extreme range which burned out before reaching the
                            <gloss target="#t_A1H1">A1H</gloss>s. One <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss> was hit and exploded upon crashing. In other activity,
                            enemy reaction has been limited to frequent, intense antiaircraft fire.
                            US losses for the month were 14 aircraft. No <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> aircraft were lost in June. As of 30 June 1965, 55 US
                            aircraft were lost in air actions against North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>3. (TS/NFD) Our air strikes have increased the time required for traffic
                            movements from Hanoi south and have reduced the capacity and flexibility
                            of the national transport system. Motor transportation and coastal
                            shipping requirements have greatly increased. There are some indications
                            that concentration on internal needs has reduced the level of logistic
                            support to the Pathet Lao. The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> has
                            demonstrated the capability to infiltrate supplies to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> from the Haiphong area by sea. Movement
                            of military supplies overland and across water obstacles, especially
                            Route 1A, with the advent of the monsoon season will become increasingly
                            difficult and may block routes into Laos. However, it is felt that the
                            capability of the <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> to perform its
                            mission of (1) defense of homeland, (2) to provide training for its own
                            forces and for infiltration forces for <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and Laos, and (3) to provide logistic support for its
                            own forces and the Communist forces of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and Laos at the present level of activity has not been
                            effected to any appreciable degree. The reduction of road capacity due
                            to attacks of <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> targets in the
                            southern part of the country has however limited the ability of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to support any major offensive beyond
                            its own borders into Laos or <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>4. (S) The economic effects of the air strikes have been minor in
                            relation to total economic activity of North Vietnam. The combined
                            effects of transportation difficulties, loss of electric power, and
                            disruption caused by actual or anticipated air strikes have probably
                            reduced the rate of total output of the GNP by only a few percentage
                            points. The volume of freight carried on the Thanh Hoa-Vinh rail lines
                            was on the order of 440 short tons each way per day, or less than five
                            percent of the total tonnage carried by the entire railroad system of
                            North Vietnam. Three electric power plants, comprising about nine
                            percent of total national generating capacity, have been rendered
                            inoperable and will probably require at least 12-18 months for
                            restoration. Viewed from the outside, the economic effects of the air
                            strikes do not seem to amount to much. However, Hanoi probably has a
                            different view. The damaged and destroyed bridges and power plants
                            represent years of construction work which was made possible only with
                            foreign assistance. Costs of reconstruction of the bridges, power
                            plants, and POL storage facilities will represent about four percent of
                            total annual investment. However, the country is barely self-sufficient
                            in food, industrial output is small, and there are ambitious plans for
                            economic expansion. There are strains in all elements of the economy and
                            any disruptions add to the serious problems faced by the regime.</p>
                        <p>5. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/LD/NFD) Assessment of the effect of
                            our air activity on the attitudes of the North Vietnamese Government and
                            people is based on reports received by Free World sources and from
                            statements made by <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> officials and
                            citizens. From an analysis of available evidence there is nothing to
                            indicate definitely that the bombings have caused either physical damage
                            or lowered morale to an extent that would compel the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to negotiate. The bombings may be
                            factors in some reports that the North Vietnamese Government is perhaps
                            slightly more willing to discuss a settlement. It might be conjectured,
                            however, that a concern for preventing escalation of hostilities is
                            another factor—and a strong one in the case of the Soviet Bloc pressure
                            that is manifested in reported conversations in various parts of the
                            world. Postal intercepts indicate that despite some economic upset,
                            destruction, and suffering, there is a spirit of resistance to the air
                            strikes.</p>
                        <p>6. (TS/NFD) In summary, the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> still
                            seems ready to endure further air strikes. <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> logistic support problems in southern North Vietnam
                            have increased and further reduction of an ability to support external
                            overt aggression has taken place. However, the strikes have not yet
                            reduced <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> over-all military
                            capabilities to train and support covert infiltration to South Vietnam.
                            Preoccupation with their own internal defense, however, has affected the
                            level of their logistic support to the Pathet Lao. Similarly, expanded
                            civil defense duties, if prolonged, may prevent achievement of
                            agricultural production goals—a problem of <pb n="146" xml:id="pg_146" facs="0178"/>chronic concern in North Vietnam. Nevertheless, the
                            regime at this point appears determined to persevere in its present
                            course of action.</p>

                        <p>The new Soviet-<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> economic and military
                            aid agreement implies a stepup in Soviet arms shipments and will have
                            the effect of deepening the Soviet commitment in Vietnam. Partly in
                            order to contain the risks of this commitment, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has of late intensified private
                            approaches to the US, indicating continued interest in a negotiated
                            settlement. At the same time, it has threatened in low key to make
                            trouble in Berlin if the US remains unyielding in Vietnam. We believe
                            that this combination of tactics is intended to deter further US
                            escalation in Vietnam. It is also meant to prepare for the time when
                            negotiations might become feasible, and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> can play a larger role in Vietnam.</p>

                                from Moscow, July 15. McGeorge Bundy forwarded the telegram to the
                                President on July 15, under cover of a memorandum in which he noted
                                that what was striking about the conversation was the routine
                                character of <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s
                                comments, including a standard exchange on Vietnam. A notation on
                                Bundy's covering memorandum indicates that the President saw it.

                        <p>[Here follows discussion unrelated to Vietnam.]</p>
                        <p>Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> asked whether the
                            U.S. seriously believed, “speaking in human terms between ourselves,”
                            that there is a real legal government in South Vietnam. He said he could
                            not conceive of this. “You just can't believe this,” he said. “Yet the
                            U.S., for this so-called government, sheds the blood of its own soldiers
                            and kills defenseless Vietnamese.”</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> reported that he
                            did not want to dodge that question but that he wished at that point to
                            put another question on the table. Does the Soviet Union really believe,
                            he asked, that without the support and direction of the North Vietnamese
                            there would be a serious situation today in South Vietnam?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> stated that he would
                            answer Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s
                            question. He said he was thoroughly familiar with Vietnam and knew that
                            the South Vietnamese would fight with bamboo sticks, if necessary,
                            against the current regime there. A rotten regime cannot last, he said,
                            and he offered to cite many examples from Russian history to prove his
                            point. This happened in 1905 and 1917 in Russia and is about to happen
                            in Vietnam, he said.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> noted that the
                            Vietnam situation was, of course, a major difference between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and U.S. which see this problem
                            differently. He noted that agreement had been reached on Laos between
                            President Kennedy and Premier Khrushchev during their Vienna meeting. He
                            stated that he came here twice in 1963 to try and persuade the Soviet
                            Government that the North Vietnamese were violating <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0180"/>the 1962 Geneva Agreement by sending
                            people and arms to Laos. Khrushchev, however, did not want to talk about
                            this and only stated that the Soviets were adhering to the Agreement and
                            that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> did not have any other
                            responsibility in the matter. We are regretful, the Governor stated,
                            that the Soviet Union, as co-chairman, did not take a hand in stopping
                            this violation of the Agreement. In Vietnam we are absolutely certain
                            that the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> is aided, abetted and
                            directed by Hanoi, he said. There is no evidence whatsoever that the
                                <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> movement is really an indigenous
                            uprising, or that the people of South Vietnam want to be taken over by
                            North Vietnam. We have an expression in English, “voting with your
                            feet.” One million people left North Vietnam to go to South Vietnam in
                            1954, the Governor said. Furthermore, hundreds of thousands of South
                            Vietnamese have left their homes in Viet Cong-dominated areas. It is
                            true that it has been difficult to obtain political agreement in South
                            Vietnam because of internal frictions, largely between the Catholics and
                            the Buddhists. (As this last phrase was being translated into Russian
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> laughed and said
                            “this cannot be serious”.) However, the Governor stated, not one of the
                            rival groups in South Vietnam stands for surrender to the North. We
                            believe firmly that the majority of people in South Vietnam want to
                            remain independent and do not wish to be taken over by the <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh clique</persName>. The President has
                            stated that we are in favor of elections there once the war is over. The
                            very fact that there have been so many changes of government in Saigon
                            is evidence that we are not imposing our will on the Vietnamese people.
                            It is the people of Vietnam who must decide the future of their own
                            government.</p>
                        <p>At this point <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> laughed
                            again and said directly to Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>, “You don't believe what you are saying.”</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> quickly replied
                            that Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had hit on
                            exactly the reason for his presence in Moscow and that the Premier's
                            reaction had been expressed so naturally that Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> had to believe that it was a
                            sincere reaction. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> stressed that what he had just been saying is
                            the real belief of the President, his advisors, Congress, and the
                            American people. The <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                            Administration, he said, had made a commitment to Vietnam in 1954 and
                            all successive U.S. administrations had carried through this commitment.
                            What the U.S. is doing is in response to escalation from North Vietnam.
                            We believe, Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>
                            said, in strict adherence to the 1954 Geneva Agreement and we had
                            adhered to it scrupulously. But starting in 1959 and 1960 terrorism
                            organized by the North Vietnamese had disrupted a country which had been
                            making great strides forward economically. This terrorist action and
                            guerrilla warfare were in accordance with the theories of Mao Tse-tung.
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> stated that it
                            is important for <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> to
                            understand that we are not mistaken in our assessment <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0181"/>of the situation in South Vietnam.
                            During the past 3-1/2 years we have captured many prisoners and
                            interrogated them. The weight of the evidence is overwhelming that on
                            the orders of Hanoi the terrorism in South Vietnam has been started,
                            dormant Communist cells had been reactivated and more and more people
                            had been sent to the South from North Vietnam. Now, regular units of the
                            North Vietnamese army had been dispatched to the South. The North
                            Vietnamese seem to believe that they can win by force. However,
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> has stated that
                            the honor of the U.S. is involved in this struggle. We deeply believe
                            that we have proof beyond question that the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> is not a spontaneous liberation movement and that it
                            would collapse if it were not supported by Hanoi. If the Soviet Union is
                            so sure that we are wrong, the Governor stated, then why not accept
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s proposal and
                            discuss the situation. We could discuss the possibility for future
                            elections in Vietnam, he said. While this was not a proposal, it would
                            certainly be a topic which could be discussed at some possible future
                            conference.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> stated that he was not
                            authorized to negotiate on the question of Vietnam. However, he said,
                            since Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> had
                            touched upon this matter, he would speak his mind frankly. He said that
                            he was profoundly convinced that Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> did not believe what he had just said. The
                            information presented was completely at variance with reality. The U.S.
                            knows that there is no duly constituted government in South Vietnam, he
                            said. There is only a clique of military men paid by the U.S. which
                            kills Catholics and Buddhists alike. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> then cited desertions from the South Vietnamese
                            army as perhaps another example of “voting with one's feet.” Our
                            information is good, he said. If the Vietnamese people were given a real
                            chance to vote, the Saigon clique would be thrown out. He had been to
                            Vietnam, he said, and talked to people there he trusted 100% and he
                            believed them. How can the U.S. say that it is helping the South
                            Vietnamese? he asked. “This is a monstrous statement. You are killing
                            South Vietnamese. History will never forgive the U.S. for this crime.
                            This will always be a blot on the U.S.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> stated that he would like
                            to offer for consideration one aspect of the Vietnam situation which he
                            had been thinking about. He stated that, as the U.S. knew, differences
                            exist in the international communist movement on questions of war and
                            peace between the Chinese and the Soviets. The U.S. was now doing all it
                            could to prove the Chinese right and the Soviets wrong on this question.
                            “You follow pro-Chinese policies,” he said. You are responsible for
                            tensions in the area and the peoples of the East are turning against
                            you. You only have your puppets there and by your actions and resistance
                            to national liberation movements you only prove the Chinese point that
                            war is inevitable. This is my personal view, he cautioned, and not for
                            the press. He went on to state that the U.S. was trying to prove that
                            war is inevitable whenever national <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150" facs="0182"/>liberation movements arise. You are thereby, he said,
                            taking the view of those you profess to fight. You are taking a
                            pro-Chinese stand.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> stated that
                            although the Premier's words were harsh, he appreciated his speaking
                            what was on his mind. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said that we have to speak frankly and openly
                            in order to move forward in solving the problems which confront us.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> replied that he had never
                            said this to anyone else and he hoped Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> would communicate his thoughts
                            to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> stated that
                            without sincerity we cannot solve the problems that face us and he
                            assured Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> that he
                            was utterly convinced that what he had told him was the truth.</p>
                        <p>Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> stated that if he
                            had the time he was sure that he could convince Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> that his own assessment of the
                            Vietnam situation was the correct one. You may be convinced of what you
                            say, he said. “If so, your convictions are completely erroneous, 100%
                            erroneous. There are many disparate forces in South Vietnam, but by your
                            own cruelty, by your barbarism you are uniting the people of Vietnam
                            against you. If I were a Vietnamese, I myself would grab a stick and
                            start to fight against you. By your actions, he said, you are helping
                            those who favor war in the world.” Indicating another engagement, he
                            then stated he would like to bring the talk to a conclusion and asked
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> whether he
                            could offer any new hypothesis or proposal (1) to reduce tensions in the
                            world, or (2) to improve relations between the U.S. and USSR. “Or do you
                            have nothing to offer?” he asked.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> stated that
                            Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had put him in a
                            difficult position by asserting that the President is wrong. Chairman
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had to acknowledge
                            first of all, he stated, that the President is sincere. You say you have
                            been in Vietnam and know the situation there, but you have been
                            deceived, the Governor said. You must accept the President's sincerity,
                            he said, adding that he did not question Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s sincerity even though he knew
                            him to be wrong.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> replied that he had not
                            been deceived by anyone. “That is impossible.” There are other sources
                            of information than the U.S. is aware of. Your crude (gruby) actions
                            have not only united the Vietnamese against you but will cause events in
                            Vietnam to be repeated throughout Southeast Asia. Talks such as this, he
                            said, will not solve the question. It will be solved, sooner or later by
                            the people of Vietnam themselves. You cannot win by buying governments.
                            He stated he could buy “these puppets of yours” tomorrow for one million
                            dollars. And it is for these marionettes that you sacrifice the people
                            of Vietnam and your own people as well, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> stated that he
                            had come here in good faith and not to be abused. He recalled that when
                            he was Ambassador here during <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0183"/>the war, Marshal Stalin once told him that he accepted his sincerity
                            because Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> had
                            come to the Soviet Union in the 20's in order to help the Soviet people.
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> reminded
                            Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> that he had had
                            long experience with the leaders of the Soviet Union over the years and
                            that nobody until now had questioned his good faith. He stated that he
                            himself was not important. However, he vigorously stated that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> must believe that the President
                            is completely sincere and has no intention of allowing <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName>, supported by the Chinese,
                            to take over South Vietnam. We had faced a similar situation in Korea,
                            the Governor stated, and did not flinch there. Our actions in Vietnam
                            are based on what we believe to be incontrovertible evidence. The
                            President is also absolutely sincere, he said, in wanting to go to the
                            conference table. This, however, should not be interpreted as weakness.
                            We must perhaps wait for Hanoi to realize that it cannot succeed in its
                            efforts. Once Hanoi realizes this, the Governor said, perhaps we can
                            then have a conference and come to some arrangement whereby the problem
                            could be settled. In view of the Soviet dispute with Peiping, he said,
                            he would have thought that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            would not favor the use of force as a means for the settlement of
                            problems in the Far East. He assured <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> that the U.S. will not stand by and see country
                            after country fall under Peiping's heel. He denied that those who
                            supported the U.S. position in the Far East are “puppets”, and asserted
                            that many peoples in the Far East sincerely support us. The U.S. fought
                            a bloody war with Japan in order to stop that country from taking over
                            that area and it will not stand by and let China accomplish what Japan
                            could not. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>
                            pointed out that we have great experience in the area and are well
                            acquainted with the forces which are at work there. The way to reduce
                            tension between the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> he
                            said, was perhaps exemplified by India where both countries worked
                            together to strengthen India's capacity to resist Peiping's aggression.
                            But the first step in reducing tension is for the Soviet leaders to
                            accept the sincerity and determination of the President, he said.
                            Without that, there is little left to talk about.</p>
                        <p>Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> was asking him to
                            support President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> but
                            that this completely contradicts the Soviet view of the problem and
                            would be impossible for any humanist. Such an action could not be
                            justified, he said. He stated that the Soviet people approve the actions
                            which the Soviet Government has taken to support the Vietnamese and he
                            was convinced that many American people do not support U.S. Government
                            policy in Vietnam. He said that the U.S. pilots who destroy defenseless
                            villages could not be considered heroes. No one could believe this, he
                            said. “It would go against the grain of any humanist, any
                            communist.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> stated that when he had
                            expounded his views, Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> had interpreted them as somewhat insulting. He
                            said that <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152" facs="0184"/>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> had referred to the fact that
                            Stalin had valued his personal integrity. He stated that he had given
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> no cause for
                            personal pique and had not meant to impugn his integrity. He added that
                            he had been Deputy Premier during the war and knew how sharply Stalin
                            could speak. The Soviet Union stands firmly for peaceful coexistence, he
                            said. This view is shared by all Soviet leaders. The Soviets will
                            continue this policy and will not embark on any military adventures. It
                            was for this reason, he stated, that he had asked Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> whether the U.S. could offer
                            any hypothesis to improve bilateral relations or to settle the Vietnam
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> pointed out that
                            discussions of the Vietnam situation were one possibility. Since the
                            Soviet Union was co-chairman, he said, it should be thinking of finding
                            ways to bring about negotiations. He emphatically stressed that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had the support
                            of his advisors, of Congress and of the American people in pursuing his
                            Vietnam policy. According to the latest public opinion polls in the
                            U.S., 70% of the people supported the President. He added that he had
                            never suggested that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was in
                            any way responsible for the acts of Hanoi and certainly not for those of
                            Peiping.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that the U.S. should
                            not think that a peaceful initiative in Vietnam would be regarded as
                            weakness. The French settlement of the Algerian war had been a sign of
                            strength. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> added that the
                            U.S. would be making a mistake in equating Peking and Hanoi. He himself,
                            he said, had talked to the Vietnamese leaders and knew that they do not
                            rule out a possible political settlement. “You must find a way, an
                            approach, to bring this about.” He said that he had known <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> for more than thirty years
                            and he could assure Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho</persName>
                            is a heroic representative of the Vietnamese people, who love and admire
                            him. The only way out in Vietnam is for the U.S. to start talks with the
                            Vietnamese themselves and find a solution for this affair. What else is
                            there? Fighting in Vietnam for many years to come will not help that
                            country. He reiterated that a peaceful initiative in Vietnam would never
                            be considered by the Soviet Union to be a sign of weakness and that the
                            prestige of the U.S. would not sink if peaceful initiatives were
                            undertaken.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> replied that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> is ready and
                            anxious for talks but that thus far Hanoi had shown no interest in them.
                            If this was <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s suggestion,
                            he said, then the U.S. will certainly follow it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> replied that “waiting is
                            all right, but people with the noise of bombs in their ears are not
                            anxious to negotiate.”</p>

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName> welcomed Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and his party.
                                <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName> said after three
                            weeks of its existence the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has
                            perhaps not succeeded in producing spectacular results; however, by the
                            firm stand the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has taken, the
                            religious and political groups appear to endorse <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0186"/>the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            program and are quiescent.<note n="2" xml:id="d60fn2">In telegram 164
                                from Saigon, July 16, the Embassy reported that Buddhist leader
                                    <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> had informed the
                                Embassy that he could not support the <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> government and was considering what course of
                                action to take. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 15 VIET
                                    <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The Department responded, in
                                telegram 166 to Saigon, July 17, with concern that Quang's attitude
                                might presage renewed Buddhist unrest, and instructed the Embassy to
                                call on Quang and inform him that additional political turmoil in
                                Saigon could only serve to aid the Viet Cong and undermine the will
                                of the South Vietnamese to resist the Communists. (Ibid.)</note> The
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had first sought to make clear
                            to the people that the new government would be resolute in prosecuting
                            the war, in winning ultimate victory over the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, and in bringing peace with freedom to South Viet-Nam.
                            Secondly, the new government is attempting to push forward vigorously
                            with the war effort in the countryside and to organize the people in the
                            rear. In order to generate popular support emphasis has been placed on
                            bringing to the people a greater measure of social justice. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has attempted to do this by “cleaning
                            up” the organization and administration in Saigon and the countryside,
                            by applying an austerity program, and by focusing attention on
                            corruption and taking measures to eliminate corruption. Further, the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> believes that “it is time to
                            think of North Viet-Nam and to creating a psychological situation there
                            so that the Vietnamese people in the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            can help themselves to fight communism.”</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName> noted that
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and other
                            representatives of the U.S. Government would have an opportunity for
                            fact-finding. For its part, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            would like to hear from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and others an expression of U.S. policies so
                            that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and U.S. could coordinate
                            their policies to better effect and win the war. General <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName> observed that up to now the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had tended to present its own
                            point of view and had perhaps not sought an adequate degree of
                            coordination with the Americans. He felt it was necessary to achieve
                            better coordination in the future. To that end in the discussion to
                            follow the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> spokesman would try to be
                            as honest as possible in presenting the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> point of view.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName> then called on
                            Truong Tai Ton, Minister of Economy and Finance, to present a review of
                            the economic situation and proposals concerning U.S. aid to
                            Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Economic:</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_Ton1">Ton</persName> made the following
                            presentation:</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">General Considerations.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. We are in a <hi rend="italic">total war</hi>. The Government of
                            Vietnam endeavors to safeguard a sound and viable economy along with the
                            ever-growing military efforts. It is essential that exertions in the
                            military field do not impede economic stability. Galloping inflation
                            could be as catastrophic as a military disaster.</p>
                        <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0187"/>
                        <p>Our objective is twofold: to win the war and not to lose peace.</p>
                        <p>2. The Government of Vietnam has already started to implement a series of
                            measures designed to re-establish the national economy and put it on a
                            war-basis: Organization of supply, rice marketing, formation of safety
                            stocks, reorganization of the market, intensification of the tax
                            efforts, budgetary thrift, etc.</p>
                        <p>Those efforts are nevertheless far from sufficient in view of the
                            increasing burdens we have to face. A substantial increase of American
                            economic aid is therefore necessary to the simultaneous carrying out of
                            the war effort and the maintenance of economic stability.</p>
                        <p>3. According to reiterated statements of U.S. leaders, American economic
                            aid to Vietnam is unlimited and unconditional.</p>
                        <p>From the Government of Vietnam point of view this aid must have the
                            following characteristics:</p>
                        <p>a) It has to be proportional to the intensification of the military
                            efforts, that is to approximately match the increase of our budgetary
                            expenditures (from 1960 to 1965, this increase is only due to military
                            burdens).</p>
                        <p>So our budget has more than trebled between 1960 and 1965, going from 15
                            to 47 billion whereas commercial aid (<gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480) has stood at the
                            same level. Consequently, in spite of efforts aimed at increasing our
                            own revenues, our budget which was still in equilibrium in 1961/62 has
                            shown a deficit of 12 billion in 1964 and 23 billion in 1965.</p>
                        <p>b) It must enable us not only to continue the war somehow or other but
                            also to keep ourselves in a fairly good position to face peace.</p>
                        <p>As far as we are concerned the war effort must be total. It should not,
                            however, bleed the country dry of all its financial resources so that we
                            are completely unprepared to face the hour of peace.</p>
                        <p>But the tremendous deficit of our budget, the continuous decrease of our
                            reserves in gold and foreign exchange (U.S. dollars 175 million in
                            January 1964, US dollars 100 million in July 1965) plus difficulties of
                            all sorts generated by the war, are about to jeopardize our economic
                            security. This trend is on the increase and will inevitably lead us to
                            an economic crisis, unless American aid adequately supplements our own
                            efforts.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Proposals.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">
                                <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss> 1965/1966.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>a) The Commercial Import Program (<gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss>)
                            for FY June 1965-June 1966 should be brought up to a minimum of US
                            dollars 200 million. To make its absorption possible, more flexibility
                            and greater eligibility are necessary (to be negotiated between the
                            Ministry of National Economy and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>).</p>
                        <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0188"/>
                        <p>b) The <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss> is primarily aimed at securing
                            piasters for our budget support. One million U.S. dollars generate
                            roughly 80 million <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> piasters. Ten
                            billion piasters are needed to compensate entirely for the increase of
                            military expenditures between 1964 and 1965 (from 17 to 27 billion).
                            This would require an additional amount of 125 million US dollars, that
                            is a total CIP of 125-135 (1964/1965 level) = 260 million in FY
                            1966.</p>
                        <p>c) The increase of <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss> amount will also
                            permit us to establish necessary safety stocks.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is requested a total programmed at about 60 million US dollars, with
                            the permission to buy between 100,000 and 150,000 tons of rice in order
                            to establish a permanent safety stock in Saigon to supply the capital
                            and central provinces with rice.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Direct Aid.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We entirely support the policy consisting of buying in-country all goods
                            which can be produced locally. However, in terms of direct aid, we don't
                            agree with the in-country purchase of imported goods under the <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss> program because such purchases will
                            decrease the <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss> amount.</p>
                        <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Balance of Payments.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Our export situation has deteriorated because of security conditions.
                            Export earnings decreased from 80 million US dollars in 1963 to 35
                            million in 1965 due to the suspension of rice exports and the lessening
                            of other exportable surpluses. At the same time we had to spend our own
                            foreign exchange stock in order to get piasters for the budget and not
                            to disturb the market.</p>
                        <p>The amount of our reserves has lowered in an alarming way (100 million of
                            gold and foreign exchange compared to 175 million in January 1964). At
                            this conjuncture of intensive military effort as well as economic and
                            political tension, a more accentuated decrease will run the risk of
                            destroying confidence in our currency and creating a panic. This will,
                            in a short time, be prejudicial to all military political and economic
                            gains thus far obtained with so much struggle.</p>
                        <p>It is, therefore, suggested that American aid take emergency steps, put
                            US dollars at our disposal to enable us to restore our reserves to the
                            level of 150 million, a sum which we deem minimal to the protection of

                        <p>The rush of US military men and their expenditures in US dollars have
                            seriously disturbed our economy. The black market flourishes. Dollars
                            introduced in the black market then feed illegal transactions (illicit
                            trading of foreign exchange, smuggling, flight of assets, and,

                            sovereignty of our currency are at stake.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, those expenditures in US dollars are harmful to the
                            American soldiers themselves: due to the absence of coins, they have to
                            pay at the minimum price one US dollar for a glass of beer, a haircut or
                            a taxi drive whereas the real price is only between <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> piasters 10 and 30.</p>
                        <p>American authorities should help us stem the black market of dollars,
                            make the exchange of dollars with piasters at the free market rate and

                        <p>The presence of an important number of US military men has brought about

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_Co1">Co</persName> said that the military
                            briefing would be in three parts: (1) Additional <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> force requirements for the remaining months of 1965 and
                            early 1966; (2) a few considerations and recommendations concerning

                            organization of the “home guard” forces. General <persName corresp="#p_Co1">Co</persName> then turned the briefing
                            responsibility to General <persName corresp="#p_Thang1">Thang</persName>, who spelled out additional force requirements as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>For the ground forces—</p>

                        <p>In explaining the background of this additional request, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_Thang1">Thang</persName> noted that the
                            present general reserve consists of 11 battalions, of which 6 are
                            airborne and 5 are Marine battalions. Six of the 11 have been deployed
                            in I Corps and II Corps to meet the step-up in <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> activity in the highlands; 1 airborne battalion suffered
                            over 50 percent casualties in the Dong Xoai battle and is not combat
                            ready. Therefore, only four battalions can be said to be available in
                            the general reserve. In order to meet this critical situation U.S.
                            support for formation of additional battalions as indicated above is
                            urgently requested. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> realizes
                            that this additional request is not part of the 85,000 increase
                            previously agreed upon. General <persName corresp="#p_Thang1">Thang</persName> believed the additional battalions could be
                            recruited without running into the manpower problem because: (a)
                            operational losses (casualties) are relatively lower with these types of
                            units than in the regular <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            battalions; (b) the desertion rate is lower; and, (c) recruitment to
                            activate the additional battalions in Saigon and the other urban areas
                            is generally easier for these units and should not prove too difficult.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_Thang1">Thang</persName> observed that
                            there has been an evolution in regard to the Rangers, beginning with the
                            formation of Ranger companies, then Ranger battalions, then a
                            reinforcement of the Ranger battalions with heavy weapons, and now there
                            is a need to operate the Rangers as 2-3 battalion task forces. This will
                            require augmentation of the Ranger battalion headquarters elements.</p>
                        <p>With regard to present and future strategy, General <persName corresp="#p_Thang1">Thang</persName> said that the situation in I
                            Corps and IV Corps is relatively good. In IV Corps initiative rests with
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> because of the aggressive spirit
                            of the troops and a terrain adapted to helicopter and M-113 operations.
                            In I Corps the situation was relatively good and could be improved if
                            the U.S. Marines were committed more actively to search and destroy
                            operations. II Corps he considered as critical because of the
                            introduction of the entirety of the 325th <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> Division. <persName corresp="#p_Thang1">Thang</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss>
                            had now confirmed all regiments of the 325th Division were now in South
                            Vietnam. He therefore requested that the U.S. dispatch a U.S. Assault
                            Division to help meet this critical situation. Thang noted that the
                            situation in III Corps was not good. The 5th Division is low both in
                            morale and effective strength because of the recent series of battles
                            with the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would like to have the 1st U.S. Infantry Division
                            assigned to this area after the U.S. Assault Division is in place in the
                            highlands. <persName corresp="#p_Thang1">Thang</persName> foresaw a
                            series of large engagements and <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            attacks in the immediate weeks ahead.</p>

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_Thang1">Thang</persName> said that in the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s view Hanoi had two general
                            courses open to it:</p>
                        <p>(1) To make major effort during the monsoon season but eventually to
                            realize that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> victory was
                            impossible and to sue for a cease-fire; and</p>
                        <p>(2) To increase their infiltration and recruitment and make an all-out
                            effort to cut off the highlands from the rest of South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_Thang1">Thang</persName> believed that general
                            objectives should be to (a) stop and destroy units coming from <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> into South Vietnam; (b) destroy all
                            major <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> main force units in the
                            highlands and Central Vietnam; and (c) protect the Vietnamese manpower
                            in South Vietnam to inhibit VC recruitment and exploitation of the
                            manpower pool. Therefore, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>/US
                            should continue bombing attacks against targets in the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and increase the tempo and intensity of
                            the air strikes. With respect to (b) above the U.S. should commit an
                            Assault Division to the highlands and other combat troops from third
                            countries should be deployed there. With regard to (c) above <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>/US should think seriously concerning
                            intensified pacification program to protect the manpower resources. The
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> should commit <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> primarily to this task and deploy
                            Vietnamese units along the coastal lowlands and in the Delta. Under this
                            concept, there would be two general areas—one area, the populous areas
                            where <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would devote its primary
                            efforts; the other, the relatively unpopulated areas where the US/allied
                            forces would concentrate their efforts, it being understood in the
                            latter case that administration for the large cities and district towns
                            would remain with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. The primary
                            missions of the US/allied forces would be search and destroy operations
                            and the protection of important bases. The primary mission of <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> would be to engage in pacification
                            programs and to protect the population.</p>
                        <p>If this concept were approved the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            would suggest that a US Air Assault Division be deployed to an area
                            comprising Kontum, Pleiku and Phu Bon; another Division to operate
                            against Zones C and D. This would require an additional Division for the
                            Banmethuot-Phuoc Thanh area.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the organization of a home guard, <persName corresp="#p_Thang1">Thang</persName> observed that all were agreed
                            that the war cannot be won by military means alone, and that all
                            Vietnamese must take part in the war. This implies that Vietnamese not
                            on active military service be organized into groups. <persName corresp="#p_Thang1">Thang</persName> alluded to efforts under the
                                <persName corresp="#p_Diem1">Diem</persName> regime to organize the
                            Republican Youth and Combat Youth and under General <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nguyen Khanh</persName> to create civil defense
                            organization. The proposed home guard is conceived to be comparable
                            effort and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> intends to mobilize all
                            males between ages 15-48 and all females between 18-30. <persName corresp="#p_Thang1">Thang</persName> said that the chain of command
                            for the home guard would be incorporated in that for the Regional
                            Forces/Popular Forces down to the hamlet level. It is anticipated that
                            the home guard would have special uniforms and insignia and that
                            selected <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0192"/>members would be
                            armed. Thang requested the U.S. to assist the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in developing a realistic plan for the home guard and
                            the necessary support to get it launched.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Questions:</p>

                            proposals and inquired whether there were any questions. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> inquired as to the
                            approximate number of U.S. personnel which the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> desired to have in South Vietnam. Thieu replied that
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> proposal involved the 44

                            would bring this figure to approximately 200,000 U.S. personnel

                            personnel were in South Vietnam only to help fight the war. <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName> believed that most Vietnamese
                            did not consider the U.S. as having any colonialist aspirations but he
                            thought the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> should embark on an
                            extensive propaganda program to explain U.S. presence. Thieu continued
                            that if U.S. forces were concentrated in separate military zones away
                            from the major population centers and areas of dense population that the
                            impact of American presence could be minimized. He said that this
                            consideration was fundamental in suggesting that U.S. forces operate in
                            the highlands and against Zone C and D. Further, the terrain in these
                            areas is difficult and U.S. availability of helicopter lift and mobility
                            would be additional assets. <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName> observed that up to now the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had never had necessary military
                            strength nor the time to conduct a really effective pacification effort
                            in the populated areas. He believed that a concentration of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> attention to this effort made good
                            sense.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that many
                            Americans asked him whether, if the U.S. were to send up to 200,000
                            troops, we could count on a stable government in South Vietnam. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName> replied that in the
                            past there were two general reasons for political instability: (a)
                            previous governments did not have a clear policy and were not strong
                            enough to carry out their announced policies; and (b) previous
                            governments found that after 3-4 months they have been unable to sustain
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> attacks and at the same time to
                            bring social justice to the people. He believed that if U.S. troops were
                            to relieve <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> to work actively on a
                            pacification program, the current government could demonstrate to the
                            people that it is capable and qualified to govern. He added that he
                            would intend under the new home guard organization to train good
                            political and pacification cadres for the pacification program.</p>
                        <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0193"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> inquired as to
                            possible <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> actions particularly whether
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> might increase their strength
                            substantially and what the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and U.S.
                            should do in this event. General <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName> responded that he felt it was more difficult for
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to increase its strength now than
                            in the past. While <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> ranks can be
                            increased through infiltration, we can inhibit this through stepped up
                            bombing of infiltration routes. However, at the present time, at least
                            half of the manpower of South Vietnam is controlled by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. It is therefore essential that the GVN
                            take steps to bring this manpower pool under <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> control.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> noted his
                            surprise at the elimination of the <persName corresp="#p_Chieu1">Chieu
                                Hoi</persName> ministry in the current government and inquired
                            whether the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had a program comparable
                            to the <persName corresp="#p_Chieu1">Chieu Hoi</persName> program.
                                <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName> replied that the
                                <persName corresp="#p_Chieu1">Chieu Hoi</persName> program continues
                            but that the Directory believed that it belonged more properly under the
                                <gloss target="#t_PsyWar1">PsyWar</gloss> Ministry than as a
                            separate ministry. By bringing <persName corresp="#p_Chieu1">Chieu
                                Hoi</persName> within the <gloss target="#t_PsyWar1">PsyWar</gloss>
                            Ministry, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had not intended in
                            any way to denigrate its importance. General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> underlined these remarks, stating that all agree on
                            the importance of <persName corresp="#p_Chieu1">Chieu Hoi</persName> and
                            the need to put more emphasis on this program. However, he believed it
                            was more important to have the <persName corresp="#p_Chieu1">Chieu
                                Hoi</persName> program as part of a more general program to bring
                            the people back under <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> control. With
                            regard to governmental stability, General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> stated that the Vietnamese also long for a strong,
                            stable government. He said that the current government would do its best
                            to maintain stability. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> desired
                            more U.S. troops not because the Vietnamese were unwilling to continue
                            the fight but that it would relieve <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> for important pacification tasks. He added that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> did not like to lose terrain to
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, therefore it was suggested that
                            the US/allied forces help hold terrain while the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> “reorganized the rear”. General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> said the reason for government
                            instability in the past has been primarily the lack of social justice.
                            At present corruption exists everywhere, the rich get richer while the
                            mass of the poor Vietnamese see little hope for improvement. The mass of
                            Vietnamese are therefore very vulnerable to <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> propaganda. In his view previous governments had based
                            their support primarily on the promises of support from minority groups,
                            such as the religious sects and groups of politicians. In contrast, the
                            current government intends to emphasize support of the mass of the
                            Vietnamese, particularly of the poor Vietnamese, and to give them a
                            sense of hope and confidence in the future. <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would
                            ask for more sacrifices from the people and the members of the
                            government were prepared to make their individual sacrifices. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> considers the political and religious
                            groups as being merely individual Vietnamese citizens and not as groups
                            which could validly claim a controlling voice in government policies. It
                            was necessary for the Vietnamese to unite on one road to victory. In
                            this connection none of the Ministers in his government represented <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0194"/>any particular group or faction
                            and they were deliberately chosen for this reason. <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> hoped to satisfy U.S. public opinion concerning
                            governmental stability by making the government strong and stable enough
                            to carry out this announced policy.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            thanked the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> participants for their
                            frankness. He said that the discussion had been most helpful and that he
                            looked forward to further discussions in the succeeding days.</p>

                        <p>172042Z. Yesterday I met three times with Highest Authority on actions
                            associated with 34 battalion plan. In summary, he stated:</p>
                        <p>1. It is his current intention to proceed with 34 battalion plan.</p>
                        <p>2. It is impossible for him to submit supplementary budget request of
                            more than $300-400 million to the Congress before next January.</p>
                        <p>3. If a larger request is made to the Congress, he believes this will
                            kill domestic legislative program.</p>
                        <p>4. We should be prepared to explain to the Congress that we have adequate
                            authority and funds, by use of deficit financing, $700 million
                            supplemental and possible small current supplemental, to finance
                            recommended operations until next January, when we will be able to come
                            up with clear and precise figures as to what is required.</p>
                        <p>I asked Highest Authority whether request for legislation authorizing
                            call-up of reserves and extension of tours of duty would be acceptable
                            in the light of his comments concerning domestic program, and he stated
                            that it would.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out that we would have great difficulties with Senator Stennis
                            concerning this course of action. He said that he recognized that we
                            would but <pb n="163" xml:id="pg_163" facs="0195"/>we would just have to
                            bull it through. He requested that I talk to Senator Russell on
                                Monday,<note n="2" xml:id="d61fn2">July 19. </note> and I will do
                            so.</p>
                        <p>I have talked to Charlie Hitch and Paul Ignatius about this, and the
                            three of us will determine whether we can achieve what Highest Authority
                            desires. I have also talked to McGeorge Bundy but do not plan to mention
                            it to anyone else.</p>
                        <p>In meantime, planning exercise is proceeding according to schedule and we
                            expect to have plans completed for your review upon return. Also expect

                            is important to do only the things which we have to do (like calling

                                legislation.<note n="4" xml:id="d64fn4">Not further identified.
                            </note> The planned reserve call-up will be one Marine Division and six
                            Army Reserve Brigades (a total of 27 battalions). Beyond this, there
                            would be temporary additions to the active forces of 27 battalions (nine
                            Marine and 18 Army), plus a permanent addition of nine more Army
                            battalions. This makes a total addition of 63 battalions. (At Tab B is a

                            of your plans—presumably in a message to the Congress.</p>
                        <p>Indeed the timing of the message to the Congress is really the D-Day for

                            recommend against going to the Hill before the first of the week. But a
                            delay beyond Monday would seem to me to create too wide a gap between
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s return and the
                            point of decision. If you agree, we might tentatively plan that you

                            on Monday.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, it is increasingly urgent that we get ahead with
                            planning for public support. Doug Cater is ready to go ahead with plans
                            to provide speech materials to friendly Senators and Congressmen, and
                            everyone is ready to go ahead with the Citizens Committee as soon as you
                            give the signal. I continue to think that Arthur Dean would be an
                            excellent choice for us, but he is by no means the only possibility.</p>
                        <p>I have suggested to Jack Valenti that Rusk and <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> and I have lunch with you

                            fruitful five-day period together and the important recommendations
                            which he will present to you have the full concurrence of Johnson,
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> and me.</p>
                        <p>Two events below the level of importance of the Secretary's report are
                            still worth mentioning. The first is the capture and death of Colonel
                            Pham Ngoc Thao, the inveterate and skillful intriguer whose hand was
                            behind abortive coup attempts of February 19 and May 20 of this year.
                            Since the latter, he has been lying low in the vicinity of Saigon
                            eluding apprehension by the police and thus avoiding the execution of
                            the death sentence leveled on him in absentia by a military court.
                            Although Thao was close to the extremists within the northern Catholic
                            refugee bloc, leading clerics such as Papal Delegate Palmas have been
                            openly expressing the hope that Thao could be removed from the country
                            and his troublemaking activities suppressed. Although his death,
                            presumably from wounds received at the time of his apprehension, may
                            stir resentment in lower Catholic circles, it is doubtful that it will
                            generate any emotional reaction among the substantial members of the
                            church.</p>
                        <p>The Viet Cong monsoon offensive dropped off rather sharply during the
                            week in which the guerrillas initiated only one battalion size attack.
                                <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>, on the other hand, executed
                            successfully one of their most complex military operations of the war in
                            opening the road from Qui Nhon to Pleiku for the movement of essential
                            civilian and military cargo. Participants included 12 <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> battalions and the B-52 <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bombers from Guam which engaged in a
                            close air support mission to assist Vietnamese Marines. The operation
                            seems to have taken the Viet Cong by surprise who thus far have made no
                            reaction, and convoys are rolling freely back and forth. They were badly
                            needed to relieve the shortage of commodities in the highland area
                            resulting from Viet Cong interdiction of routes.</p>

                        <p>Following are my present views concerning our future course as regards
                            Viet-Nam:</p>
                        <p>1. I concur in the specific recommendations contained in Paragraph 5 of
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s
                                Report.<note n="2" xml:id="d66fn2">
                                <ref target="#d67">Document 67</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Continue all activities against North Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>3. Make strong points of the great seaports, notably Danang, Cam Ranh,
                            and Saigon and, possibly, some places in the interior which can be
                            readily maintained.</p>
                        <p>4. From these strong points the Vietnamese, with our advice and help,
                            should conduct their program of pacification by means of a true
                            Revolution for a New Life, on which a start has been attempted in the
                            Hop Tac area. With the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> and police
                            providing security, this should be an affirmative, highly political oil
                            spot procedure, never striving for flashy and misleading statistics,
                            always seeking solid and durable gains, however small, however slowly
                            achieved. My intended program of stationing a few carefully selected
                            political coordinators in a few provinces, working directly under the
                            Embassy, attempts to create such a procedure. Once we and the South
                            Vietnamese learn how to do this, the oil spots will connect with each
                            other and the Viet Cong military manpower pool will inevitably shrink.
                            Neither bombing nor conventional ground warfare will reach the terrorist
                            working as an individual and in small groups—and they are the backbone
                            of Viet Cong recruiting.</p>
                        <p>5. If the opportunity offers, U.S. troops can fight the pitched battle
                            with large units of the Viet Cong—as they attack our strong points, and
                            possibly, in other places where they can be identified and where the
                            circumstances are such that the outlook for destroying them is
                            propitious. <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0203"/>There may be good
                            chances to open and secure roads. But U.S. troops should not be
                            committed to prolonged “search sweeps” in the jungle or to being
                            permanently stationed in the jungle.</p>
                        <p>6. No one can establish schedules or make predictions. As President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> has often well said
                            of the American pioneers—from Plymouth Rock to the Far West—we must
                            endure and, as we endure, we will learn and opportunities will come.</p>
                        <p>7. But our grandchildren will not live to see the day that a united China
                            does not probe in Southeast Asia.</p>

                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Introduction</hi>. Our object in Vietnam is to
                            create conditions for a favorable outcome by demonstrating to the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> that
                            the odds are against their winning. We want to create these conditions,
                            if possible, without causing the war to expand into one with China or
                            the Soviet Union and in a way which preserves support of the American
                            people and, hopefully, of our allies and friends. The following
                            assessments, made following my trip to Vietnam with Ambassador-designate
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>, are my own and are addressed
                            to the achievement of that object. My specific recommendations appear in
                            paragraph 5; they are concurred in by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>, Ambassador-designate <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>, Ambassador Johnson, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAUSG1">Sharp</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>. I have neither asked for
                            nor obtained their concurrence in other portions of the paper.<note n="2" xml:id="d67fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> discussed the

                                found that “to a man they shared his estimate.” After reading the

                                it meant accepting the chance that the war would be increasingly
                                Americanized.” (Johnson Library, Papers of <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William P. Bundy</persName>, Ch. 27, p.

                            outcome” for purposes of these assessments and recommendations has nine
                            fundamental elements:</p>
                        <p>(a) <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> stop attacks and drastically reduce
                            incidents of terror and sabotage.</p>
                        <p>(b) <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> reduces infiltration to a
                            trickle, with some reasonably reliable method of our obtaining
                            confirmation of this fact.</p>
                        <p>(c) US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> stop bombing of North
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>(d) <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> stays independent (hopefully
                            pro-US, but possibly genuinely neutral).</p>
                        <p>(e) <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> exercises governmental functions
                            over substantially all of South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>(f) Communists remain quiescent in Laos and Thailand.</p>
                        <p>(g) <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> withdraws <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> forces and other North Vietnamese
                            infiltrators (not regroupees) from South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>(h) <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>
                            transform from a military to a purely political organization.</p>
                        <p>(i) US combat forces (not advisors or <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>) withdraw.</p>
                        <p>A favorable outcome could include also arrangements regarding elections,
                            relations between North and South Vietnam, participation in
                            peace-keeping by international forces, membership for North and South
                            Vietnam in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and so on. The nine
                            fundamental elements can evolve with or without an express agreement
                            and, except for what might be negotiated incidental to a cease-fire, are
                            more likely to evolve without an express agreement than with one. We do
                            not need now to address the question whether ultimately we would settle
                            for something less than the nine fundamentals; because deployment of the
                            forces recommended in paragraph 5 is prerequisite to the achievement of
                            any acceptable settlement, and a decision can be made later, when
                            bargaining becomes a reality, whether to compromise in any
                            particular.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Estimate of the situation</hi>. The situation in
                            South Vietnam is worse than a year ago (when it was worse than a year
                            before that). After a few months of stalemate, the tempo of the war has
                            quickened. A hard <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> push is now on to
                            dismember the nation and to maul the army. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> main and local forces, reinforced by militia and
                            guerrillas, have the initiative and, with large attacks (some in
                            regimental strength), are hurting <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            forces badly. The main <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> efforts have
                            been in southern I Corps, northern and central II Corps and north of
                            Saigon. The central highlands could well be lost to the National
                            Liberation Front during this monsoon season. Since June 1, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has been forced to abandon six district
                            capitals; only one has been retaken. US combat troop deployments and
                                US/<gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> strikes against the North
                            have put to rest most South Vietnamese fears that the United States will
                            foresake them, and US/<gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> air strikes
                            in-country have probably shaken <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> morale
                            somewhat. Yet the government is able to provide security to fewer and
                            fewer people in less and less territory as terrorism increases. Cities
                            and towns are being isolated as <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173" facs="0205"/>fewer and fewer roads and railroads are usable and power and
                            communications lines are cut.</p>
                        <p>The economy is deteriorating—the war is disrupting rubber production,
                            rice distribution, Dalat vegetable production and the coastal fishing
                            industry, causing the loss of jobs and income, displacement of people
                            and frequent breakdown or suspension of vital means of transportation
                            and communication; foreign exchange earnings have fallen; and severe
                            inflation is threatened.</p>
                        <p>The odds are less than even that the <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> government will last out the year. <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> is “executive agent” for a
                            directorate of generals. His government is youthful and inexperienced,
                            but dedicated to a “revolutionary” program. His tenure depends upon
                            unity of the armed forces behind him. If the directorate holds together
                            and the downward trend of the war is halted, the religious and regional
                            factions will probably remain quiescent; otherwise there will be
                            political turbulence and possibly uncoordinated efforts to negotiate
                            settlement with the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. The Buddhists,
                            Catholics, out-politicians and business community are “wait-and-seeing;”
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, while unable alone to generate
                            effective unrest in the cities, can “piggy-back” on any anti-government
                            demonstration or cause.</p>
                        <p>Rural reconstruction (pacification) even in the Hop Tac area around
                            Saigon is making little progress. Gains in IV Corps are being held, but
                            in I and II Corps and adjacent III Corps areas it has lost ground fast
                            since the start of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> monsoon
                            offensive (300,000 people have been lost to the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, and tens of thousands of refugees have poured out of
                            these areas).</p>
                        <p>The Government-to-<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> ratio over-all is now
                            only a little better than 3-to-1, and in combat battalions little better
                            than 1.5-to-1. Some <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units have
                            been mauled; many are understrength and therefore “conservative.”
                            Desertions are at a high rate, and the force build-up has slipped badly.
                            The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, who are undoubtedly suffering
                            badly too (their losses are very high), now control a South Vietnamese
                            manpower pool of 500,000 to 1 million fighting-age men and reportedly
                            are trying to double their combat strength, largely by forced draft
                            (down to 15-year-olds) in the increasing areas they control. They seem
                            to be able more than to replace their losses.</p>
                        <p>There are no signs that we have throttled the inflow of supplies for the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> or can throttle the flow while
                            their materiel needs are as low as they are; indeed more and better
                            weapons have been observed in <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> hands,
                            and it is probable that there has been further build-up of North
                            Vietnamese regular units in the I and II Corps areas, with at least
                            three full regiments (all of the 325th Division) there. Nor have our air
                            attacks in North Vietnam produced tangible evidence of willingness on
                            the part of Hanoi to come to the conference table in a reasonable mood.
                            The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> seem to believe that South Vietnam is on the run and
                            near collapse; they show no signs of settling for less than a complete
                            take-over.</p>

                            courses of action with respect to Vietnam all of which involve different
                            probabilities, outcomes and costs:</p>
                        <p>(a) Cut our losses and withdraw under the best conditions that can be
                            arranged—almost certainly conditions humiliating the United States and
                            very damaging to our future effectiveness on the world scene.</p>
                        <p>(b) Continue at about the present level, with the US forces limited to
                            say 75,000, holding on and playing for the breaks—a course of action
                            which, because our position would grow weaker, almost certainly would
                            confront us later with a choice between withdrawal and an emergency
                            expansion of forces, perhaps too late to do any good.</p>
                        <p>(c) Expand promptly and substantially the US military pressure against
                            the Viet Cong in the South and maintain the military pressure against
                            the North Vietnamese in the North while launching a vigorous effort on
                            the political side<note n="3" xml:id="d67fn3">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> states “any further

                            favorable outcome by clarifying our objectives and establishing channels
                            of communication. This alternative would stave off defeat in the short
                            run and offer a good chance of producing a favorable settlement in the
                            longer run; at the same time it would imply a commitment to see a
                            fighting war clear through at considerable cost in casualties and
                            materiel and would make any later decision to withdraw even more
                            difficult and even more costly than would be the case today.</p>
                        <p>My recommendations in paragraph 5 below are based on the choice of the
                            third alternative (Option c) as the course of action involving the best
                            odds of the best outcome with the most acceptable cost to the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Military recommendations.</hi> There are now 15 US
                            (and 1 Australian) combat battalions in Vietnam; they, together with
                            other combat personnel and non-combat personnel, bring the total US
                            personnel in Vietnam to approximately 75,000.</p>
                        <p>a. I recommend that the deployment of US ground troops in Vietnam be
                            increased by October to 34 maneuver battalions (or, if the Koreans fail
                            to provide the expected 9 battalions promptly, to 43 battalions). The
                            battalions—together with increases in helicopter lift, air squadrons,
                            naval units, air defense, combat support and miscellaneous log support
                            and advisory personnel which I also recommend—would bring the total US
                            personnel in Vietnam to approximately 175,000 (200,000 if we must make
                            up for the Korean failure). It should be understood that the deployment
                            of more men (an additional perhaps 100,000) <pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0207"/>may be necessary in early 1966, and that the deployment
                            of additional forces thereafter is possible but will depend on
                            developments.</p>
                        <p>b. I recommend that Congress be requested to authorize the call-up of
                            approximately 235,000 men in the Reserve and National Guard. This
                            number—approximately 125,000 Army, 75,000 Marines, 25,000 Air Force and
                            10,000 Navy—would provide approximately 36 maneuver battalions by the
                            end of this year. The call-up would be for a two-year period; but the
                            intention would be to release them after one year, by which time they
                            could be relieved by regular forces if conditions permitted.</p>
                        <p>c. I recommend that the regular armed forces be increased by
                            approximately 375,000 men (approximately 250,000 Army, 75,000 Marines,
                            25,000 Air Force and 25,000 Navy). This would provide approximately 27
                            additional maneuver battalions by the middle of 1966. The increase would
                            be accomplished by increasing recruitment, increasing the draft and
                            extending tours of duty of men already in the service.</p>
                        <p>d. I recommend that a supplemental appropriation of approximately $X for
                            FY 1966 be sought from the Congress to cover the first part of the added
                            costs attributable to the build-up in and for the war in Vietnam. A
                            further supplemental appropriation might be required later in the fiscal
                            year.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted that in mid-1966 the United States would, as a
                            consequence of the above method of handling the build-up, have
                            approximately 600,000 additional men (approximately 63 additional
                            maneuver battalions) as protection against contingencies.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Use of forces.</hi> The forces will be used however
                            they can be brought to bear most effectively. The US/third-country
                            ground forces will operate in coordination with South Vietnamese forces.
                            They will defend their own bases; they will assist in providing security
                            in neighboring areas; they will augment Vietnamese forces, assuring
                            retention of key logistic areas and population centers. Also, in the
                            initial phase they will maintain a small reserve-reaction force,
                            conducting nuisance raids and spoiling attacks, and opening and securing
                            selected lines of communication; as in-country ground strength increases
                            to a level permitting extended US and third-country offensive action,
                            the forces will be available for more active combat missions when the
                            Vietnamese Government and General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> agree that such active missions are needed.
                            The strategy for winning this stage of the war will be to take the
                            offensive—to take and hold the initiative. The concept of tactical
                            operations will be to exploit the offensive, with the objects of putting
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> battalion forces out of operation and of destroying
                            their morale. The South Vietnamese, US and third-country forces, by
                            aggressive exploitation of superior military forces, are to gain and
                            hold the initiative—keeping the enemy at a disadvantage, maintaining a
                            tempo such as to deny them time to recuperate or regain their balance,
                            and pressing the fight against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> main force <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0208"/>units in South Vietnam to run them to ground and
                            destroy them. The operations should combine to compel the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to
                            fight at a higher and more sustained intensity with resulting higher
                            logistical consumption and, at the same time, to limit his capability to
                            resupply forces in combat at that scale by attacking his <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>. The concept assumes vigorous
                            prosecution of the air and sea anti-infiltration campaign and includes
                            increased use of air in-country, including B-52s, night and day to
                            harass <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in their havens. Following
                            destruction of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> main force units,
                            the South Vietnamese must reinstitute the Program of Rural
                            Reconstruction as an antidote to the continuing <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> campaign of terror and subversion.</p>
                        <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Actions against North Vietnam.</hi> We should
                            continue the program of bombing military targets in North Vietnam. While
                            avoiding striking population and industrial targets not closely related
                            to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>'s supply of war materiel to
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, we should announce to Hanoi and
                            carry out actions to destroy such supplies and to interdict their flow.
                            The number of strike sorties against North Vietnam—against fixed targets
                            and for armed reconnaissance—should increase slowly from the present
                            level of 2,500 a month to 4,000 or more a month. We should be prepared
                            at any time to carry out a severe reprisal should the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            commit a particularly damaging or horrendous act (e.g., <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> interdiction of the Saigon river could
                            call for a quarantine of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> harbors, or
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> assassination of a high-ranking US
                            official could call for destruction of all of the major power plants in
                            North Vietnam); the chances of our reprisal action leading to escalation
                            is not large in such an instance. After the 44 US/third-country
                            battalions have been deployed and after some strong action has been
                            taken in the program of bombing the North (e.g., after the key railroad
                            bridges north of Hanoi have been dropped), we could, as part of a
                            diplomatic initiative, consider introducing a 6-8 week pause in the
                            program of bombing the North.</p>
                        <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Other actions in South Vietnam.</hi> The military
                            program cannot do the job alone. Among others, the following actions
                            should also be taken in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>a. Continue doggedly to “strengthen the rear” by pressing forward with
                            the rural reconstruction (pacification) program, realizing both that the
                            program has little chance of meaningful success unless and until
                            security can be provided, and that the program is fundamental to full
                            success once security is provided.</p>
                        <p>b. Keep working with the government in Saigon to make it more stable.
                            Consider using the deployment of the US troops as the occasion to lay
                            down some terms—e.g., regarding the presence and use of a US-controlled
                            rice reserve, an effective US veto on major GVN military commanders,
                            statements about invading North Vietnam, and so on.</p>
                        <pb n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0209"/>
                        <p>c. Take steps to meet the economic shortages and disruptions. Especially,
                            the recurring threat of rice inflation should be countered by the
                            provision of an in-country US-controlled rice reserve.</p>
                        <p>d. Take informational actions to undermine <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> morale by reference to <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            defeats, to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>/US weapon superiority,
                            to air attacks on their bases, etc., and by encouraging <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to defect either to the government or
                            “back home.” In this connection, the Chieu Hoi program (to induce <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> defections) must be revitalized
                            immediately.</p>

                                in the source text.]</note> Together with the above military moves,
                            we should take political initiatives in order to lay a groundwork for a
                            favorable political settlement by clarifying our objectives and
                            establishing channels of communications. At the same time as we are
                            taking steps to turn the tide in South Vietnam, we should make quiet
                            moves through diplomatic channels (a) to open a dialogue with Moscow and
                            Hanoi, and perhaps the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, looking first
                            toward disabusing them of any misconceptions as to our goals and second
                            toward laying the groundwork for a settlement when the time is ripe; (b)
                            to keep the Soviet Union from deepening its military involvement and
                            support of North Vietnam and from generating crises elsewhere in the
                            world until the time when settlement can be achieved; and (c) to cement
                            support for US policy by the US public, allies and friends, and to keep
                            international opposition at a manageable level. Our efforts may be
                            unproductive until the tide begins to turn, but nevertheless they should
                            be made.</p>

                                forces.</hi> Three factors dominate the psychological situation in
                            South Vietnam: (a) the military situation (i.e., the security problem),
                            (b) the effectiveness of the government as a vehicle for dynamic
                            leadership, and (c) the implications of the growing American presence.
                            The deployments recommended in paragraph 5 run some risk of causing the
                            Vietnamese to “turn the war over to us” and of generating an
                            “anti-colonial” type resentment toward us. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has requested the additional US forces urgently
                            (indeed, they want 9 battalions more than the 44 recommended here). When
                                <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> was asked about the popular
                            reaction, he said, “We will explain it to our people.” <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName> agreed saying, “They know that
                            you are not here to make us a colony.” Former Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> told me, “The only way to save
                            Vietnam is to send a large number of troops.” He added, “The people of
                            South Vietnam will not object.” The spectres of widespread adverse
                            public reaction have been raised each time we deployed personnel in the
                            past, and, while no deployment has been so massive as this one, no such
                            reaction appeared. Furthermore, the key requirement for continued
                            viability of the Vietnamese spirit in the short run is evidence that <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0210"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>/US/third-country forces can
                            contain the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> monsoon offensive and reopen communications; in the
                            longer run the requirement will be evidence of bringing the war to a
                            satisfactory close.</p>
                        <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Communist reaction to the expanded program.</hi>
                            The Soviets can be expected to continue material assistance to North
                            Vietnam and to lodge verbal complaints, but not to intervene otherwise.
                            The Chinese—at least so long as we do not invade North Vietnam, do not
                            sink a Chinese ship and, most important, do not strike China—will
                            probably not send regular ground forces or aircraft into the war. The
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, on the other hand, may well
                            send up to several divisions of regular forces in South Vietnam to
                            assist the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> if they see the tide
                            turning and victory, once so near, being snatched away. This possible
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> action is the most ominous one,
                            since it would lead to increased pressures on us to “counter-invade”
                            North Vietnam and to extend air strikes to population targets in the
                            North; acceding to these pressures could bring the Soviets and the
                            Chinese in. The Viet Cong, especially if they continue to take high
                            losses, can be expected to depend increasingly upon the <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> forces as the war moves into a more
                            conventional phase; but they may find ways to continue almost
                            indefinitely their present intensive military, guerrilla and terror
                            activities, particularly if reinforced by some regular <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> units. A key question on the military
                            side is whether <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>, ammunition, and
                            cadres can be cut off and, if they are cut off, whether this really
                            renders the Viet Cong impotent.</p>

                            without more active assistance from more US/third-country ground forces
                            than those thus far committed. Without further outside help, the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> is faced with successive tactical
                            reverses, loss of key communication and population centers particularly

                            spirit, and on whether the US forces can be effective in a
                            quick-reaction reserve role, a role in which they are only now being
                            tested. The number of US troops is too small to make a significant
                            difference in the traditional 10-1 government-guerrilla formula, but it
                            is not too small to make a significant difference in the kind of war
                            which seems to be evolving in Vietnam—a “Third Stage” or conventional
                            war in which it is easier to identify, locate and attack the enemy.</p>
                        <p>The plan is such that the risk of escalation into war with China or the
                            Soviet Union can be kept small. US and South Vietnamese casualties will
                            increase—just how much cannot be predicted with confidence, but the US
                            killed-in-action might be in the vicinity of 500 a month by the end of
                                <pb n="179" xml:id="pg_179" facs="0211"/>the year. The South
                            Vietnamese under one government or another will probably see the thing
                                through<note n="5" xml:id="d67fn5">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> points out that we may face
                                a neutralist government at some time in the future and that in those
                                circumstances the US should be prepared to carry on alone. [Footnote
                                in the source text.]</note> and the United States public will
                            support the course of action because it is a sensible and courageous
                            military-political program designed and likely to bring about a success
                            in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>It should be recognized, however, that success against the larger, more
                            conventional <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> forces could merely drive the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> back into the trees and back to their 1960-64 pattern—a
                            pattern against which US troops and aircraft would be of limited value
                            but with which the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, with our help,
                            could cope. The questions here would be whether the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> could maintain morale after such a
                            set-back, and whether the South Vietnamese would have the will to hang
                            on through another cycle. It should be recognized also that, even in
                            “success,” it is not obvious how we will be able to disengage our forces
                            from Vietnam. It is unlikely that a formal agreement good enough for the
                            purpose could possibly be negotiated—because the arrangement can reflect
                            little more than the power situation. A fairly large number of US (or
                            perhaps “international”) forces may be required to stay in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The overall evaluation is that the course of action recommended in this
                            memorandum—if the military and political moves are properly integrated
                            and executed with continuing vigor and visible determination—stands a
                            good chance of achieving an acceptable outcome within a reasonable time
                            in Vietnam.</p>

                        <p>On July 21, 1965, Ambassador at <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Large W.
                                Averell Harriman</persName> met with Soviet Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> for a second time during his
                            visit to Moscow. (For a report of <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s initial conversation with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> on July 15, see <ref target="#d59">Document 59</ref>.) The discussion again covered the
                            full range of major issues affecting U.S.-Soviet relations, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> stressed that a
                            settlement of the Vietnam conflict was essential to progress on other
                            issues. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> noted that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had authorized
                            him to state that U.S. military action in Vietnam would be limited to
                            whatever was necessary to stop the aggression directed from Hanoi, and
                            the President <pb n="180" xml:id="pg_180" facs="0212"/>felt that the
                            Vietnam conflict should not interfere with U.S.-Soviet relations.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> added that the
                            United States agreed that it was important to move the Vietnam issue to
                            the conference table as soon as possible, and welcomed any Soviet
                            suggestions to that end.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> responded that the Soviet
                            Union was not authorized to negotiate concerning Vietnam, but noted that
                            the “Vietnamese comrades would not exclude political settlement,
                            bypassing the Chinese.” He advised the United States to study Pham Van
                            Dong's four points and make counterproposals directly to the North
                            Vietnamese. He added that he felt that such a political settlement would
                            be based on the retention of the 17th parallel as the dividing line
                            between North and South Vietnam. (Telegram 216 from Moscow, July 21;

                        <p>On July 23, <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> stopped in
                            Bonn and cabled his impressions of his conversations with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and Secretary Rusk. On Vietnam,
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> reported: “I got
                            nowhere in persuading him that N.L.F. was not the voice of the people,
                            and that Saigon spoke for the majority who don't want communist
                            take-over. It was interesting, however, that he mentioned the retention
                            of the 17th parallel. His biggest concern is the embarrassing position
                            the Soviets are caught in. And he wants a settlement. I doubt that he
                            personally cares too much on what basis, though he will obviously have
                            to support North Vietnam demands at any conference. He would make no
                            suggestion for settlement except that we get together with North
                            Vietnam, and he implied that we should disregard Peiping.” (Telegram 241
                            from Bonn, July 23; ibid.)</p>
                        <p>On the morning of July 22, Rusk telephoned McGeorge Bundy and asked if he
                            had seen <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s report. Rusk
                            thought the President would be interested. Bundy noted that he had seen
                            it and passed it on to the President. Rusk said that he had called
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and told him that
                            the administration should think hard about the possibility of dealing
                            with the problem of South Vietnam in a low key. He felt that <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s message suggested a more
                            critical examination of the number of U.S. troops to be committed to
                            Vietnam, and of the rate at which they would be used. Bundy responded
                            that the problem had become so large that it would be difficult to play
                            it in a lower key. (Ibid., Rusk Files: Lot 72 D 192, Telephone
                            Conversations)</p>
                        <p>Rusk telephoned <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> on
                            the evening of July 22 and instructed him to begin to think hard about
                            establishing contact with Hanoi in connection with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s remarks to <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>. Rusk added that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s suggestion could turn out to
                            be very significant. He had talked to the President and they agreed that
                            it was important to consider “very hard and very fast” whether the
                            United States could find some way to take account of what <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said. Rusk felt that the North
                            Vietnamese four points were subject to “dickering.” Bundy said that he
                            would work on it. (Ibid.)</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The attached study was prepared at the direction of the Chairman by a
                            small group working under General <persName corresp="#p_GLGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName>. It has no endorsement at the moment, and,
                            therefore, should be treated as a non-study. However, some of the
                            contents could be useful to you as background for the coming discussions
                            on Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The study advocates a two-fold approach:</p>
                        <p>(1) Stepped-up air offensive against transportation and military targets
                            in <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> with later extension to
                            industrial targets as necessary (but no attacks on population).</p>
                        <p>(2) Use of U.S. and third country forces to eliminate the Viet Cong
                            regular battalions (the 44 battalion force previously recommended was
                            considered probably sufficient).</p>
                        <p>In furthering the interdiction of supply routes, the study recommends
                            that the route nine type barrier be established as “experience is gained
                            and capability is developed.”</p>
                        <p>This looks like an excellent military concept, but the other half of the
                            equation is equally important—an intense program to win over the peasant
                            population and the Viet Cong irregulars, themselves.</p>

                        <p>This study was prepared in response to an oral directive of the Chairman,
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff, on 2 July 1965, to prepare for his use an
                            assessment of the assurance the US can have of winning in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> if we do “everything we can.”</p>
                        <p>The study was prepared by an ad hoc staff group under the direction of
                            the Office of the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, with representation
                            from that office and the Chairman's Special Studies Group, the Defense
                            Intelligence Agency, J-3, and the Joint War Games Agency.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Summary Report</p>
                        <p>1. As directed, a study group has assessed the assurance the US can have
                            of winning in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> if we do “everything
                            we can.”</p>
                        <p>2. The limitations of the resulting assessment require specific note. It
                            is not final nor is it complete in detail. For operations within <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, the assessment does not address
                            explicitly the task of providing territorial security, but rather is
                            focused upon operations against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> battalion-size units. Even for such
                            operations, the military judgment involved in arriving at expected
                            results is as difficult and complex as it is important. Exact, certain
                            solutions cannot be achieved. Time has not permitted discussions with

                            against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> battalion-size units in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. Nevertheless, a responsive over-all appraisal addressed to the central
                            question can already be given. It amounts to a conditional affirmative,
                            as follows: Within the bounds of reasonable assumptions (particularly as
                            set out below) there appears to be no reason we cannot win if such is
                            our will—and if that will is manifested in strategy and tactical
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>4. While there are important uncertainties and unknowns, there is little
                            probability that they could invalidate this judgment, providing the
                            assumptions hold true. The key question appears to resolve itself into a
                            matter of means and willingness to use the means. Neither the means
                            visualized, nor the use of these means, appears to go beyond the bounds
                            of reason, realism or prudence. It is possible to outline them with a
                            fair degree of definition.</p>
                        <p>5. Before doing so, specific note should be taken of the major
                            assumptions which limit the scope of the study and condition the
                            over-all conclusion stated above. They are, in summary, as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. China and Russia will not intervene with armed forces, overtly or
                            covertly, so long as there is no US/<gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                            land invasion of <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>b. Restrictions on US/<gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> use of force do
                            not exceed the following:</p>
                        <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0215"/>
                        <p>(1) No land invasion of <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> by US/<gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> forces.</p>
                        <p>(2) No use of nuclear weapons or chemical weapons.</p>
                        <p>(3) No mass bombing of population per se.</p>
                        <p>c. Once the concept envisaged in this study is approved by higher
                            authority, operations within the scope of the proposed strategy will not
                            be subject to restriction, delay, or planning uncertainties. This
                            implies that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will cooperate as
                            necessary to this end.</p>
                        <p>d. Operational coordination between US and <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> forces meets minimum acceptable professional standards
                            of effectiveness.</p>
                        <p>e. Neither the government nor the population of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> turns against the US and demands withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>6. “Winning” in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, as referred to
                            above, involves achieving an outcome somewhere between, as a maximum, an
                            end to insurgency by <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> decision and as an acceptable minimum,
                            containment of the insurgency, except for minor areas and minor acts of
                            violence, with an end to the need for the presence of substantial US
                            forces. This outcome, the assessment indicates, can be achieved.
                            Hopefully, the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> will become convinced that they cannot win in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, that continued efforts will be
                            extremely costly, and that time is on the side of the Free World. But
                            even if they fight on, it should be possible to attain the minimum cited
                            above. (Outcomes such as complete loss of the area, further erosion,
                            “losing slowly,” and “begging down” in a series of beleaguered coastal
                            enclaves or in inconclusive jungle combat are judged to represent
                            failing rather than winning in the area, and are rejected.)</p>
                        <p>7. To achieve a “winning” outcome in the above sense requires a
                            substantial step-up in the scope and effectiveness of US/<gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> operations in the area. Sources for
                            this step-up include the following, all of which are required:</p>
                        <p>a. Additional forces.</p>
                        <p>b. Removal of restrictions, restraints and sources of delay and planning
                            uncertainty.</p>
                        <p>c. Adoption of a strategy for winning the war; such a strategy must be
                            based upon taking the offensive, and gaining and holding the
                            initiative.</p>
                        <p>d. Adoption of a concept of tactical operations in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> which exploits the offensive, with the
                            object of putting the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> battalion forces out of operation.</p>
                        <p>8. Of these, strategy sets the framework. The strategy contained in the
                            study and outlined below envisages establishing in Southeast Asia a
                            heavy preponderance of US/<gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> military
                            power over the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, provides a concept for the employment of these forces
                            in the next six to eight months, sets forth objectives and weight of
                            attack for an integrated, interrelated effort involving operations
                            against North Vietnam and operations in South Vietnam, together with
                            action against infiltration in <pb n="184" xml:id="pg_184" facs="0216"/>Laos and elsewhere, and indicates broad factors of timing, priority,
                            and coordination between these principal courses of action. This
                            strategy, which is considered feasible and well-calculated to give high
                            assurance of winning in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, is set
                            forth in essential outline below. It presupposes the removal of
                            restrictions, delays and planning uncertainties, as well as the
                            completion of preparatory coordinating arrangements at governmental and
                            military level with the South Vietnamese and, to the extent required,
                            with the Thais and Laotians.</p>
                        <p>9. The basic concept is that allied forces (US, <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and third country), by aggressive exploitation of
                            superior military force, gain and keep the initiative both in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and against <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>, keeping the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> at a disadvantage, keeping the
                            tempo such as to deny them time to recuperate or regain their balance,
                            progressively destroying the war-supporting power of North Vietnam, and
                            pressing the fight against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> main force units in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> to run them to ground and destroy them.
                            The object is to cause them to stop the war, or to render them
                            ineffective if they seek to pursue it. The operations combine to compel
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to fight at higher and more sustained intensity with
                            resulting greater logistical consumption and concurrently attack his
                                <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> to limit his capability to
                            resupply forces in combat at this scale.</p>
                        <p>a. Operations against North Vietnam. The object is two-fold—to bring
                            about a <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> decision to stop the war or,
                            failing this, at a minimum, to cut down and limit sharply the support by
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> forces in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> at the same time being prepared to
                            limit the introduction of additional <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            forces into <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, if attempted, in order
                            to permit containment of the insurgency in the south. By sustained air
                            action the following main categories of targets should be attacked, with
                            timing as indicated:</p>
                        <p>(1) Prior to the initiation of large-scale offensive operations by US
                            forces in South Vietnam, transportation throughout the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> should be attacked in all its
                            components, to include attack on <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>
                            (including locks) and vehicles, attack on <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>, and mining of harbors. In addition, attacks should be
                            conducted on military supplies and equipment, to include attacks on
                            depots, arsenals, barracks and service installations, together with
                            attacks on electric power facilities.</p>
                        <p>(2) If the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> continue the war in South Vietnam after the foregoing
                            attacks have been accomplished, the attack should be extended to include
                            industrial facilities and, to the extent feasible, agricultural
                            resources.</p>
                        <p>(3) At any time required to prevent interference or threatened
                            interference with the above, US/<gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                            forces should attack the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> counterair
                            capability, to include radars, <gloss target="#t_AAA1">AAA</gloss>,
                                <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s, <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>s, and <gloss target="#t_IL281">IL-28</gloss>s. (In this
                            connection, it should be noted that strong factors even now weigh in
                            favor of such strikes.)</p>
                        <p>b. Action against infiltration routes. With the object of cutting down
                            the numbers of men and quantities of supplies moving into <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, the following major operations should
                            be conducted:</p>
                        <pb n="185" xml:id="pg_185" facs="0217"/>
                        <p>(1) The present surveillance operation should be intensified and
                            increased surveillance of waterborne traffic from Cambodia should be
                            instituted.</p>
                        <p>(2) Air attack should be intensified against land infiltration routes in
                            Laos and border areas of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, to include
                            attacks on lines of communication (roads and bridges, depots, truck
                            parks, bivouacs and rest areas), attack of vehicles and of troop units
                            in movement or deployed for security of the <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>. Intelligence efforts should be intensified and
                            restrictions removed (e.g., defoliation should be experimented with),
                            with the object of determining route locations and gaining timely
                            information on vehicle and troop movements.</p>
                        <p>(3) Ground action should be undertaken against land infiltration in Laos
                            and <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, expanding operations toward an
                            effective barrier as experience is gained and capability is developed.
                            As feasible, blocking positions should be established, supplies seized
                            or destroyed, and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> route security forces harassed or
                            destroyed.</p>
                        <p>c. Military operations in South Vietnam. The object is to put <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            battalion forces out of operation, i.e., to destroy them or cause their
                            disintegration as fighting forces capable of interfering with <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> pacification (territorial security)
                            operations. Basing action primarily on offensive land and air operations
                            of US, <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> and third-country forces,
                            the concept is to locate and destroy <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> forces, bases and
                            war-supporting organizations in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. For
                            the present, the area of such operations will be the zones of the I
                            Corps and the II Corps, and the northern portion of the III Corps zone,
                            with initial priority of effort to those areas most critical to the
                            success of the offensive. Concentrations of VC forces should be
                            aggressively sought out and attacked by mobile land forces employed in
                            coordination with air forces utilized for close support operations or
                            for general preparatory attack. Maximum effort will be made to avoid
                            piecemeal reaction to <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> attacks, thus
                            exposing forces to ambush, and instead to place primary emphasis on
                            launching coordinated attacks to destroy <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> units. Maximum effort should be applied to monitoring
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> activities, employing all
                            intelligence techniques, to include indigenous sources as well as more
                            sophisticated surveillance techniques, including large-scale,
                            light-plane spotter activity.</p>
                        <p>10. The concept of tactical operations for the offensive within <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> is, at the present time, the heart of
                            this problem, and the uncertainties that exist must be squarely
                            recognized and acknowledged. With limited and local exceptions, the
                            course of the war to date in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> does
                            not provide experience directly approximating what is now visualized.
                            Lacking such operations, we cannot assert with certainty that tactics
                            can be devised and operations conducted that will, in fact, put the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> battalions out of operation and keep them so.
                            Nevertheless, several avenues of operation which are available permit a
                            high order of confidence that such can be achieved:</p>
                        <p>a. Operations to locate and attack <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> units to destroy
                            them or render them ineffective as fighting units.</p>
                        <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186" facs="0218"/>
                        <p>b. Operations to clear and occupy the base areas from which <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> units
                            operate and are supported.</p>
                        <p>c. Operations to establish major areas of strength, for example, in the
                            central highlands or other major infiltration avenues, to interdict
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> support for the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>11. Closely connected with the foregoing concepts is a further assumption
                            not previously stated: recognizing that it is necessary both to put the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> battalion-size units out of operation, and to provide
                            security to the territory and the people of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> if we are to win, it is assumed that if the US, <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and third countries succeed in
                            accomplishing the former, the <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> with
                            no more than advisory assistance and limited support from the US can
                            achieve and maintain the latter. These assumptions appear reasonable,
                            but they warrant closer study by our top commanders and officials in
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>12. The heavy preponderance of force required for this strategy can only
                            be achieved with substantial additional US and third-country ground
                            forces. Forces adequate to initiate such a strategy can be provided from
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> forces plus the 44 battalions of
                            US and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces under consideration
                            for deployment within the next few months. These should be able to
                            establish superiority and turn the tide of battle in favor of the
                                US/<gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. Whether they will be enough
                            to sustain the offensive to achieve the “winning outcome,” or whether
                            such a result will require the commitment of further US and
                            third-country forces, is a question that cannot be answered at this
                            time. It is dependent in part on whether the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> introduces added forces into <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, upon the evolving total requirement as the number of
                            surviving <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> battalions declines, and upon the ability of the <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> to shift added forces to this role as
                            such a decline occurs. Rough estimates suggest, however, that additional
                            forces amounting to 7-35 further battalions could prove to be required,
                            depending upon whether the US/<gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                            operation can be limited to a zone such as that of the I, II, and III
                            Corps, or must be extended to cover the delta region as well.</p>
                        <p>13. A parallel increase in tactical air forces is also required. Several
                            months will be required to deploy the added ground forces and commit
                            them to combat, and it is appropriate to phase in the tactical air for
                            close air support on a comparable schedule, thus permitting earlier
                            concentration on the air campaign against <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>—as is tactically desirable in any event. On this basis,
                            a requirement is foreseen for the 4 additional squadrons now planned as
                            soon as bases are available, for 6 to 9 additional squadrons within the
                            remainder of this year, and for a substantial increase in the B-52 force
                            available in the Western Pacific for conventional operations. Analysis
                            of capabilities for rapid building of additional air fields, employing
                            aluminum matting, indicates that additional bases adequate for at least
                            9 of these 10 to 13 squadrons can be made operationally ready by the end
                            of this year.</p>
                        <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0219"/>
                        <p>14. The end results that can be expected to be achieved in <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>, along the infiltration routes, and in
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> through taking action along the
                            lines presented in this study are estimated to be as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. Air operations against <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>. The
                            stepped-up program of air strikes should reduce in major degree the
                            ability of the <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> to support the
                            insurgency in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s, <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>s,
                            and <gloss target="#t_IL281">IL-28</gloss>s can be effectively
                            eliminated. By attacks against the planned target system, particularly
                                <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> and railroads, roads, and
                            waterways, together with mining of harbors, the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> will be sharply limited in their ability to support
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> forces in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> at the
                            intensified level of combat envisaged, and will in particular be limited
                            in their capability to reinforce the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            with effective units of division size.</p>
                        <p>b. Attack against infiltration routes. When the intensity of combat
                            operations in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> is raised to the
                            extent envisaged and the logistical requirements for <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            forces have been correspondingly increased, the combination of more
                            effective surveillance of sea routes, together with air and ground
                            action against the routes through Laos, should materially limit the
                            ability of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> forces to move personnel and supplies to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, and to withstand the pressure of
                            attacks within <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. One effect will be
                            the delay of overt introduction of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            forces into <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> by requiring such
                            movement to be conducted at reduced march rates over long distances.</p>
                        <p>c. Military operations in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. Presently
                            organized and planned <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces, except
                            for reserve battalions (possibly including a limited number of ranger
                            and infantry battalions), would retain control over areas now held,
                            extend pacification operations and area control where permitted by the
                            progress of major offensive operations, defend critical installations
                            and areas against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> attack and seek out
                            and eliminate <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> militia units. US,
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, and third-country forces, by
                            offensive land and air action, would locate and destroy <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            forces, bases and major war-supporting organizations in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. The cumulative effect of sustained,
                            aggressive conduct of offensive operations, coupled with the
                            interdiction of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> efforts to provide
                            the higher level of support required in such a combat environment,
                            should lead to progressive destruction of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> main force
                            battalions.</p>

                            McNamara expressed very strong feeling that there would be resentment
                            among the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> if junior officers were
                            brought over while they were not. This does no immediate damage. I
                            understand that <persName corresp="#p_GLGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName> has
                            very interesting views of his own, and I will try to have a private talk
                            with him in the next 24 hours.</p>
                        <p>3. The military recommendations, as usual, are in pretty good order. On
                            the political side, we have hard problems, also as usual. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> have a disagreement on how far we should have a
                            “peace offensive.” This difference may turn out to be more apparent than
                            real.</p>
                        <p>4. There is also a major political problem of U.S. leadership in Saigon
                            below the level of the Ambassador. My own view is that the solution is
                            to get not one but two outstanding deputies—Bill Sullivan and Frank
                            Meloy. <persName corresp="#p_MFEJ1">Meloy</persName> can run the
                            ordinary Embassy work, and I think <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> can coordinate the pacification activities in a
                            way in which no one else in government can. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> is no administrator—a fact which both <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CCL1">Chet Cooper</persName> report as fully confirmed
                            from this trip.</p>
                        <p>To give him two deputies is abnormal—but Vietnam is not normal. A little
                            heat from you on the State Department would help, although my brother
                                <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName> is already

                            been concurred in by <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>, <pb n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0222"/>

                            had not—he did not seek or receive their concurrence.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>: If I thought a diplomatic
                            move would be successful, I would be for it. Now, it would harden the
                            enemy. This is not the time to do it. Clarifying objectives is good for
                            the world public, but not necessary for governments. They understand
                            it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Seems to me our
                            call-up and increase in budget is evidence that we are not taking over
                            North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>M. Bundy: Our public utterances will make it clear that we are not trying
                            to take over North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Our public actions
                            must do this. We must show that we are not in with <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>'s objective to invade <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>. We are building such a force that
                                <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> might think that is what we are
                            trying to do.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>: Remember this “on to
                                <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>” movement is part of a
                            propaganda move and nothing more.</p>
                        <p>M. Bundy: Isn't it true that most of the diplomatic moves come from other
                            nations rather than the U.S. (in rebuttal to <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>'s hard position).</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: This is exactly what I
                            am talking about.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>: The President has done a
                            remarkable job of forming public opinion so far. Very skillful.</p>
                        <p>M. Bundy: Are there divergences between <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and US in troop use?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> wants us to use troops in the
                            highlands. This is unacceptable to us. While <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> originally recommended this, they are now in agreement
                            with us.</p>
                        <p>Rusk: What is the capability of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to
                            mobilize their own forces?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: They are trying to
                            increase by 10,000 per month. Our country team is optimistic. I am not.
                            Desertion rate is high. They say it is lessening, but I do not agree. We
                            did not find any thread of discontent among our troops. U.S. morale is
                            of the highest order. Proud of their dedication and devotion. It
                            reflects the belief they are doing something worthwhile.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: Agree. Advisors are
                            pleased with Vietnamese. They speak very highly of Vietnamese common
                            soldier. Officer corps very different. Some officers are not of highest
                            quality. Not total however. Weakness in <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>'s forces are lack of adequate officer corps—in their
                            training and attitude—but they are getting better.</p>
                        <p>Rusk: Any summary of enemy troubles?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: No, nothing more than
                            we already know. They are suffering heavy losses. They are well supplied
                            with ammunition. I suspect much of inflow of supplies is water-borne.
                            Only part of our action that is unsatisfactory is our patrol of the
                            seashore. But even if we did have tight control, it should make little
                            difference in the next six to nine months.</p>
                        <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0223"/>
                        <p>Rusk: What is the timing on how we should proceed?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: There ought to be a
                            statement to the American people no later than a week.</p>
                        <p>Bundy: It is quite possible the message to Congress will be a message to
                            the public.</p>
                        <p>Rusk: We ought to get civilians in the Congressional testimony to abuse
                            [disabuse] the feeling that the military is making the decisions.</p>
                        <p>Bundy: Perhaps Rusk should follow up the President's speech with
                            statement of total unanimity.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: It is one thing to ready
                            the country for this decision and another to face the realities of the
                            decision. We can't allow the country to wake up one morning and find
                            heavy casualties. We need to be damn serious with the American
                            public.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: We discussed the
                            command arrangements—they are to be left as they are—parallel
                            commands.</p>
                        <p>The President entered the meeting at 11:30 am</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: To support an
                            additional 200,000 troops in <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> by first
                            of the year the reserves in the US should be reconstituted by like
                            amount. I recommend calling up 235,000 a year from now, replace the
                            reserves with regulars.</p>
                        <p>In mid-1966 we would have approximately 600,000 additional men.</p>
                        <p>President: What has happened in recent past that requires this decision
                            on my part? What are the alternatives? Also, I want more discussions on
                            what we expect to flow from this decision. Discuss in detail.</p>
                        <p>Have we wrung every single soldier out of every country we can? Who else
                            can help? Are we the sole defenders of freedom in the world? Have we
                            done all we can in this direction? The reasons for the call up? The
                            results we can expect? What are the alternatives? We must make no snap
                            judgments. We must consider carefully all our options.</p>
                        <p>We know we can tell <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> “we're coming
                            home.” Is that the option we should take? What flows from that.</p>
                        <p>The negotiations, the pause, all the other approaches—have all been
                            explored. It makes us look weak—with cup in hand. We have tried.</p>
                        <p>Let's look at all our options so that every man at this table understands
                            fully the total picture.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: This is our position a

                            <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> tactics are terror, and sniping.</p>

                        <p>President: Looks dangerous to put US forces in those red areas.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: You're right. We're

                            <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: Yes, but by constantly
                            harassing them, they will have to fight somewhere.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: If <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> doesn't fight in large units, it will
                            give <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> a chance to re-secure hostile
                            areas.</p>
                        <p>We don't know what <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> tactics will be when
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> is confronted by 175,000
                            Americans.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName>: We agree—by 1965, we
                            expect <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> will increase their forces.
                            They will attempt to gain a substantial victory before our build-up is
                            complete.</p>
                        <p>President: Is anyone of the opinion we should not do what the memo
                            says—If so, I'd like to hear from them.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: I can foresee a perilous
                            voyage—very dangerous—great apprehensions that we can win under these
                            conditions. But, let me be clear, if the decision is to go ahead, I'm
                            committed.</p>
                        <p>President: But is there another course in the national interest that is
                            better than the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> course?
                            We know it's dangerous and perilous. But can it be avoided?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: There is no course that
                            will allow us to cut our losses. If we get bogged down, our cost might
                            be substantially greater. The pressures to create a larger war would be
                            irresistible. Qualifications I have are not due to the fact that I think
                            we are in a bad moral position.</p>
                        <p>President: What other road can I go?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: Take what precautions we
                            can—take losses—let their government fall apart—negotiate—probable take
                            over by Communists. This is disagreeable, I know.</p>
                        <p>President: Can we make a case for this—discuss it fully?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: We have discussed it. I
                            have had my day in court.</p>
                        <p>President: I don't think we have made a full commitment. You have pointed
                            out the danger, but you haven't proposed an alternative course. We
                            haven't always been right. We have no mortgage on victory.</p>
                        <p>I feel we have very little alternative to what we are doing.</p>
                        <p>I want another meeting before we take this action. We should look at all
                            other courses carefully. Right now I feel it would be more dangerous for
                            us to lose this now, than endanger a greater number of troops.</p>

                        <p>Rusk: What we have done since 1954-61 has not been good enough. We should
                            have probably committed ourselves heavier in 1961.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RC1">Rowan</persName>: What bothers me most is the
                            weakness of the <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> government.
                            Unless we put the screws on the <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>
                            government, 175,000 men will do us no good.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>: There is no tradition of
                            a national government in Saigon. There are no roots in the country. Not
                            until there is tranquility can you have any stability. I don't think we
                            ought to take this government seriously. There is no one who can do
                            anything. We have to do what we think we ought to do regardless of what
                            the Saigon government does.</p>
                        <p>As we move ahead on a new phase—it gives us the right and duty to do
                            certain things with or without the government's approval.</p>
                        <p>President: George, do you think we have another course?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: I would not recommend that
                            you follow <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s
                            course.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">President</hi>: Are you able to outline your
                            doubts—and offer another course of action? I think it is desirable to
                            hear you out—and determine if your suggestions are sound and ready to be
                            followed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: Yes. I think I can present
                            to you the least bad of two courses. What I would present is a course
                            that is costly, but can be limited to short term costs.</p>
                        <p>President: Then, let's meet at 2:30 this afternoon to discuss <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s proposals. Now let Bob tell us
                            why we need to risk those 600,000 lives.</p>
                        <p>(<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> outlined the reasons for more
                            troops.) 75,000 now just enough to protect bases—it will let us lose
                            slowly instead of rapidly. The extra men will stabilize the situation
                            and improve it. It will give <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            breathing room. We limit it to another 100,000 because <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> can't absorb any more. There is no major
                            risk of catastrophe.</p>
                        <p>President: But you will lose greater number of men.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: The more men we have
                            the greater the likelihood of smaller losses.</p>
                        <p>President: What makes you think if we put in 100,000 men <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> won't put in another
                            100,000?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: This means greater
                            bodies of men—which will allow us to cream them.</p>
                        <p>President: What are the chances of more <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> men coming?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: 50-50 chance. He would
                            be foolhardy to put 1/4 of his forces in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. It would expose him too greatly in <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>President: (to <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName>) Do you
                            have people in <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>?</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName>: Not enough. We think it
                            is reliable.</p>
                        <p>President: Can't we improve intelligence in <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>?</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: We can't win. Long
                            protracted. The most we can hope for is messy conclusion. There remains
                            a great danger of intrusion by <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss>s.</p>
                        <p>Problem of long war in US:</p>
                        <p>1. Korean experience was galling one. Correlation between Korean
                            casualties and public opinion (<persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> showed Pres. a chart)<note n="5" xml:id="d71fn5">Not further identified. </note> showed support stabilized at 50%.
                            As casualties increase, pressure to strike at jugular of the <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> will become very great.</p>
                        <p>2. World opinion. If we could win in a year's time—win decisively—world
                            opinion would be alright. However, if long and protracted we will suffer
                            because a great power cannot beat guerrillas.</p>
                        <p>3. National politics. Every great captain in history is not afraid to
                            make a tactical withdrawal if conditions are unfavorable to him. The
                            enemy cannot even be seen; he is indigenous to the country.</p>
                        <p>Have serious doubt if an army of westerners can fight orientals in Asian
                            jungle and succeed.</p>
                        <p>President: This is important—can westerners, in absence of intelligence,
                            successfully fight orientals in jungle rice-paddies? I want <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> to seriously ponder this
                            question.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: I think we have all
                            underestimated the seriousness of this situation. Like giving cobalt
                            treatment to a terminal cancer case. I think a long protracted war will
                            disclose our weakness, not our strength.</p>
                        <p>The least harmful way to cut losses in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> is to let the government decide it doesn't want us to
                            stay there. Therefore, put such proposals to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> government that they can't accept, then it would move
                            into a neutralist position—and I have no illusions that after we were
                            asked to leave, <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> would be under Hanoi
                            control.</p>
                        <p>What about Thailand? It would be our main problem. Thailand has proven a
                            good ally so far—though history shows it has never been a staunch ally.
                            If we wanted to make a stand in Thailand, we might be able to make
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Another problem would be South Korea. We have two divisions there now.
                            There would be a problem with Taiwan, but as long as Generalissimo is
                            there, they have no place to go. Indonesia is a problem—insofar as
                            Malaysia. There we might have to help the British in military way. <pb n="195" xml:id="pg_195" facs="0227"/>Japan thinks we are propping up
                            a lifeless government and are on a sticky wicket. Between long war and
                            cutting our losses, the Japanese would go for the latter (all this on
                            Japan according to Reischauer).</p>
                        <p>President: Wouldn't all those countries say Uncle Sam is a paper
                            tiger—wouldn't we lose credibility breaking the word of three
                            presidents—if we set it up as you proposed. It would seem to be an
                            irreparable blow. But, I gather you don't think so.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: The worse blow would be
                            that the mightiest power in the world is unable to defeat
                            guerrillas.</p>
                        <p>President: Then you are not basically troubled by what the world would
                            say about pulling out?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: If we were actively helping
                            a country with a stable, viable government, it would be a vastly
                            different story. Western Europeans look at us as if we got ourselves
                            into an imprudent fashion [situation].</p>
                        <p>President: But I believe that these people are trying to fight. They're
                            like Republicans who try to stay in power, but don't stay there
                            long.</p>

                            B. Bundy, <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>—all said they
                            didn't believe it.)</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> will fall soon. He is weak. We can't
                            have elections until there is physical security, and even then there
                            will be no elections because as Cabot said, there is no democratic
                            tradition. (<persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> agreed about
                                <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>—but said <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName> impressed him)</p>
                        <p>President: Two basic troublings:</p>
                        <p>1. That Westerners can ever win in Asia.</p>
                        <p>2. Don't see how you can fight a war under direction of other people
                            whose government changes every month.</p>
                        <p>Now go ahead, George, and make your other points.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: The cost, as well as our
                            Western European allies, is not relevant to their situation. What they
                            are concerned about is their own security—troops in Berlin have real
                            meaning, none in <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>President: Are you saying pulling out of Korea would be akin to pulling
                            out of Vietnam?</p>
                        <p>Bundy: It is not analogous. We had a status quo in Korea. It would not be
                            that way in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: We will pay a higher cost
                            in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>This is a decision one makes against an alternative.</p>
                        <pb n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0228"/>
                        <p>On one hand—long protracted war, costly, <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> is digging in for long term. This is their life and
                            driving force. Chinese are taking long term view—ordering blood plasma
                            from Japan.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand—short-term losses. On balance, come out ahead of
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> plan. Distasteful
                            on either hand.</p>
                        <p>Bundy: Two important questions to be raised—I agree with the main thrust
                            of <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. It is the function
                            of my staff to argue both sides.</p>
                        <p>To <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s argument: The difficulty
                            in adopting it now would be a radical switch without evidence that it
                            should be done. It goes in the face of all we have said and done.</p>
                        <p>His whole analytical argument gives no weight to loss suffered by other
                            side. A great many elements in his argument are correct.</p>
                        <p>We need to make clear this is a somber matter—that it will not be
                            quick—no single action will bring quick victory.</p>
                        <p>I think it is clear that we are not going to be thrown out.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: My problem is not that we
                            don't get thrown out, but that we get bogged down and don't win.</p>
                        <p>Bundy: I would sum up: The world, the country, and the <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> would have alarming reactions if we got
                            out.</p>
                        <p>Rusk: If the Communist world finds out we will not pursue our commitment
                            to the end, I don't know where they will stay their hand.</p>
                        <p>I am more optimistic than some of my colleagues. I don't believe the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have made large advances among the
                                <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> people.</p>
                        <p>We can't worry about massive casualties when we say we can't find the
                            enemy. I don't see great casualties unless the Chinese come in.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>: There is a greater threat
                            to World War III if we don't go in. Similarity to our indolence at
                            Munich.</p>
                        <p>I can't be as pessimistic as Ball. We have great seaports in Vietnam. We
                            don't need to fight on roads. We have the sea. Visualize our meeting
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> on our own terms. We don't have to
                            spend all our time in the jungles.</p>
                        <p>If we can secure their bases, the <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> can
                            secure, in time, a political movement to (1) apprehend the terrorist and
                            (2) give intelligence to the government.</p>
                        <p>The procedures for this are known.</p>
                        <p>I agree that the Japanese agitators don't like what we are doing but Sato
                            is totally in agreement with our actions.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> have been dealt more casualties
                            than, per capita, we suffered in the Civil War. The <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> soldier is an uncomplaining soldier. He
                            has ideas he will die for.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>: I agree this is what we
                            have to do. We have spotted some things we want to pay attention to.</p>

                        <p>President: How can we get everybody to compete with <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> in the press? We are trying
                            to do so many other things with our economic and health projects.
                            Constantly remind the people that we are doing other things besides

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> noted that the
                            only Section of his report which contained specific action
                            recommendations and the only one fully coordinated with the principals
                            (Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>, Ambassador
                            Johnson, General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>,
                            General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>, and Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>) was paragraph 5. The
                            four key recommendations follow:</p>
                        <p>1. The deployment of US ground troops in Vietnam be increased by October
                            to 34 maneuver battalions (or, if the Koreans fail to provide the
                            expected 9 battalions promptly, to 43 battalions). The
                            battalions—together with increases in other units, would bring the total
                            US personnel <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0230"/>in Vietnam to
                            approximately 175,000 (200,000 if we must make up for the Korean
                            failure).</p>
                        <p>2. Congress be requested to authorize the call-up of approximately
                            235,000 men in the Reserve and National Guard. This number would provide
                            approximately 36 maneuver battalions by the end of this year.</p>
                        <p>3. The regular armed forces be increased by approximately 375,000 men
                            (approximately 250,000 Army, 75,000 Marines, 25,000 Air Force and 25,000
                            Navy). This would provide approximately 27 additional maneuver
                            battalions by the middle of 1966.</p>
                        <p>4. A supplemental appropriation of approximately $X for FY 1966 be sought
                            from the Congress to cover the first part of the added costs
                            attributable to the buildup in and for the war in Vietnam. A further
                            supplemental appropriation might be required later in the Fiscal
                            Year.</p>
                        <p>Although no attempt was made to coordinate the remainder of the paper,
                            the comments of other members of the group were solicited. No attempt
                            was made to resolve certain shades of difference, but Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>'s concerns about early
                            political moves to obtain a negotiated settlement (paragraphs 4c and 9)
                            were recorded in footnotes.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> emphasized that
                            his concern with respect to political moves was basically on the matter
                            of timing. He also felt that channels of communication with the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            already exist.</p>
                        <p>McGeorge Bundy noted that such questions of the “liberation” of North
                            Vietnam could be handled in our public utterances. As far as
                            “negotiations” were concerned, third countries could be relied on to
                            keep initiatives going. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> observed that the contemplated size of our
                            forces and bases in South Vietnam could well give Hanoi the impression
                            that we had the intention of “marching North.” Hanoi, Peiping, and
                            Moscow should be made aware that this was not our intent.</p>
                        <p>In a response to a series of questions from Secretary Rusk, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> doubted that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could raise the necessary forces
                            to counter increasing <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> capabilities
                            (the country team was more optimistic, but we would be prudent to take a
                            pessimistic and skeptical view of the abilities of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>—“a non-government”—to push forward with
                            any major program); morale of US forces was excellent (General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> heartily agreed); the monsoon
                            offensive was under way and “there was more to come;” the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> lacked the capability to seize any of the
                            major US bases, or Saigon.</p>
                        <p>In connection with <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> logistics, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> indicated that,
                            although there was little information available, <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> supplies appeared to be adequate. Both he and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> felt that much of
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> supplies were coming in by sea.
                            Our capability to interdict sea supply was inadequate. This, and the
                            lack of tactical intelligence (“POW <pb n="199" xml:id="pg_199" facs="0231"/>interrogations must be tightened up”) were the two most
                            important operational problems we faced.</p>
                        <p>The seeking out of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> main force units was
                            generally regarded as a high priority matter. To a considerable extent
                            this reflected the gaps in intelligence. General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> pointed out that small
                                US-<gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> “foraging teams” operating
                            primarily in the Delta, attempt to locate <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> units.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Rusk stated that, if the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> report was accepted, a scenario for
                            Congressional and public actions would be desirable. There was a general
                            feeling that the President would have to move ahead on statements to
                            Congress and the public early in the week of July 26. Although there was
                            already a widespread expectation that we would be expanding our forces
                            in Vietnam, the key question involved calling up reserves.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Rusk felt that it was important that the new military proposals
                            have civilian (i.e., State Department) endorsement. He thought he should
                            participate in the Congressional testimony. Mr. Bundy suggested that the
                            Congressional presentation should be a <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> responsibility and that Mr. Rusk should participate in
                            the follow-up presentation to the public. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> pointed out the need to paint “a
                            sombre picture” and to dispel any idea that the post-monsoon period
                            would see us over the hump. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> felt that we should make it clear to the public
                            that American troops were already in combat.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Meeting with the President—11:30</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bundy suggested an agenda for the discussion to follow:</p>
                        <p>1. The Action Recommendations (para. 5 of <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> report)</p>
                        <p>2. The political situation and prospects in Vietnam</p>
                        <p>3. The basic diplomatic position</p>
                        <p>4. A scenario of action</p>
                        <p>The President stressed the need for utmost care to avoid any leaks or
                            speculation on the subjects under discussion.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> summarized his
                            recommendations.</p>
                        <p>The President indicated that, when the time came to call up the reserves,
                            he wanted a full statement of the situation in Vietnam which required
                            additional US troops. What consequences are likely to flow from a
                            call-up? (The <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> paper
                            gives no sense of victory, but rather of continuing stalemate.) Why
                            can't we get more third country troops? What are the alternatives
                            available to us? We could tell the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            that we are leaving, but is this an option we wish to pursue at this
                            time? If we pull out of Vietnam now, will we have to call up more troops
                            and suffer more casualties at some later date? We have explored all
                            initiatives for a peaceful settlement, to an extent, perhaps, that we
                            might already look weak. In short, what are our present options, why do
                            we select the recommended <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0232"/>number of troops rather than more or fewer? What will this increased
                            force accomplish?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> discussed the
                            deterioration in the situation: The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            has greatly expanded its control of the country, populous areas are now
                            isolated, both the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> have been suffering heavy casualties.
                            Unless the US steps in with additional forces, the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> will push the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> into small enclaves and become increasingly
                            ineffective. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> now controls about 25
                            percent of the population (<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Director
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName> estimated that the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> controlled about 25 percent of the
                            population during the day and about 50 percent at night). A year ago,
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> controlled less than 20
                            percent.</p>
                        <p>The President felt that our mission should be as limited as we dare make
                            it.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> agreed, but felt
                            that we should engage in offensive operations to seek out and fight
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> main force units. Although this is
                            difficult because of the lack of tactical intelligence, we know where
                            these base areas are.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName> reported the
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s estimate that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> will avoid major confrontations with US
                            forces and concentrate on destroying our <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>s and on guerrilla warfare, generally.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> felt that the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> will have to “come out and fight”
                            and that this will probably take place in the highlands where they will
                            probably attempt to establish a government seat. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> thought, however, that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> might not “accommodate” us by moving in
                            “Phase III” operations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> felt that if the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> did not choose to fight in large units, the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> could proceed with pacification
                            activities and consolidate its oil spots. We don't know what the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> will do when confronted with 175,000 US
                            forces, but they probably will contrive to use their main force units in
                            large concentrations until they get badly mauled (probably by the first
                            part of 1966). At the moment, terrorism is low in terms of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> capabilities. US forces can engage
                            guerrillas as well as the main force units.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName> believed that the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> will attempt to achieve a decisive victory in the next
                            six months. In response to the President's query as to the likelihood of
                            this, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated that
                            this was highly improbable.</p>
                        <p>The President asked if there were any dissents from the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> recommendations. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> felt that we were
                            engaged on “a very perilous voyage.” He had grave apprehensions about
                            our ability to beat the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> because of the
                            nature of the terrain, the softness of the political situation and other
                            factors. However, he would go along with the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> report. The President
                            indicated that he was aware of the dangers, but wondered about other
                            courses open to us.</p>
                        <pb n="201" xml:id="pg_201" facs="0233"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> stated that he could not
                            offer a course that would permit us to “cut our losses” easily. But we
                            should weigh the costs of cutting our losses now as opposed to later.
                            The pressures to move toward a larger war would be “almost
                            irresistible.” He based his views not on a “moral” position but on a
                            “cold-blooded calculation.” We will have to take the risk of Southeast
                            Asia becoming Communist. However, he believed that the losses would be
                            of a short-term nature.</p>
                        <p>The President felt that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                            clearly identified the dangers before us, but did not get the impression
                            that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> opposes the
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> course. The
                            President wanted to minimize the dangers of this enterprise but felt
                            that he had no other choice. He would seriously like to explore other
                            alternatives, now or as we proceed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rusk agreed that alternative options should be explored. He felt,
                            however, that if we had met the challenge posed in 1961 by sending
                            “50,000 men” to South Vietnam, Hanoi may have hesitated to proceed with
                            its actions against the South.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RC1">Rowan</persName> indicated he would go
                            along with the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            proposal, but was worried about the prospects for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> stability (page 3 of the report).
                            Unless we can achieve stability, our forces will be severely
                            handicapped.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> pointed out that we
                            cannot count on stability in South Vietnam. Saigon has no roots in the
                            countryside and needs peace to rule the country. In any case, if there
                            were a strong stable government there wouldn't be a war. “We shouldn't
                            take the Government too seriously.” If the area is important to us, we
                            must do what is necessary regardless of the Government.</p>
                        <p>The President asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> to
                            present his alternative proposal in detail at a meeting in the
                            afternoon.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> proceeded to develop
                            his option: In essence the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> now had the
                            capability to push <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> out of
                            positions they now control with a consequent inevitable takeover of the
                            Government. He would not recommend that we hold our forces at the
                            present level. We should increase our forces or get out. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> pointed out that the
                                <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> strength had sharply declined
                            because of casualties and desertions. With increased US forces we will
                            have proportionately less casualties. He could not assure the President,
                            however, that an additional 100,000 men would be sufficient.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President's query why Hanoi couldn't match US man for
                            man, General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> indicated
                            that large-scale <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> forces would be a
                            favorable development for us. He felt that the <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> would be unlikely to put more than 25 percent of its
                            own forces into South Vietnam (Note: the <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> consists of approximately 250,000 troops). Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName> stated that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s estimate was that Hanoi would send
                            20-25,000 <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> troops into South
                            Vietnam by the end of the year.</p>
                        <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0234"/>
                        <p>The President urged the <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> to increase
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s capabilities for intelligence
                            collection in the North. Anything that was needed to accomplish this
                            would be made available. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stressed the need to increase combat
                            intelligence as well (<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> J-2 were working on this
                            problem).</p>
                        <p>The President indicated his deep concern about press stories from Saigon
                            that US forces were bombing innocent civilians. These followed a general
                            discussion on the overall press situation with the President urging
                            State Department officials to work on the matter.</p>
                        <p>The President closed this session with a request to Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and McGeorge Bundy constantly to
                            explore alternatives to proposed policies. The session adjourned at 1:00
                            p.m.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Afternoon Session—2:30</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> developed the details of
                            his policy alternative. He was basically skeptical of the ability of
                            Westerners successfully to wage war on the terrain and in the political
                            atmosphere of Vietnam. If the war could be won in a year with reasonable
                            casualties, he would not be so concerned. But he feels that it will take
                            at least two years and the fact that we will have put in so much US
                            manpower with no early definitive results, would be a sign of US
                            weakness in the eyes of the world. The fact that our tactical
                            intelligence is so poor indicates the unfavorable political atmosphere
                            in Vietnam. We have underestimated the seriousness of the problem since
                            we started there. And we are still underestimating the seriousness of
                            the situation. “It is like giving cobalt treatment to a terminal cancer
                            case.” The least harmful way to cut our losses is to let the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> decide it doesn't want us. He has no
                            illusions about the consequences of this in Vietnam or in Southeast
                            Asia. He reviewed these consequences in detail, but felt that in the
                            long run they would be less serious than they might appear at first.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed that the situation is serious. He regretted that we
                            were embroiled in Vietnam. But we are there. He believes the Vietnamese
                            people want us there, despite the frequent changes of government. In
                            response to the President's query, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> indicated his poor impression of General
                                <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>, and his belief that the
                            present <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would be removed by the end
                            of the year. General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>
                            stated that he had a good impression of General <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName>. He felt that the stability of
                            the present government would depend on our support.</p>
                        <p>The President stressed his concern about the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s instability. He noted two basic problems:</p>
                        <p>1. Can Westerners engage in a war in Vietnam?</p>
                        <p>2. How can we fight a war under a government that changes so
                            frequently?</p>
                        <pb n="203" xml:id="pg_203" facs="0235"/>
                        <p>Mr. Bundy agreed with the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> proposals. He felt that no government which
                            could hold power is likely to be one that will invite us to leave. The
                            basic lesson of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s view
                            is that:</p>
                        <p>1. The post-monsoon season will not see us in the clear.</p>
                        <p>2. No single speech will be sufficient to reassure the American
                            people.</p>
                        <p>We will have to face up to the serious, ominous implications of our new
                            policy. This is not a continuation of our present approach. “We are
                            asking Americans to bet more to achieve less.” We will have to engage in
                            a much more massive political and economic effort. New organizational
                            changes may be necessary in our mission in Saigon and in our
                            governmental structure in Washington. There are no early victories in
                            store, although early casualties are likely to be heavy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bundy did not believe that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s “cancer analogy” was a good one. Immaturity and
                            weakness, yes. A non-Communist society is struggling to be born. Before
                            we take our decision to the American people, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> should go back to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and get greater, more positive
                            assurances. There will be time to decide our policy won't work after we
                            have given it a good try. (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> disagreed here, feeling that the larger our
                            commitment, the more difficult would be the decision to get out. “We
                            won't get out; we'll double our bet and get lost in the rice
                            paddies.”)</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bundy felt that the kind of shift in US policy suggested by Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> would be “disastrous”.
                            He would rather maintain our present commitment and “waffle through”
                            than withdraw. The country is in the mood to accept grim news.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Rusk emphasized that the nature and integrity of the US
                            commitment was fundamental. It makes the US stance with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> creditable. It would be dangerous if
                            the Communist leadership became convinced that we will not see this
                            through. It is more important to convince the Communist leadership of
                            this than to worry about the opinion of non-Communist countries. He is
                            more optimistic about the outcome of the war than some. The effects of
                            our force increment will be to force the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> into guerrilla activity, to remove the capability of the
                            other side to use major forces against the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> must now be
                            faced with difficult decisions. An increased US commitment does not
                            change the nature of the war—we have already gone a long way in the air
                            and on the ground without escalating. Consequently, he wondered whether
                            we should be too dramatic about the increase in US forces. (Mr. Bundy
                            pointed out here that calling up the reserves will require a certain
                            amount of “drama”.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> felt that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> understated the cost of
                            cutting our losses. He agreed with Mr. Rusk on the international effect
                            of such an action at this time. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> also overstates the cost of his (<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s) <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0236"/>proposal. He agreed that it would take
                            at least two years to pacify the country and we must be prepared to
                            increase our forces by another 100,000.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> said that it was
                            unreasonable to expect to “win” in a year regardless of the number of US
                            troops involved. We might start to reverse the unfavorable trend in a
                            year and make definite progress in three years.</p>
                        <p>The President wondered whether we could win without using nuclear weapons
                            if China entered the war.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> felt we could in
                            “Southeast Asia.” He believes US forces can operate in the terrain of
                            Southeast Asia. This is the first “war of National Liberation”; if we
                            walk out of this one, we will just have to face others.</p>
                        <p>The President asked why, when we have been undertaking military efforts
                            for 20 months, this new effort will be successful. General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> felt that our additional
                            forces will stave off a deteriorating situation.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> disagreed with
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s approach. He felt,
                            however, that it was essential to get a political/civil program
                            going.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> agreed with
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> proposal. He found
                            no unfavorable reactions in South Vietnam to an increase in US
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>The President raised again the problem of getting more economic/political
                            information into the press. State Department representatives promised to
                            give this increased attention.</p>
                        <p>The President stressed his desire to get more third country troops into
                            South Vietnam. He also raised the possibility of a Vietnam Task Force
                            which would meet daily.</p>
                        <p>The meeting adjourned at 5:30.</p>

                            is not an alternative but rather an ancillary approach.</p>

                        <p>This morning's discussion<note n="3" xml:id="d73fn3">See <ref target="#d71">Documents 71</ref> and <ref target="#d72">72</ref>.</note> noted two possible military outcomes resulting
                            from a substantial increase in US forces:</p>
                        <p>a. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> main forces will be forced by US
                            forces into reverting to guerrilla warfare.</p>
                        <p>b. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> main forces will choose not to
                            confront our units head-on and voluntarily revert to guerrilla
                            actions.</p>
                        <p>Either way, it would appear that we and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will be faced with the problem of guerrilla rather than
                            positional warfare. The fact that this may mean that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> cannot achieve a military victory offers
                            small comfort; neither we nor the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            have as yet demonstrated that we can win this kind of war. The idea of
                            leaving “pacification” duties to the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> (while we defend our bases and come to the relief of
                            besieged <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units) will not, in
                            itself, do the trick. In effect, the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            will be doing what it is best at. What is needed, if we are successfully
                            to cope with the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> under the
                            circumstances of widespread guerrilla warfare, is a
                            political-economic-psychwar program as carefully developed and as
                            massive in its way as the military effort envisaged in the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> proposal. In fact, it may
                            well be that many of the US forces would be redundant under these
                            circumstances and our hopes for “a favorable outcome” will be dependent
                            on the success of our non-military efforts.</p>
                        <p>In brief, I would recommend that if the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> proposals are accepted, there be developed
                            simultaneously a major non-military program to deal with the guerrilla
                            phase of the war. In fact, I do not see how the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> approach can succeed without
                            such accompanying non-military planning.</p>

                            through Wednesday<note n="2" xml:id="d74fn2">July 21. </note> with the
                            White House press well enough, but I think the probability is that we
                            will have rising pressure in the coming days. For this reason, I myself
                            continue to think that the right time for your message—or a fireside
                            chat—or both at once, is Monday.<note n="3" xml:id="d74fn3">July
                                26.</note> We really cannot get an orderly and well-considered
                            decision made before that, but I doubt if we can hold the fort any
                            longer.</p>
                        <p>I myself feel very strongly that we should not dribble out bits and
                            pieces of this to the Press or to publishers before you make your final
                            decision and announcement. The Press people we need most on this
                            particular issue are the regular reporters, and the best thing we can do
                            for them is to be sure they get the news straight, and from you, and
                            on-the-record. If you didn't scare the meeting into silence today, I
                            will be greatly surprised, and I think it makes good sense for your
                            Government to deliberate for three days on an issue of this magnitude.
                            On this basis, it seems to me that on Friday, or Saturday morning, we
                            might announce that you are calling the Leadership to a meeting Sunday
                            afternoon or Monday morning, and expect to go to Congress Monday noon or
                            Monday evening.</p>
                        <p>I have an additional reason for proposing this schedule. Dean Rusk is
                            going to the Bohemian Grove to give a speech on Saturday, and he has
                            been hoping to take a day of rest in the bargain. He would like to leave
                            Friday morning and return Sunday afternoon. Yet he should clearly be
                            very much on hand when we meet the Leadership. The schedule I have
                            suggested meets both objectives.</p>
                        <p>I have discussed this matter only with Bob McNamara, and I find that he
                            concurs in this recommendation.</p>
                        <p>On a separate matter—Bob is carrying out your orders to plan this whole
                            job with only $300-$400 million in immediate new funds. But I think you
                            will want to know that he thinks our posture of candor and
                            responsibility would be better if we ask for $2 billion to take us
                            through <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0239"/>the end of the calendar
                            year, on the understanding that we will come back for more, if
                            necessary. Bob is afraid we simply cannot get away with the idea that a
                            call-up of the planned magnitude can be paid for by anything so small as
                            another few hundred million. <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Cy
                                Vance</persName> told me the other day that the overall cost is
                            likely to be on the order of $8 billion in the coming year and I can
                            understand Bob's worry that in the nature of things, these projected
                            costs will be sure to come out pretty quickly, especially if he looks as
                            if he was trying to pull a fast one.</p>
                        <p>I have not told Bob that I am reporting his worry to you; don't give me
                            away.</p>

                        <p>The following are some impressions—and personal reactions—to the Vietnam

                            which may be pertinent and useful:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Personal Impressions:</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>:</hi> Strikingly more
                            impressive, far more involved and committed than on any past occasion
                            where I have seen him close-up. His year of reflection seems to me to
                            have enhanced his vision—and value to you.</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic"> Rusk:</hi> Given only a degree or two more of warmth
                            and heat, he would be imposingly persuasive as a public leader. He is
                            too deferential, self-effacing. But his logic and impromptu articulation
                            is devastatingly effective and clear-cut. He assesses the stakes in
                            Vietnam more precisely and convincingly than anyone else I have
                            heard.</p>
                        <pb n="208" xml:id="pg_208" facs="0240"/>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>:</hi> A fortunate
                            choice for his present post. I do wish other Joint Chiefs could hear
                            more of these sessions.</p>
                        <p>As for the views of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, These are my reactions—and suggestions. Given his
                            point of view, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> is
                            impressively clear-headed and well-organized in his argument. He is
                            conscientious, not a critic. Obviously, his thinking is influenced by
                            two factors of a decade ago: (1) concern—held-over from the Stevenson
                            1952 campaign—for adverse U.S. reaction to efforts to keep any Asian war
                            limited, and (2) his other strong personal involvement, i.e., with the
                            French during their fiasco in Indo-China. Anyone emotionally involved in
                            those two experiences would be cautious, as <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> is cautious. Significantly, his argument is not the
                            argument of the academic intellectuals—it is much more sane and sound,
                            and merits respect as such.</p>
                        <p>Out of the discussions these thoughts occur:</p>
                        <p>1. Someone mentioned the Viet Cong are “creatures of habit.” So are we.
                            Your advisers have “the habit” of down-playing our role in Vietnam.
                            Hence, a tendency is present to insist that whatever is done is,
                            actually, only an extension of all we have been doing. This may be
                            self-deceptive.</p>
                        <p>2. What we are considering is not whether we continue a war—but whether
                            we start (or have started) a new war. The 1954-64 premises, principles
                            and pretexts no longer apply. This is no longer South Vietnam's war. We
                            are no longer advisers. The stakes are no longer South Vietnam's. The
                            war is ours. We are participants. The stakes are ours—and the
                            West's.</p>
                        <p>3. The two great needs are self-assessment—and clearer definition of
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">On Self-assessment:</hi> It seems dangerous to
                            insist, passively or vocally that the U.S. has not made mistaken
                            judgments since 1961. We must have done so. It would be constructive to
                            insist upon critical self-analysis to determine at least the pattern of
                            our errors.</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Objectives:</hi> Clearly, the acceptable objectives
                            in Vietnam—acceptable in proportion to U.S. sacrifice required—are
                            world-size, not country-size. It is hard to define an acceptable
                            objective in Vietnam: To seek one there leads inevitably to <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s conclusion and thesis. The
                            objectives—the acceptable objectives—must be in terms of Southeast Asia,
                            the Pacific or even the broad East-West relationship. Rusk sees it in
                            this dimension—and his logic prevails over <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s. We do need, I believe, to equate our purposes in
                            Southeast Asia with objectives broader and greater than the one country
                            itself. Only that will justify what lies ahead.</p>
                        <p>4. On troop support from other nations: We may be thinking too narrowly
                            on this. For many reasons, such support will not be forthcoming. One
                            reason is that our oldest ally already is more involved—relative to
                            strength—than we: i.e., Great Britain. If we can broaden the Nation's
                                <pb n="209" xml:id="pg_209" facs="0241"/>perspective and information
                            by defining regional rather than one-country objectives, it would be
                            helpful. Our efforts in Vietnam and Britain's efforts in Malaysia should
                            be packaged together for public consumption. The more relevant line of
                            action among allies would be to stop their trade with North Vietnam
                            rather than pester them for troops.</p>
                        <p>5. Clearly, the fixation about working with the Vietnam government is a
                            holdover from the ten-year effort to down-play our role there.
                            Basically, we are there not solely because of Vietnam's invitation, but
                            because of our obligations under <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. Our fidelity to a Treaty—not to a changeable
                            government—deserves more emphasis abroad and at home. It also offers a
                            predicate for the U.S. to run its own effort rather than stand by
                            seeking permission from a government-that-is-not-a-government.</p>
                        <p>6. Overall, your initiative in insisting that everyone “think” is very
                            satisfying, useful and stimulating. Defense, as well as State, should be
                            encouraged to re-examine its own premises and past performance—or so it
                            seems to me.</p>

                        <p>President: I asked <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to
                            invite you here to counsel with you on these problems and the ways to
                            meet them.</p>
                        <p>Hear from the Chiefs the alternatives open to you and then
                            recommendations on those alternatives from a military point.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Options open to us</p>
                        <p>1. Leave the country—with as little loss as possible—the “bugging out”
                            approach.</p>
                        <p>2. Maintain present force and lose slowly.</p>
                        <p>3. Add 100,000 men—recognizing that may not be enough—and adding more
                            next year.</p>
                        <p>Disadvantages of #3—risk of escalation, casualties will be high—may be a
                            long war without victory.</p>
                        <p>President: I would like you to start out by stating our present position
                            and where we can go.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MDADL1">McDonald</persName>: Sending Marines
                            has improved situation. I agree with <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> that we are committed to extent that we can't
                            move out. If we continue the way we are it will be a slow, sure victory
                            for the other side. By putting more men in it will turn the tide and let
                            us know what further we need to do. I wish we had done this long
                            before.</p>
                        <p>President: But you don't know if 100,000 will be enough. What makes you
                            conclude that if you don't know where we are going—and what will
                            happen—we shouldn't pause and find this out?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MDADL1">McDonald</persName>: Sooner or later we'll
                            force them to the conference table. We [<hi rend="italic">They</hi>?]
                            can't win an all out war.</p>
                        <p>President: If we put in 100,000 won't they put in an equal number?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MDADL1">McDonald</persName>: No. If we step up our
                            bombing—</p>
                        <p>President: Is this a chance we want to take?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MDADL1">McDonald</persName>: Yes, when I view the
                            alternatives. Get out now or pour in more men.</p>
                        <p>President: Is that all?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MDADL1">McDonald</persName>: I think our allies
                            will lose faith in us.</p>
                        <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0243"/>
                        <p>President: We have few allies really helping us.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MDADL1">McDonald</persName>: Thailand, for
                            example. If we walk out of Vietnam, the whole world will question our
                            word. We don't have much choice.</p>
                        <p>President: Paul, what is your view?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>: In that area not occupied
                            by US forces, it is worse, as I observed on my trip out there.</p>
                        <p>We have two alternatives—support <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> all
                            over this country—or fall out from secure position we do have. Make it
                            clear to populace that we are on their side. Gradually turn the tide of
                            losses by aiding <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> at certain
                            points.</p>
                        <p>If we just maintained what we have—more the Pres. problem than ours—to
                            acknowledge that we couldn't beat the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>,
                            the shape of the world will change.</p>
                        <p>President: What are our chances of success?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>: If we want to turn the
                            tide, by putting in more men, it would be about 60/40.</p>
                        <p>President: If we gave <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> all he asked for what are our chances? I
                            don't agree that <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> and China won't
                            come in.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>: Expand the area we could
                            maintain. In the Philippines and Greece it was shown that guerrillas
                            lost.</p>
                        <p>President: Would you send in more forces than <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> requests?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>: Yes. Depends on how
                            quickly they—</p>
                        <p>President: How many? 200 instead of 100?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>: Need another 100 in
                            January.</p>
                        <p>President: Can you do that?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: The current plan is to
                            introduce 100,000—with possibility of a second 100,000 by first of the
                            year.</p>
                        <p>President: What reaction is this going to produce?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: Since we are not
                            proposing an invasion of <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>, Soviets
                            will step up material and propaganda—same with <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss>s. Might have <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> introduce more regular troops.</p>
                        <p>President: Why wouldn't <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> pour in more
                            men? Also, call on volunteers from China and Russia.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: First, they may decide
                            they can't win by putting in forces they can't afford. At most would put
                            in two more divisions. Beyond that they strip their country and invite a
                            counter move on our part.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, on volunteers—the one thing all <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> fear is Chinese. For them to invite Chinese volunteers
                            is to invite China's taking over <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Weight of judgment is that <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> may
                            re-inforce their forces, they can't match us on a build-up.</p>
                        <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0244"/>
                        <p>From military view, we can handle, if we are determined to do so, China
                            and <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>President: Anticipate retaliation by Soviets in Berlin area?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: You may have some
                            flare-up but lines are so tightly drawn in Berlin that it raises risks
                            of escalation too quickly. Lemnitzer thinks no flare-up in Berlin. In
                            Korea, if Soviets undertook operations, it would be dangerous.</p>
                        <p>President: Admiral, would you summarize what you think we ought to
                            do?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MDADL1">McDonald</persName>: 1. Supply forces
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> has asked
                            for.</p>
                        <p>2. Prepare to furnish more (100,000) in 1966.</p>
                        <p>3. Commensurate building in air and naval forces, step up of air attacks
                            on <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. Bring in needed reserves and draft calls.</p>
                        <p>President: Any ideas on cost of what this would be?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Yes—$12
                            billion—1966.</p>
                        <p>President: Any idea what effect this will have on our economy?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: It would not require
                            wage and price controls in my judgment. Price index ought not go up more
                            than one point or two.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName>: If you put in these
                            requested forces and increase air and sea effort—we can at least turn
                            the tide where we are not losing anymore. We need to be sure we get the
                            best we can out of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>—need to bomb all
                            military targets available to us in <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>.
                            As to whether we can come to satisfactory solution with these forces, I
                            don't know. With these forces properly employed, and cutting off their
                            supplies, we can do better than we're doing.</p>
                        <p>President: Have results of bombing actions been as fruitful and
                            productive as we anticipated?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName>: No sir, they haven't
                            been. Productive in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, but not as
                            productive in <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> because we are not
                            striking the targets that hurt them.</p>
                        <p>President: Are you seriously concerned when we change targets we escalate
                            the war?</p>
                        <p>They might send more fighters down. Can't be certain if it will escalate
                            their efforts on the ground.</p>
                        <p>Would it hurt our chances at a conference if we started killing
                            civilians?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName>: We need to minimize
                            civilian killings.</p>
                        <p>President: Would you go beyond <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>'s recommendations?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName>: No sir.</p>
                        <p>President: How many planes lost?</p>
                        <pb n="213" xml:id="pg_213" facs="0245"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName>: 106 all types—small
                            percentage of total.</p>
                        <p>President: How many out there?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName>: 146 combat. We have
                            lost 54 combat.</p>
                        <p>President: How many Navy planes?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName>: In the 30's—about
                            125 combat.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZEM1">Zuckert</persName>: It's worth taking a
                            major step to avoid long run consequences of walking away from it.</p>
                        <p>President: Doesn't it really mean if we follow <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>'s requests we are in a
                            new war—this is going off the diving board.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: This is a major change
                            in US policy. We have relied on <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> to
                            carry the brunt. Now we would be responsible for satisfactory military
                            outcome.</p>
                        <p>President: Are we in agreement we would rather be out of there and make
                            our stand somewhere else?</p>
                        <p>Johnson: Least desirable alternative is getting out. Second least is
                            doing what we are doing. Best is to get in and get the job done.</p>
                        <p>President: But I don't know how we are going to get that job done. There
                            are millions of Chinese. I think they are going to put their stack in.
                            Is this the best place to do this? We don't have the allies we had in
                            Korea. Can we get our allies to cut off supplying the <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>?</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: No, we can't prevent
                            Japan, Britain, etc. to charter ships to Haifong.</p>
                        <p>President: Have we done anything to get them to stop?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: We haven't put the
                            pressure on them as we did in Cuba but even if we did, it wouldn't stop
                            the shipping.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Brown</persName>: It seems that all of our
                            alternatives are dark. I find myself in agreement with the others.</p>
                        <p>President: Is there anything to the argument this government is likely to
                            fail, and we will be asked to leave? If we try to match the enemy, we
                            will be bogged down in protracted war and have the government ask us to
                            leave.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Brown</persName>: Our lines of communication
                            are long.</p>
                        <p>President: How long?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Brown</persName>: 7000 miles from the West
                            Coast, but not too much greater than China's. Biggest weakness of
                            political base is lack of security they can offer their people.</p>
                        <p>President: Are we starting something that in 2-3 years we can't
                            finish?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Brown</persName>: It is costly to us to
                            strangle slowly, but chances of losing are less if we move in.</p>
                        <p>President: Suppose we told <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> of
                            requirements we need—he turns them down—and we have to get out and make

                            <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Brown</persName>: The Thais will go with the
                            winner.</p>
                        <p>President: If we didn't stop in Thailand where would we stop?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Laos, Cambodia,
                            Thailand, Burma, surely affect Malaysia. In 2-3 years Communist
                            domination would stop there, but ripple effect would be great—Japan,
                            India. We would have to give up some bases. Ayub would move closer to
                            China. Greece, Turkey would move to neutralist position. Communist
                            agitation would increase in Africa.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GGWMJ1">Greene</persName>: Situation is as tough
                            as when it started. But not as bad as it could be. Marines in 1st Corps
                            area is example of benefits.</p>
                        <p>Stakes:</p>
                        <p>1. National security stake. Matter of time before we go in some place
                            else.</p>
                        <p>2. Pledge we made.</p>
                        <p>3. Prestige before the rest of the world.</p>
                        <p>If you accept these stakes, there are two courses of action:</p>
                        <p>1. Get out</p>
                        <p>2. Stay in and win.</p>
                        <p>How to win:</p>
                        <p>1. South—</p>
                        <p>2. North</p>
                        <p>The enclave concept will work. Would like to introduce enough Marines to
                            do this. Two Marine divisions and one air wing. Extend.</p>
                        <p>28,000 there now—additional 72,000.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: <persName corresp="#p_GGWMJ1">Greene</persName> suggests these men over and
                            above the <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>
                            request.</p>
                        <p>President: Then you will need 80,000 more Marines to carry this out.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GGWMJ1">Greene</persName>: Yes. I am convinced we
                            are making progress with the <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>—in food
                            and construction. We are getting evidence of intelligence from <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>In the North—we haven't been hitting the right targets. We should hit
                                <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> storage—essential to their
                            transportation. Also airfields destroyed, <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>s and <gloss target="#t_IL281">IL28</gloss>'s. As soon
                            as <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> installations are operable.</p>
                        <p>President: What would they do?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GGWMJ1">Greene</persName>: Nothing. We can test it
                            by attacking <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> storage.</p>
                        <p>Then we should attack industrial complex in <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>. Also, they can be told by pamphlet drop why we are
                            doing this. Then we ought to blockade Cambodia—and stop supplies from
                            coming down.</p>
                        <p>How long will it take? 5 years—plus 500,000 troops. I think the US people
                            will back you.</p>
                        <p>President: How would you tell the American people what the stakes
                            are?</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_GGWMJ1">Greene</persName>: The place where they
                            will stick by you is the national security stake.</p>
                        <p>Johnson: We are in a face-down. The solution, unfortunately, is
                            long-term. Once the military solution is solved, the problem of
                            political solution will be more difficult.</p>
                        <p>President: If we come in with hundreds of thousands of men and billions
                            of dollars, won't this cause them to come in (China and Russia)?</p>
                        <p>Johnson: No. I don't think they will.</p>
                        <p>President: <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> didn't
                            think they would come in either.</p>
                        <p>Johnson: Yes, but this is not comparable to Korea. Same situation—China
                            bases and communications—</p>
                        <p>President: But China has plenty of divisions to move in, don't they?</p>
                        <p>Johnson: Yes, they do.</p>
                        <p>President: Then what would we do?</p>
                        <p>Johnson: (long silence) If so, we have another ball game.</p>
                        <p>President: But I have to take into account they will.</p>
                        <p>Johnson: I would increase the build-up near <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>—and increase action in Korea.</p>
                        <p>President: If they move in 31 divisions, what does it take on our
                            part?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Under favorable
                            conditions they could sustain 31 divisions and assuming Thais
                            contributed forces, it would take 300,000 plus what we need to combat

                        <p>President: But remember they're going to write stories about this like
                            they did the Bay of Pigs—and about my advisors. That's why I want you to
                            think very carefully about alternatives and plans.</p>
                        <p>Looking back on the Dominican Republic would you have done anything any

                        <p>Johnson: I would have cleaned out part of the city and gone in—and with

                        <p>President: Are you concerned about Chinese forces moving into <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>?</p>
                        <p>Johnson: There is no evidence of forces—only teams involved in logistics.

                        <p>President: I judge though that the big problem is one of national

                        <p>For 10 years every step we have taken has been based on a previous

                            which failed. As we get further into the bag, we get deeply bruised.
                            Also, we have made excessive claims we haven't been able to realize.</p>
                        <p>Also, after 20 years of warnings about war in Asia, we are now doing what

                        <p>We are about to fight a war we can't fight and win, as the country we are

                        <p>The failure on our own to fully realize what guerrilla war is like. We

                            compelled to up the reserves. Indications are that he will oppose
                            calling up the reserves.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: I think we can answer
                            most of the questions posed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>: If the military plan is
                            carried out, what is the ultimate result if it is successful?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: Political objective is
                            to maintain <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> as free and independent.
                            If we follow the course of action, we can carry out this objective.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: Probably after success,
                            we would withdraw most of our forces; [some?] international or
                            otherwise, would have to stay on.</p>
                        <p>If we can secure the military situation, it seems likely that we can get
                            some kind of stable government.</p>

                        <p>1. How big a change in policy is this and how do we explain it—in
                            political and military terms?</p>
                        <p>2. How do we inhibit Chinese and North Vietnamese response by both carrot
                            and stick?</p>
                        <p>3. How do we combine a peace offensive with stepped-up military
                            action?</p>

                        <p>4. Is this policy justified in terms of Vietnam, Asia or U.S. national
                            interests—or all three?</p>
                        <p>5. How do we get a political and social effort within Vietnam that is
                            equal in strength to the military effort?</p>
                        <p>6. What are our war aims? What is the answer to <persName corresp="#p_LWS1">Walter Lippmann</persName>'s question on this

                        <p>President: I don't think that calling up the reserves in itself is a
                            change of policy. There is a [<hi rend="italic">no</hi>?] question
                            though that we are going into a new kind of activity in <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>. Basic objective is to preserve the
                            independence and freedom of <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>. This is
                            not necessarily tied in with calling up reserves.</p>
                        <p>Rusk: The essence of policy is why we are there and what our war aims
                            are. Moving from 75,000 to 185,000 men is a change of policy. Much is to
                            be said for playing this low key.</p>
                        <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219" facs="0251"/>
                        <p>President: That one point needs to be stressed with Congressional
                            leadership—also to explain with candor what we are doing to the American
                            people. But when we do, we help the <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>
                            get their requests fulfilled by China and Russia.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: We can stay away from
                            “change of policy” but it is a change in risk and commitment. We need to
                            explain why it is in our interest to do it.</p>
                        <p>Services have submitted budget request by [<hi rend="italic">of</hi>?]
                            $12 billion. We can cut this down by half or more.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Moyers</persName>: I don't think the press
                            thinks we are going to change basic policy, but the requirements to meet
                            that policy.</p>
                        <p>President: That's right and we ought to say it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: I hope we can avoid a
                            debate on whether it is a change. We always lose on this. We are
                            becoming co-defendants with <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>McCloy: The country is looking to getting on with the war.</p>
                        <p>President: There are three alternatives:</p>
                        <p>1. Sit and lose slowly</p>
                        <p>2. Get out</p>
                        <p>3. Put in what needs to go in.</p>
                        <p>Rusk: If we bring out our message of decision while the Bucharest
                                meeting<note n="2" xml:id="d78fn2">The ninth congress of the
                                Romanian Communist Party, held in Bucharest July 19-24, was also
                                attended by delegations of over 50 other Communist Parties,
                                including a Chinese delegation and a Soviet delegation led by
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>.</note> is going
                            on—it might bring them closer together. What we do in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> is not of great concern to China. But a
                            progressive step-up in bombing increases risk of China intrusion.</p>
                        <p>President: But the Chiefs say what we are doing in the North is not
                            enough, only pin pricking them, just goosing them.</p>
                        <p>Rusk: But it is contradictory to do this when we can't find anybody in
                            the South.</p>
                        <p>Both China and the Soviets have pressure on them. A commitment in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> is one thing, but a commitment to
                            preserve another socialist state is quite another. This is a distinction
                            we must bear in mind.</p>
                        <p>We have a 1 in 5 chance of Russia's staying out if we make our commitment
                            and if we bomb Hanoi. A commitment of large forces by us will lead to
                            pressures on us to destroy Hanoi. This is the key point.</p>
                        <p>McCloy: Do you think they will let go if they still have sanctuary?</p>
                        <p>Rusk: Their only sanctuary is 1/5 of the country.</p>
                        <p>A. Dean: What do you do if the war drags on—with mounting
                            casualties—where do we go? The people say if we are not doing what is
                            necessary to end it, why don't we do what is necessary?</p>
                        <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0252"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: We are begging the
                            questions. If we bomb Haifong, would this end the war? and the answer is
                            “No.” We have only destroyed so far about 20% of the ammunitions
                            capacity and a lesser percentage of barracks capacity.</p>
                        <p>Dean: If this carries on for some years, we'll get in the same fix we
                            were in Korea and the Yalu.</p>
                        <p>Rusk: We were under no pressures to make it a larger war until the war
                            was practically over.</p>
                        <p>McCloy: If we could define our objectives specifically, what are our
                            objectives in a discussion? What do we have to negotiate?</p>
                        <p>Rusk: 1. Infiltration from the North must stop.</p>
                        <p>2. We have no interests in a permanent military base there.</p>
                        <p>3. 1954-1962 agreements ought to be solved by peaceful means and not
                            …</p>
                        <p>McCloy: When do the troops get withdrawn?</p>
                        <p>Rusk: When proof of infiltration—stopping.</p>
                        <p>Bundy: If we really were the ones for free elections, it would be good.
                            It is difficult for Saigon to sign on.</p>
                        <p>McCloy: Would we be willing to take a Tito government or a <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> victory?</p>
                        <p>Bundy: That's where our plan begins to unravel.</p>
                        <p>Now—how to keep a reasonable peace offensive going—</p>
                        <p>President: We have got to keep peace proposals going. It's like a
                            prizefight. Our right is our military power, but our left must be our
                            peace proposals. Every time you move troops forward, you move diplomats
                            forward. I want this done. The generals want more and more—and go
                            farther and farther. But State has to supply me with some, too.</p>
                        <p>We need Ernie Pyle out there interviewing soldiers who can tell how proud
                            they are to do their duty.</p>
                        <p>Rusk: Thinking of Bucharest meeting, I suggest you meet with the
                            leadership on Tuesday<note n="3" xml:id="d78fn3">July 27. </note> and
                            make a statement on Wednesday.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: We have big problem of

                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: We can't delay this
                            from the public.</p>
                        <p>President: Congress ought to be briefed on Saturday or Sunday and go up

                            out of Vietnam</p>
                        <p>I assume the following to be true, much official crap to the
                            contrary.</p>
                        <p>(1) Vietnam is of no great intrinsic importance. Had it gone Communist
                            after World War II we would be just as strong as now and we would never
                            waste a thought on it.</p>
                        <p>(2) No question of high principle is involved. It is their rascals or
                            ours. Both sides would lose in free elections!</p>
                        <p>(3) The basic issue is that we must show that we can't be thrown out—that
                            we don't give up under fire. This would also be bad here at home.</p>
                        <p>(4) It is right to consider the politics of the problem. A great many
                            people who make policy do not have to take the political heat. Rusk ran
                            the Korean War and his career was made by it. <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> ran for office during the war
                            and was destroyed. The same would have happened to Harry Truman had he
                            been up.</p>
                        <p>(5) Political questions are partly what we make them. Despite all of
                            their efforts the Republicans could not make mileage last autumn out of
                            Cuba. That was because nothing was happening there; it wasn't in the
                            news and people couldn't be aroused.</p>
                        <p>I urge we:</p>
                        <p>(1) Instruct officials and spokesmen to stop saying the future of
                            mankind, the United States and human liberty is being decided in
                            Vietnam. It isn't; this merely builds up a difficult problem out of all
                            proportion. It is also terrible politics. It directs maximum attention
                            to where difficulties are bound to be greatest.</p>
                        <p>(2) Stop saying that we are going to reconquer the whole country. We are
                            not going to pacify Chicago or Harlem. The easiest way to have a failure
                            is to set one up for ourselves by promising to do what can't be
                            done.</p>
                        <p>(3) Let us apply a policy of political patience in the area. That is a
                            technique you understand. It means quietly marking out areas (including
                            of course Saigon) which we can hold, protect and feed if necessary for
                                <pb n="222" xml:id="pg_222" facs="0254"/>years. Then we hold these
                            and worry very little about the rest. This proves our main point which
                            is that we can't be thrown out. There is a safe haven for Catholics and
                            anti-communists.</p>
                        <p>(4) The Viet Cong will not attack these areas frontally. Casualties will
                            be low. High level trips and other contrived publicity should be kept to
                            the minimum.</p>
                        <p>(5) Stop or gradually suspend the bombing north and south. This has
                            slight military value, alarms our people and other countries and, above
                            all, keeps the place at the top of the news with maximum attention there
                            and minimum attention where it belongs. (I think it may harden
                            resistance to negotiation also—but on this no one can be sure and I am
                            confining myself here to facts.)</p>
                        <p>(6) Keep open the offer of negotiations. But we should not count on this
                            policy forcing them to the table anytime soon. But someday they will
                            come.</p>
                        <p>Results:</p>
                        <p>(1) Unless they attack head on, which we can rule out, we will prove our
                            staying power. We won't be playing their game by sending our forces out
                            into the jungle where ambush works.</p>
                        <p>(2) The whole place will go on the back burner. Public attention will
                            come back to areas of sound achievement of the Administration where it
                            belongs.</p>
                        <p>(3) The Republicans will bleat as Keating did about Cuba. That will hurt
                            them more than us.</p>
                        <p>(4) It will take the Russians off the hook and enable us to make progress
                            there.</p>
                        <p>Final Observations:</p>
                        <p>I would think it worth running some risk of criticism to avoid calling up
                            reserves. This will add to the publicity and wrong emphasis on Vietnam.
                            I hope searching questions are asked on the need for these men. (Why not
                            some from the divisions in Korea?) But after the initial flurry of
                            publicity, this is still the right policy after a call-up.</p>
                        <p>In the past there were two difficulties with this program. It would have
                            undermined the South Vietnamese government and required the commitment
                            of our troops. Now there isn't any Vietnamese government worth worrying
                            about and our forces are committed.</p>

                        <p>The great problem is our own eager beavers who do not consider the mood
                            of our own people come the next election, and whose political teat is
                            not in the wringer.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Legally the Reserves may be called up either by Executive Order or
                            through legislative action. Regarding Executive Order action, 10 U.S.C.
                            673 authorizes the calling up of up to one million Reserves. However,
                            the President must first declare a new national emergency. 10 U.S.C. 673
                            does not permit the extension of enlistments except for the Navy and
                            Marine Corps.</p>
                        <p>The Reserves may also be called up by the Service Secretaries “in time of
                            war or of national emergency declared by Congress, or when otherwise
                            authorized by law …” (10 U.S.C. 672). This was the route used in 1961
                            during the Berlin crisis when Congress passed a Joint Resolution
                            authorizing the President to “order any unit, and any member not
                            assigned to a unit organized to serve as a unit, in the Ready Reserve of
                            an Armed Force to active duty for not more than twelve consecutive
                            months.” This law also limited the number of Ready Reservists on active
                            duty (other than for training) without their consent under this section
                            at any one time. The law also authorized the involuntary extension of
                            enlistments or other obligated service for not more than twelve months.
                                <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0256"/>The Resolution was followed
                            by an Executive Order<note n="2" xml:id="d80fn2">Executive Order 10957,
                                August 10, 1961.</note> delegating to the Secretary of Defense and
                            the Secretaries of the military departments the authority conferred by
                            the Joint Resolution.</p>
                        <p>This method of calling up Reserves seems far and away the best. It
                            assures Congressional participation and support and avoids the problems
                            involved in declaring a new national emergency.</p>
                        <p>Finally, in light of experience we should think about including
                            limitations on the maximum number of Reservists to be called up and the
                            duration of active service under a Congressional Joint Resolution.</p>

                        <p>We further assume (a) that the increase in forces would be accompanied by

                            no major grouping threatened or appeared to threaten the 17th Parallel,
                            and (c) that we might either continue present policy with regard to air
                            strikes or extend these strikes in North Vietnam to include attacks on

                        <p rend="center">The Estimate</p>
                        <p>1. Communists and non-Communists alike would see in the increased US
                            military involvement in Vietnam a strong indication that the US saw
                            little hope of early negotiations. This would be particularly true if,
                            at the same time, the US extended its air operations in North
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Viet Cong and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> Reactions</p>
                        <p>2. At present the Viet Cong (<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>) and North
                            Vietnamese (<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>) leaders appear
                            confident that their course in South Vietnam promises ultimate and
                            possibly early success without important concessions on their part. They
                            seem to believe that they can achieve a series of local military
                            successes which, sooner or later, will bring victory through a
                            combination of a deteriorating South Vietnamese army (<gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>) morale and effectiveness, a collapse
                            of anti-Communist government in Saigon, and an exhaustion of the US will

                        <p>3. We do not believe that inauguration of the US actions here assumed
                            would basically alter these expectations. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> probably
                            have come to expect increased US commitments, and they probably believe
                            that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, with increased North
                            Vietnamese assistance, can find ways to offset the effect of larger US
                            forces. Nor do we think that the extension of air attacks to military
                            targets in the Hanoi and Haiphong area would significantly injure the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> ability to persevere in the South
                            or persuade the Hanoi Government that the price of persisting was
                            unacceptably high.<note n="3" xml:id="d81fn3">The Assistant Chief of

                                substitute the following: “3. We believe that inauguration of the US
                                actions here assumed, which emphasize US willingness and
                                determination to become more deeply involved in combat operations in
                                the South and eliminate the concept of an area ‘sanctuary’ in North
                                Vietnam, has a reasonable chance of basically altering the
                                Communists' short-term expectations. While the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> probably have come to expect some additional US
                                commitments, and they probably believe that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, with increased North Vietnamese
                                assistance, can find ways to offset the effect of larger US forces,
                                such confidence could be quite quickly undermined by effectively
                                expanded US combat operations. Extension of air attacks to military
                                targets in the Hanoi and Haiphong area would pose the added threat
                                that urban/industrial targets might be next. The selective and
                                limited nature of US bombing target selections to date may have led
                                Hanoi seriously to underestimate the extent of US determination to
                                exert the power necessary to force discontinuance of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> support for the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. US military actions resulting from
                                the assumed program could well persuade the Hanoi Government that
                                the price of persisting was becoming unacceptably high.” [Footnote

                        <p>4. If the extension of air attacks were to include sustained interdiction
                            of land lines of communication leading from South China, these actions
                            would obviously make the delivery of Soviet and Chinese aid more
                            difficult and costly, and would have a serious impact on the limited
                            industrial sector of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> general
                            economy. It would still not have a critical impact on the Communist
                            determination to persevere and would not, at least for the short term,
                            seriously impair VC capabilities in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>5. If, in addition, POL targets in the Hanoi-Haiphong area were destroyed
                            by air attacks, the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>'s ability to
                            provide transportation for the general economy would be severely
                            reduced. It would also complicate their military logistics. If
                            additional <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> forces were employed in
                            South Vietnam on a scale sufficient to counter increased US troop
                            strength, this would substantially increase the amount of supplies
                            needed in the South. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> also depend
                            on supplies from the North to maintain their present level of
                            large-scale operations. The accumulated strains of a prolonged
                            curtailment of supplies received from North Vietnam would obviously have
                            an impact on the Communist effort in the South. They would certainly
                            inhibit and might even prevent an increase in large-scale <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> military activity, though they would
                            probably not force any significant reduction in <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> terrorist tactics of harassment and sabotage. These
                            strains, particularly if they produced a serious check in the
                            development of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> capabilities for
                            large-scale (multi-battalion) operations might lead the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to consider negotiations.<note n="4" xml:id="d81fn4">The Director of Intelligence and Research, for the

                                greater damage and harassment caused by sustained air attack on
                                lines of communication (<gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>) and
                                other targets, the capacities of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                                and Laos <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> are sufficient to
                                permit support of the war in South Vietnam at the scale envisaged in
                                this estimate. Other significant factors supporting this position
                                are the impossibility of doing irreparable damage to <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> capacity; demonstrated Communist
                                logistic resourcefulness and ability to move large amounts of war
                                material long distances over difficult terrain by primitive means;
                                and the difficulty of detecting, let alone stopping, sea
                                infiltration. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> But the final
                            decision on whether to seek negotiations would depend to a great extent
                            on political <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0259"/>developments in
                            the Indochina area and elsewhere, and on the actual course of combat in
                            South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>6. In response to the US program, the Communists would almost certainly
                            undertake measures to increase their own strength in South Vietnam for a
                            higher level of struggle. They are already augmenting <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> units and dispatching additional <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> forces to South Vietnam; the assumed
                            US actions would probably result in a speeding up of this process. By
                            the end of 1965, the total of <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss>
                            regulars in organized units in South Vietnam could reach 20,000 to
                            30,000 men. Although the Communists are aware of the dangers of
                            concentrating their troops in large numbers, they might, during the next
                            few months, attempt major assaults against <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces and positions, seeking to shatter <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> before the increased weight of US
                            strength could be brought to bear.</p>
                        <p>7. In coping with larger US forces employed in a more aggressive fashion,
                            we believe that the Viet Cong would seek to avoid the kind of
                            engagements which risked a serious Communist defect. Instead, they would
                            probably concentrate on harassments intended to bleed and humiliate US
                            forces, trapping and destroying isolated units where possible. At a
                            minimum, the Communists would almost certainly continue present efforts
                            to cut land communication lines and would step up the dispatch of small,
                            expendable teams on sabotage and assassination missions designed to make
                            the US look impotent or foolish. The Communists might also seek to
                            increase their activities in Laos.</p>
                        <p>8. Over the longer run, the Communists' strategy will depend upon the
                            actual course of combat and their estimates of South Vietnamese
                            stability and US will to persist. They are predisposed to attach great
                            weight to signs of disintegration in Saigon and to manifestations of
                            domestic US opposition to Administration policies. These boost popular
                            morale on the Communist side and reinforce the leadership's conviction
                            that Communist staying power is inherently superior.</p>
                        <p>9. Should future military and political developments bring this
                            conviction into serious doubt, the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            might express increased interest in negotiations. However, they would
                            endeavor to preserve their own freedom of action while laying
                            inhibitions on US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military
                            operations, hoping to promote disarray in Saigon and encourage US
                            opinion in favor of withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>10. Faced with the buildup outlined in our assumptions, the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would probably request more air defense
                            equipment from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, including
                                <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s, fighters, technicians, and
                            perhaps pilots, particularly if US air attacks were expanded. From the
                            Chinese, Hanoi would probably request more radar equipment,
                            anti-aircraft artillery, and technicians in addition to a further
                            increase in shipments of infantry arms and ammunition. Hanoi might also
                            request China (and, perhaps, North Korea) to furnish aircraft and
                            pilots. In general, however, we believe that <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0260"/>Hanoi would wish to maintain some limits on, and a
                            rough balance between, Soviet and Chinese personnel.</p>
                        <p>11. Deployments on the scale here assumed would cause the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> some concern about US invasion. This
                            would be true even if US forces took up positions which were not
                            suggestive of an invasion. We believe, however, that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would not react to this concern by
                            requesting the introduction of Chinese combat forces. It probably would
                            make such a request only if actual invasion seemed clearly imminent.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Chinese Communist Reactions</p>
                        <p>12. The Chinese are probably even more convinced than the Vietnamese
                            Communists that if the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> remain firm, in the end the US will be
                            wholly defeated in Vietnam. Renewed US determination, evidenced by the
                            buildup assumed in this estimate, would give the Chinese some pause but,
                            in our view, not much. They would believe that the US measures were
                            sufficient only to postpone defeat while magnifying its eventual
                            effect.</p>
                        <p>13. We do not believe that the Chinese would react to the assumed US
                            moves including the present level of air attacks, by overtly intervening
                            in the military struggle with combat forces. They are already stepping
                            up their military assistance, including the introduction of some rear
                            service elements into North Vietnam, and would give more aid if
                            requested by the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. Moreover, they
                            would try to increase alarm among non-Communists, especially the US
                            public, by intensifying their propaganda and reiterating their
                            willingness to accept hostilities if attacked by the US. They would
                            probably continue to strengthen their forces in South China and might
                            take some further overt steps toward mobilization.</p>
                        <p>14. If air strikes were extended to the Hanoi-Haiphong area and
                            particularly to lines of communication from South China, the chances of
                            Chinese Communist air intervention from Chinese bases would increase.
                            This would particularly be true if the air strikes were effective in
                            cutting the main roads and rail lines over which the principal supplies
                            are moving. While we believe the Chinese would be reluctant to engage
                            the US in an air war or to risk US retaliation against Chinese military
                            installations, we consider the chances are about even that Chinese
                            aircraft would deliberately engage the US over North Vietnam from bases
                            within China. We do not believe, however, that this would lead to
                            greatly increased Chinese Communist participation in the conflict. In
                            any case, if large numbers of US aircraft were operating close to the
                            frontiers of China the likelihood of hostile encounters would be
                                high.<note n="5" xml:id="d81fn5">The Director, Defense Intelligence

                                and the Director of NSA, do not agree with the judgment expressed in
                                this paragraph. They believe that it should read as follows: “If air
                                strikes were extended to the Hanoi-Haiphong area and particularly to
                                lines of communication from South China, the chances of Chinese
                                Communist air intervention from Chinese bases would increase.
                                Nevertheless, we believe the Chinese would be reluctant to engage
                                the US in an air war or to risk US retaliation against Chinese
                                military installations. We therefore consider it unlikely that
                                Chinese aircraft would deliberately engage the US over North Vietnam
                                from bases within China.”</note>

                        <p>The Director of Intelligence and Research, Department of State, believes
                            that the chances are better than even that Chinese aircraft would
                            deliberately engage the US under these circumstances. Even if air
                            engagements were accidental they would have extremely dangerous
                            repercussions and if they were deliberate they could not fail to lead to
                            a wider war. [Footnote in the source text.]</p>

                        <p>15. If, in the circumstances described in paragraph 9, the Viet Cong and
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> at some point wished to move
                            toward negotiations, an important divergence might open up between Hanoi
                            and Peiping. The Chinese are themselves not suffering direct military
                            damage and they fear that negotiations would give the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> a chance to increase its role in
                            Vietnam. Thus they would exert strong pressures to dissuade the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> from entering into negotiations.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Soviet Reactions</p>
                        <p>16. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> hopes for an eventual
                            Communist victory in South Vietnam, but it is more conscious than
                            Peiping and Hanoi of the larger military risks. Moreover, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> wants to maintain or improve its
                            influence over the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and in the world
                            Communist movement generally; it does not wish the kind of Communist
                            victory which would magnify the prestige and power of China. Unlike
                            Peiping and Hanoi, Moscow is concerned with minimizing damage to
                            East-West relations. In this situation, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> prefers a course of negotiations, but it cannot afford
                            to appear laggard in supporting the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>,
                            and it is deepening its commitment to Hanoi's cause.</p>
                        <p>17. In the circumstances outlined in our assumptions, we believe that the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would see no alternative to
                            continued support of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and further
                            expansion of its military aid. It would thus be likely to grant a <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> request for additional air defense
                            equipment and personnel. It would probably feel compelled to comply
                            promptly with <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> requests to replace
                            air defense equipment destroyed by US attacks in the Hanoi area. The
                            Soviet aid program might be hampered by Chinese restrictions on transit
                            rights.</p>
                        <p>18. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would probably indicate
                            that, if the US remains unyielding in Vietnam, it faces trouble
                            elsewhere in the world, as, for example, in Berlin. We do not think,
                            however, that Moscow would confront us with a major challenge. Nor do we
                            believe that the Soviets would wish to foreclose the possibility of
                            negotiations at some future stage; <pb n="230" xml:id="pg_230" facs="0262"/>indeed, they would probably work to keep this
                            possibility alive on both sides.</p>
                        <p>19. We believe that the US decisions considered here would produce
                            important reactions in general Soviet policy. Moscow would almost
                            certainly harden its general stance toward the US. For example, although
                            the Soviets have agreed to renewed disarmament talks, partly in order to
                            check the deterioration in East-West relations, the assumed US course in
                            Vietnam would probably lead them to devote the talks entirely to attacks
                            on the US or even to break them off.</p>
                        <p>20. The assumed moves would carry total US military manpower above the
                            2.8-2.9 million total which we estimate for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>; they would also imply a reversal of the downward
                            trend in US military spending which <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> cited in justifying the 1965 reduction in the
                            overt Soviet military budget. We believe that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s declared policy of restraining or
                            even reducing military expenditures has been under attack by military
                            spokesmen in recent months and is the subject of debate within the
                            collective leadership. It is likely that the US moves, plus the
                            worsening of general Soviet-US relations, would strengthen the position
                            of those arguing for additional military appropriations. In those
                            circumstances, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> probably would
                            respond with an overt increase in its own military spending.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. Non-Communist Reactions</p>
                        <p>21. Most non-Communist nations have already realized that the US, already
                            heavily engaged in South Vietnam, is likely to increase its commitment
                            if necessary. The measures here considered would nevertheless cause
                            rising alarm because, in combination with Communist statements in
                            response, they would revive and fortify fears of increased cold-war
                            tensions and even of a much larger war. This might make some governments
                            more reluctant to give public support to US policy, particularly
                            governments in political difficulty, e.g., the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Canada, and Norway. Significant extension of bombing in
                            North Vietnam would increase apprehension in these countries. Over the
                            longer run, however, the more important reactions will depend on the
                            subsequent course of the conflict.</p>
                        <p>22. In non-Communist Asia, Japan offers the most serious problem. We
                            believe the Sato government would maintain its policy of supporting US
                            policy in spite of howls from the press and opposition forces. Sato's
                            position would be made much more difficult, however, if Okinawa or
                            especially Japan were to become a greatly expanded conduit for support
                            of US forces in Vietnam, or if it appeared that China was about to
                            become involved in the fighting. India would deplore increased bombing
                            of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> but would otherwise continue
                            its position of public questioning and private acquiescence in US
                            actions in South Vietnam. Pakistan, hoping to continue to receive
                            American aid while remaining on good terms <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0263"/>with China, would reaffirm its neutrality and its
                            noninvolvement in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">V. Reactions to the Mode of Announcement</p>
                        <p>23. If the announcements were made in piecemeal fashion and with no more
                            high level emphasis than necessary, the development of a crisis
                            atmosphere might be mitigated. It is also possible that private
                            assurances to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> that the US
                            increase in overall military strength was directed solely toward the
                            situation in Vietnam, and not meant to improve the US position vis-a-vis
                            the Soviets, might soften the tone of the Soviet response. This
                            avoidance of strident recriminations might in turn decrease somewhat the
                            negative reaction of non-Communist countries. We believe, however, that
                            the reactions of the Communist powers, particularly in the military
                            field, would not be basically changed by the method of announcement. We
                            also believe that there would still be increased apprehension among
                            non-Communist countries.</p>

                        <p>In my view, we should take the Viet Nam issue to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council concurrently with the

                        <p>I would recommend that we should propose and seek support for a simple

                        <p>The virtue of this is that it would emphasize that the President is

                        <p>The judgment of Harlan Cleveland has been that we have the votes to pass
                            the suggested resolution. This would have to be verified by
                            consultations in New York to confirm the accuracy of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Cleveland</persName>'s conclusion in light of
                            present and proposed developments.</p>
                        <p>The arguments pro and con undoubtedly have already been adequately
                            presented to you by Secretary Rusk. I have four pro arguments to
                            add:</p>
                        <p>1. In my experience, I have never found that renewed expressions of the
                            desire to seek a peaceful settlement through unconditional discussions
                            undermine the firm position of the proponent not to settle by force
                            rather than agreement. On the other hand, such expressions reinforce the
                            support of the rank and file and even critical leaders for a firm
                            policy. This was proved by your Baltimore proposal.<note n="2" xml:id="d82fn2">Reference is to the President's speech at Johns

                        <p>2. Placing the matter before the Security Council may afford the Soviet
                            Union an opportunity to blow off steam rather than to respond more
                            drastically.</p>
                        <p>3. It is at least likely as a result of the developments next week that
                            we will be in the dock of the Security Council on this subject as a
                            defendant. There are obvious advantages in being the plaintiff rather
                            than in a defensive role.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>I enclose two memoranda. One is from <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Joe
                                Sisco</persName>,<note n="2" xml:id="d83fn2">Not attached and not
                                found. </note> and the other is a paper on the history of troop
                            recommendations which you instructed me to prepare in our meeting
                            yesterday.</p>
                        <p>I also had a talk with <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>, and
                            my own belief is that with further effort we can find a way, showing our
                            readiness to go to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> without
                            exposing ourselves to much danger in the Security Council. We did it
                            successfully at the time of the Gulf of Tonkin, and I think we can do it
                            again. I believe that the public advantage of showing readiness to speak
                            our peace [piece] in the Security Council outweighs the disadvantage of
                            the Soviet response, and I also think that with appropriate pressures,
                            we can keep at least 8 members of the Security Council on our side in
                            keeping the focus sharply on the need for discussions. The members of
                            the Security Council, for your information, are:</p>
                        <p>US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, France, Nationalist China, and the
                            Soviet Union—Permanent Members</p>
                        <p>The Netherlands, Uruguay, Bolivia, Jordan, Ivory Coast, and
                            Malaysia—Temporary Members</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> himself says we can get the
                            US, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, the ChiNats, the Dutch, and
                            the two Latin Americans. I believe that strong diplomacy would give us
                            Jordan, the Ivory Coast, and Malaysia as well—all three of them owe us a
                            lot in different ways.</p>

                        <p>This story relates almost entirely to 1965. When you became President, US
                            forces in Vietnam totaled 16,000. On 31 December 1964, they totaled
                            23,000. Today they are between 75 and 80,000, and you are considering
                            increases of another 100,000 between now and November.</p>
                        <p>In December and January, our attention did not focus upon increased
                            ground forces. We were trying to get the Huong Government to pull up its
                            socks, and we were preparing to authorize air strikes at the right
                            moment. We had no recommendations from the military for major ground
                            force deployments.</p>
                        <p>At the end of January, after Bob and I discussed with you our growing
                            doubts, you sent me to Vietnam. During that trip, the attack on Pleiku
                            occurred and in February, you put into effect the program of limited air
                            strikes against North Vietnam,<note n="5" xml:id="d83fn5">See <ref target="frus1964-68v02#d131">

                            is in this connection that the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended, and
                            you approved, the deployment of Marines to Danang. Two battalion landing
                            teams were approved for such deployment on February 25.<note n="6" xml:id="d83fn6">See ibid., <ref target="frus1964-68v02#d170">Document

                        </p>
                        <p>The bombing did not reverse the situation and we did not expect it would.
                            In the first week of March, you sent General <persName corresp="#p_JGH1">Harold Johnson</persName> to Vietnam. He returned with three basic
                            recommendations:<note n="7" xml:id="d83fn7">See ibid., <ref target="frus1964-68v02#d179">Documents 179</ref> and <ref target="frus1964-68v02#d197">197</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>First, a 21-Point program of small actions which was promptly
                            approved;</p>
                        <p>Second, a deployment of a tailored division force either to the highlands
                            or to certain bases; and</p>
                        <p>Third, a four division ground force to contain infiltration by land.</p>
                        <p>The last two recommendations were tentative in form and were not pressed
                            to a decision. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>,
                            in an important dispatch on March 16 (Saigon 3003) weighed the pros and
                            cons of a single US division and recommended that judgment be
                            reserved.<note n="8" xml:id="d83fn8">Ibid., <ref target="frus1964-68v02#d204">Document 204</ref>. Telegram 3003 was received on March
                                17.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>At the end of March, General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> visited Washington and there was discussion of a
                            possible three-division force, as suggested by the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff, but <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> himself was
                            skeptical and reported a similar skepticism in Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>.<note n="9" xml:id="d83fn9">See

                            Secretaries of State and Defense recommended that the decision be
                            deferred and that instead we should approve deployment of two additional
                            Marine battalions and an 18-20,000 man increase in other US support
                            forces. This recommendation was accepted in the first days of
                            April.<note n="10" xml:id="d83fn10">See ibid., <ref target="frus1964-68v02#d230">Documents 230</ref> and <ref target="frus1964-68v02#d242">242</ref>.</note>

                        <p>The study of ground-force deployment continued in April, and on Tuesday,
                            April 20, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SAUSG1">Sharp</persName>,

                            point there were 2,000 Koreans and 33,000 US troops in the country, and
                            an additional 18,000 were already approved. After the Honolulu
                            discussions, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            recommended additional deployments leading to a total strength of
                            82,000—including 13 combat battalions. Part of this recommendation was
                            given formal approval on April 21;<note n="12" xml:id="d83fn12">See
                                ibid., <ref target="frus1964-68v02#d266">Documents 266</ref>, <ref target="frus1964-68v02#d269">269</ref>, and <ref target="frus1964-68v02#d271">271</ref>.</note> and other
                            parts on May 15. This set of recommendations was the most important
                            between January and the present, and I attach <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s memorandum of April
                            21.<note n="13" xml:id="d83fn13">Ibid., <ref target="frus1964-68v02#d265">Document

                        </p>
                        <p>Early in May, you requested $700 million for Vietnam,<note n="14" xml:id="d83fn14">See ibid., <ref target="frus1964-68v02#d283">Document
                                283</ref>.</note> and our defense of this request and related
                            statements made it clear that additional forces were being sent. On June
                            16, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> gave a full public
                            exposition, announcing the planned deployment of 15 battalions, with a
                            total military strength of 70-75,000.<note n="15" xml:id="d83fn15">A

                        </p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, on June 11, after discussions with <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>, the Joint Chiefs recommended additional
                            deployments to a total of 116,000.<note n="16" xml:id="d83fn16">See vol.
                                II, <ref target="frus1964-68v02#d346">Document 346</ref>.</note> The most
                            important element in this recommendation was the air-mobile division. On
                            June 19 you gave approval to the necessary preparatory steps for these
                            deployments, without deciding on the deployment itself.</p>
                        <p>On July 2, the Joint Chiefs produced a further recommendation for a total
                            troop strength of 179,000, again in coordination with <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>. Before approving this
                            recommendation, you sent <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to Vietnam.<note n="17" xml:id="d83fn17">See
                                    <ref target="#d49">Document 49</ref>.</note> With marginal
                            modifications, it is this recommendation which is now before you for
                            decision.</p>
                        <p>The essence of this history, I think, is that initially we all had grave
                            objections to major US ground force deployments. Even those in favor
                            (like my brother <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName>), wanted to
                            try other things first, and none of us was prepared to urge on <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> things he was not urging
                            on us.</p>
                        <p>Then when we got major bases of our own, largely for air action, we moved
                            quite promptly to protect them. These deployments did not give us bad
                            reactions, and it became easier for <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> to propose, and for us to accept,
                            additional deployments. Thus, between the end of March and the beginning
                            of July—a period of only three months—we <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0268"/>moved from recommended force levels of 33,000 to
                            recommended force levels of 180,000. We also moved from the mission of
                            base security to the mission of active combat in whatever way seems wise
                            to General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I have found this review instructive. It suggests to me that <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s Plan 3 is better than his
                            other two plans. I think we should now approve the recommended
                            deployments through November. I think that at the same time we should

                                accompaniment was a clear understanding with the South Vietnamese
                                Government that it would take every possible step to put the country
                                on a war footing. (Ibid.)</note> In approaching the matter of

                            effort, we would divide the matter into two parts; those commitments
                            which we might seek privately and those which we might get <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to state publicly or allow us to use
                            publicly in U.S.</p>
                        <p>In private, there would be some advantage in informing the senior <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials that prior to undertaking to
                            provide additional military aid we would like to verify following
                            understandings:</p>
                        <p>A. Our joint war aims are expressed in general terms in the four points
                            announced by FM Do on June 22.<note n="3" xml:id="d84fn3">Not found.
                            </note> We will work together privately in refining and amplifying these
                            general terms, meanwhile will avoid giving any public impression of
                            divergence of views.</p>
                        <pb n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0269"/>
                        <p>B. We will continue as agreed previously to keep each other informed of
                            policy decisions of mutual interest in advance of public
                            information.</p>
                        <p>C. We will cooperate together to control inflation and to end the
                            currency black market. In this regard we agree that there will be no
                            increase in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> budget or wage increases
                            without prior consultation.</p>
                        <p>D. We will always exchange views frankly on the subject of incompetent
                            U.S. or <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials who are not
                            performing adequately and will undertake to replace those who are found
                            to be unsatisfactory to the joint effort.</p>
                        <p>E. U.S. military forces will be employed as determined by General
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> who will be
                            guided by the White House statement of June 9 (Depcirtel 2470, June
                                9).<note n="4" xml:id="d84fn4">The statement is printed in

                        <p>F. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will take timely action to provide
                            real estate required by U.S. forces.</p>
                        <p>G. We will continue to place emphasis on population and resources
                            control.</p>
                        <p>In presenting this list to Generals <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>, we
                            would avoid giving impression of asking for new agreements or imposing
                            conditions for our increased aid commitments but would do so in context
                            of seeking reaffirmation of understandings already explicitly or tacitly
                            reached.</p>
                        <p>As to a public statement, we believe that one could be prepared which
                            would be acceptable to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, making
                            the following points:</p>
                        <p>a. Determination of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to put country on
                            a war footing and to control inflation.</p>
                        <p>b. Plans to increase forces and reduce desertion.</p>
                        <p>c. Recognition of importance of Chieu Hoi.</p>
                        <p>d. Reaffirmation of Do's four points.</p>
                        <p>To attempt to go beyond the foregoing modest program would probably be
                            unproductive. We do not want to raise conditions in terms likely to be
                            rejected or to require prolonged debate. The private assurances will be
                            no better than subsequent performance which is likely to be spotty. The
                            public statement will be viewed as government propaganda by most
                            observers. We would recommend our taking up the matter in the foregoing
                            terms at our meeting with <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>
                            scheduled for July 27. Meantime we will send the Dept. a draft of the
                            proposed public statement which we will give <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> as a suggested public release.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>: 1. Do not think it
                            advisable to go to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> with resolution
                            now. Don't need this to re-inforce peaceful intentions. Inconsistent
                            with going in with additional troops.</p>
                        <p>2. Stop talking about Vietnam—on part of President, Rusk, <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>, etc. No talking about where
                            and why we are there. Don't think they are going to be forced to table
                            by any <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> proposal. Underplay Vietnam
                            until January.</p>
                        <p>3. Both above based on this one: Don't believe we can win in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. If we send in 100,000 more, the <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> will meet us. If the <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> run out of men, the Chinese will send
                            in volunteers. Russia and China don't intend for us to win the war. If
                            we don't win, it is a catastrophe. If we lose 50,000+ it will ruin us.
                            Five years, billions of dollars, 50,000 men, it is not for us.</p>
                        <p>At end of monsoon, quietly probe and search out with other countries—by
                            moderating our position—to allow us to get out. Can't see anything but
                            catastrophe for my country. A resolution in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> with dramatic debate is bad for us.</p>

                        <p>1. Instruct officials to stop saying all humankind is at stake.</p>
                        <p>2. Stop saying we are going to pacify the country.</p>
                        <p>3. Patience—pressure—quietly marking areas we can hold. Hold these for
                            years if need be. Make a safe haven.</p>
                        <p>4. Vietcong cannot attack these places frontally.</p>
                        <p>5. Gradually stop bombings north and south. Maximum attention to it which
                            is wrong.</p>

                        <p>1. Bill Buffum tells me that, over the weekend, the President talked to
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Joe Sisco</persName> a couple times
                            about the desirability of asking for a Security Council session on
                            Vietnam to accompany the forthcoming Vietnam announcements.</p>
                        <p>2. Joe, expounding the State Department view, thought that it would not
                            be a good thing to have a Security Council session at this time; there
                            would inevitably be a debate which would lead to such things as
                            recommendations for a cessation of bombing and recommendations for
                            including the Viet Cong in any negotiations as an equal negotiating
                            party. Joe went on to suggest that we hold off on a Security Council
                            meeting and possibly have one at a later date.</p>
                        <p>3. As I understand it, the President bought the State Department
                            view.</p>

                                marking. The meeting was held in the Cabinet Room of the White
                                House. The notes were originally handwritten by <persName corresp="#p_VJ1">Valenti</persName> and later transcribed. An
                                hour before the meeting, McGeorge Bundy sent the President an agenda
                                that included: the <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> site, taking
                                Vietnam to the United Nations, a general plan for Congressional
                                consultation and a public announcement of the build-up, and further
                                consultation with the South Vietnamese Government. In a covering
                                memorandum, Bundy noted that an additional item on covert
                                negotiations was not listed on the agenda. Only he, Rusk, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> were aware of it, and all
                                felt that no one else should be informed. Bundy suggested that the
                                President might want to have a small follow-up meeting in his office
                                on the matter. (Ibid., National Security File, Memos to the
                                President, McGeorge Bundy, Vol. XII) No record of such a meeting has
                                been found.</note>

                                shot down by a surface-to-air missile launched from a mobile missile
                                site believed to be approximately 30 miles northwest of Hanoi, the

                                missiles deployed by Soviet technicians. Air reconnaissance located

                                the attack, identified as mobile sites 6 and 7 in the series of
                                    <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> sites established near
                                Hanoi. In telegram 265 from Saigon, July 25, <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> recommended an air attack
                                against the sites “to show Hanoi how seriously we view this incident
                                and to prepare political opinion for our subsequent anti-missile
                                campaign.” A copy of this telegram was sent to the President and
                                there is an indication that he saw it. (Johnson Library, National

                                26, however, <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> advised
                                against attacking the sites, since this would be seen abroad as an
                                escalation and would prejudice efforts to bring Hanoi to the
                                negotiating table. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>
                                also felt that Soviet leaders would interpret the attacks as a
                                direct challenge, requiring some sort of retaliation. (Telegram 164

                        <p>President: Any indication that there are more than five sites?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: Yes, on Friday night we
                            determined there are two more, #6 and #7. Site #4 is possibility, but 6
                            and 7 are better possibilities—more probably a mobile site.</p>
                        <p>(President asked technical questions about sites and their shoot down
                            capabilities)</p>

                            recommendation:</p>
                        <p>We don't know if any of these sites have equipment. We should attack all
                            sites. At the minimum, we should take out 4, 6, 7.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Good, but I would take
                            out only 6 and 7.</p>
                        <p>President: Where does your intelligence tell you Russians are
                            operating?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: In 6 and 7.</p>
                        <p>President: Are you sure they are Russians?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: [<hi rend="italic">less
                                than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]—that is the weight
                            of our evidence.</p>
                        <p>Rusk: I would not hit one of the sites close in to Hanoi. Only reason to
                            hit 6 and 7 is to give warning to <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>.
                            Very important if we strike that nothing be said about Russians being
                            there. Political effect of hitting 6 and 7 is a warning to not move
                            sites farther out from Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>Not at all sure we'll hit anything—they may have moved them out from
                            there.</p>
                        <p>Intensify reconnaissance to see if we can pick up anything.</p>
                        <p>President: Are we photoing regularly?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Yes, but we are
                            careful over Hanoi. We are using drones more.</p>
                        <p>President: What are you getting out of this?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: No reports of radar
                            activity at these sites.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: This is the first time
                            we have heard their radar.</p>
                        <p>President: How much personnel?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: About 1/2.</p>
                        <p>President: How provocative will this be?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: When they sent up the
                            missiles, they expected something.</p>
                        <p>President: What would be our reaction to the Russians bombing our
                            sites?</p>
                        <p>Rusk: Various indications that if Russians and US collide, it would be
                            dangerous. Killing the first Russians—[<hi rend="italic">1-1/2 lines of
                                source text not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>(Here President admonished the group NOT to speak to anyone about this.
                            “This is a war—and the stakes are high”.)</p>
                        <p>President: You think, Dean, we should take out the sites even though the
                            Russians are there?</p>

                        <p>Rusk: I think it would be a warning.</p>
                        <p>President: (I want the Secretary of State to draw up a document saying
                            that if anyone wants to write article for <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> he
                            cannot participate.)</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: This is a very hard
                            decision. But our intelligence is not very hard at this time.</p>
                        <p>There is no way to keep from identifying the casualties as Russians.</p>
                        <p>Before we make this decision I'd like to know if we take out 6 and 7
                            there is something there to take out.</p>
                        <p>Can we make some efforts to find out what is there. We don't have to take
                            them the next day. If they are building an outer perimeter, then we have
                            to take them out.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: We have already
                            identified this site. Discussed low level rekky—staff advised against it
                            because they will get out after rekky.</p>
                        <p>President: The assumption is in your favor, but we don't know exactly
                            where the missiles came from.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: I don't see the logic
                            to <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s argument—If we strike
                            and they are not there.</p>
                        <p>President: Get bad story if we roam around and find nothing</p>
                        <p>Bundy: We haven't addressed the question of turning [possible omission in
                            the source text]. See advantage of not crossing this bridge until after
                            making Presidential Statement.</p>
                        <p>President: Let's not assume I am to make a speech. No one has decided
                            that.</p>
                        <p>Bundy: Rapidity of action in Pleiku gave Russians a talking point. Is our
                            position affecting these sites better later than now—then take them out
                            on our way to munitions plant. Can see advantage if we punish <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> sites quickly. Also reports are saying
                            we shouldn't have let them go this long.</p>
                        <p>Don't see the merit of waiting. The target is on authorized list—current
                            Rolling Thunder list.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Record shows there is
                            military purpose for going over these targets now.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: If we move promptly it will
                            be a decision to step up war. In present heated tension of this decision
                            making, this step will be viewed as a decision break-through—this will
                            be a world impression.</p>

                        <p>We ought not let domestic politics guide us in making a small war

                        <p>President: <persName corresp="#p_HRN1">Helms</persName>, do you have any

                            possibility it could have come from 4?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: Our pilots'
                            intelligence—and depending on navigation—there is possibility it came
                            from 4 or mobile site.</p>
                        <p>President: How liberally is it mobile?</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: According to Russian

                        <p>President: One of the great dangers is conveying wrong message by letting
                            enemy miscalculate our motives. What will be reaction of enemy if he can
                            knock down US planes and we do nothing about it? The sites are put there
                            to destroy us. Are we going to sit and sit and let them knock down our
                            planes? Are we going to let them move first?</p>
                        <p>Bundy: Let's see if the sites impede Rolling Thunder.</p>
                        <p>(<persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> went over map to point
                            out targets)</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: It is difficult for the
                            public to distinguish between 6 and 7 and the rest. What will be
                            Russians reaction to this? This is what they have given to <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>. Where will they go for future?</p>
                        <p>May be a specific reaction to pinpointing the target. Do we know enough
                            out of this episode—is it worthwhile to know how these sites are <pb n="244" xml:id="pg_244" facs="0276"/>to be utilized? Is this their
                            policy—or is it a gesture? Is it definitely their policy or is it a
                            trigger happy officer?</p>
                        <p>Public reaction would be—this is Hanoi area.</p>
                        <p>Bundy: I don't think we are facing a confrontation with the Russians that
                            Amb. <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> suggests. I am
                            attracted by the notion of waiting until we have to go. Real risk if we
                            seem to be diverted by this episode—too much of our plans are
                            operationally known by our military.</p>
                        <p>President: Why do we ferret out ammo dumps, etc. and lose men—and fail to
                            take out something that is more dangerous like SAM site. How do you
                            justify this. You bring bombing to a standstill. If you are to continue
                            bombing these targets, how can we not take out <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s.</p>
                        <p>Rusk: You cannot order pilots to bomb without helping them get back. We
                            don't know enough about sites.</p>
                        <p>President: Then we ought to cancel targets—we can't send pilots over the
                            missile sites.</p>
                        <p>V. Pres: We ought to face up to Russian involvement. What impact this
                            will have on Russian relations, I don't know. All the press knows the
                            Russians are in the site business.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> says if we delay it will
                            aggravate situation. They have to be taken out. If I were forced to
                            decide, then if targets are to be kept, take out sites. If targets can
                            be altered, 2 or 3 days later is not a matter of significance.</p>
                        <p>We can't leave ourselves without response. But I think we can allow
                            ourselves a little time.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: We simply have to
                            change targets—we can't keep target schedules with sites in. We are not
                            going to learn anything more in the next 2 or 3 days.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName>: Information on these
                            sites was obtained on July 20. First read-out did not read out sites.
                            Finally disclosed on Saturday morning, July 24. Will take coordinated
                            intelligence effort to sort out where these sites are. This effort is
                            underway—using all kinds of intelligence information to come up with
                            answer.</p>
                        <p>Until the effort is completed, I would recommend not going in. We know 6
                            and 7 are manned.</p>

                            properly, at low altitude, we will be protected from 8, 9, 10.</p>
                        <p>There are two problems: Should we take out 6 and 7 now—or wait.</p>
                        <p>My decision on taking out 6 and 7 depends on taking out Rolling Thunder
                            targets—as well as telling the Russians we won't allow them to
                            conclude—we won't do anything.</p>
                        <p>We don't want to send planes to Rolling Thunder targets if they must be
                            shot down.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: My view is that when

                            on <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> with help of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. People don't understand sophisticated complexities of
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> politics. They do understand their
                            President asking for unconditional talks. Sometimes the public
                            exhibition of an attitude can start us on the way. I would hope we would
                            do the necessary exploration to get the votes—by consulting with our
                            friends. Some dangers may turn out to be virtues—such as Viet Cong. I
                            think there is great advantage in President's saying simply we want to
                            talk.</p>
                        <p>President: I said that in San Francisco.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: Even though I don't
                            expect Russians to say in advance “Yes”, but it doesn't mean they won't
                            come around to this view.</p>
                        <p>I think we need a new initiative—the effects of President's Baltimore
                            speech have worn off. What would be the worst that could happen to us in
                            the Security Council? Are we so lacking in friends that we won't be
                            applauded? There must be equity in the final agreement.</p>
                        <p>If I thought the war could go on quietly—then I would acquiesce—but I
                            don't think the war can go on quietly. As we send in more troops—knock
                            out <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s—something must happen in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and I want us to be the plaintiff, not
                            the defendant.</p>
                        <p>Rusk: <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is an organization to which we
                            have a treaty commitment. We have an obligation to use the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as effectively as we know. But Hanoi and
                            Peking are not parties to this organization.</p>
                        <p>Advantages: Help placate our critics.</p>
                        <p>Disadvantages: Can't see how they would help. Maximum benefit is to

                        <p>President: I'm tired of words. I've been giving words for 20 months. I
                            told the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in San Francisco that I would
                            back any effort by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to bring this
                            to the conference table.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>: We had to show the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> that what we are doing is entirely
                            consistent with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> charter.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>: <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> makes a persuasive case. But I
                            am unalterably opposed to a resolution in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. But we are in a paradox. On one hand, we are ready to
                            meet commitments, but we are really ready to get out. We can almost
                            guarantee that a resolution would fail. The Soviets must stand by the
                                <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>. I see them using the resolution
                            as a propaganda asset—using bombing and white-vs.-Asians. Talking at
                            this time publicly will not accomplish anything. If it is underplayed,
                            we have a chance to justify our views.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>: We have already
                            explained why we are there. We cannot win the war in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. China and Russia don't intend for us
                            to win the war. They will match us in manpower. No matter how many men
                            we send, they will match us.</p>
                        <p>The great danger is that additional troops are not [sic] a notice to the
                            world that we intend to make it a land war.</p>
                        <p>We should get through the monsoon season and quietly see if we can work

                        <p>2. It must also be understood with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            that we do not reject 1954 Geneva Accords. While question remains open

                        <p>4. Suggest rewording Point A public statement to eliminate implication

                        <p>5. Public statement should also include some reference to economic and

                            the efforts of the Vietnamese people themselves. It is fully agreed and
                            understood between that Government and the US that the main effort in

                        <p>“In this last week the situation in Viet-Nam and the actions it requires
                            have again been reviewed. This has been the most careful and sustained
                            review that has been made at any time since President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> took office. The President has
                            discussed the problem with members of the Cabinet—Secretary Rusk,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>. He has discussed it
                            with distinguished Americans in private life who have earned the thanks
                            of their country by earlier service, like Mr. Arthur Dean and Mr. John
                            McCloy. He has had the advice of two great Ambassadors, <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Maxwell Taylor</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Henry Cabot Lodge</persName>. He has talked at
                            length with the leaders of the Senate and the House of Representatives.
                            By personal messages and diplomatic discussions the problem has been
                            reviewed with friends and allies in foreign countries. Out of these
                            deliberations have come three important decisions—</p>
                        <p>The first is that US policy and purpose in Viet-Nam are sound and
                            right.</p>
                        <p>The second is that the US must now take important additional military
                            measures in support of that policy and purpose.</p>
                        <p>The third is that the US should continue and intensify its diplomatic
                            search for peace.</p>
                        <p>The US purpose and policy in Viet-Nam are right. The US is there to keep
                            a promise. That promise was and is to help the people and Government of
                            South Viet-Nam to help themselves against attack supported from outside.
                            This American commitment must and will be kept—both for its own sake and
                            for its meaning to world peace. For the peace of the world cannot be
                            kept if there is not respect for the given word of the United States of
                            America.</p>
                        <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0282"/>
                        <p>But there is more to it than that. South Viet-Nam is not the only small
                            state which is threatened by external pressure and ambition. It is not
                            the only country menaced by subversion and infiltration and terror. If
                            South Viet-Nam is lost, then others are weakened.</p>
                        <p>And finally, the US is there because it has a deep and enduring national
                            interest in preventing the Communist conquest of Asia. It seeks nothing
                            in Asia for itself, but the independence of the peoples of Asia is
                            essential to the peace of the world and to American security itself.</p>
                        <p>In pursuit of these great purposes, the US has supported and sustained
                            its friends in Asia for a quarter of a century, in war and in peace. It
                            has respected their choice of neutrality or alignment. It has respected
                            their right to determine their own political and social systems. It has
                            helped them to resist aggression—whether by open attack as in Korea, or
                            by bombardment and threat as in the Formosa Straits, or by the more
                            complex and destructive methods now in use against Viet-Nam. This course
                            of action has been right, and it is right today.</p>
                        <p>And now it is necessary that the US increase its effort in Viet-Nam. The
                            battles of the spring and early summer have brought heavy losses to both
                            sides. It is clear that over a period of many months there has been a
                            growth in the infiltration of Communist forces from North Viet-Nam. The
                            armed forces of South Viet-Nam continue to fight with great courage and
                            with growing skill. But they need more help, and they will get it.</p>
                        <p>Authorization has been given today for the movement to South Viet-Nam of
                            additional forces which will bring US total troop strength in that
                            country to 175,000 men by November. These enlarged forces will provide
                            34 combat battalions, 24 air squadrons, and 31 helicopter companies.
                            Under the command of General Westmoreland—an officer who has earned the
                            confidence of all his countrymen—these forces will be used where they
                            are needed. And they will fight.</p>
                        <p>Like every action the US has taken in Viet-Nam, these new deployments are
                            ordered at the request of the Government of Viet-Nam and in support of
                            the efforts of the Vietnamese people themselves. It is fully agreed and
                            understood between that Government and the US that the main effort in
                            South Viet-Nam must still be made by the Vietnamese themselves.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> has been
                            assured that as US efforts are increased the Vietnamese Government
                            itself is reenforcing its own measures to build up its armed forces and
                            to meet the economic pressures caused by war. That Government is
                            reaffirming its determination and announcing its own programs of
                            increasing action at home, including certain measures in the economic
                            and social fields to enhance the solidarity of the Vietnamese people and
                            their government in their critical efforts.</p>
                        <p>The decisions announced today are decisions to do what is necessary—and
                            only what is necessary. This has been US policy; it is US policy <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0283"/>still. These new and increased
                            actions are made necessary by the growing battlefield action of
                            others.</p>
                        <p>The ever closer partnership of the US with the people and Government of
                            Viet-Nam is the inevitable answer which the US gives, with them, to the
                            increasing efforts of the attackers. Yet the purpose remains unchanged.
                            And it is a purpose of peace.</p>
                        <p>While the US does all that is necessary to turn back the attackers in
                            South Viet-Nam, it will do all that is possible to open the path to
                            peaceful settlement. Again and again it has said that it is ready for
                            unconditional discussion. The US and others have made fifteen efforts to
                            get discussion started. These efforts have all been rejected out of
                            hand. But the US will not be discouraged.</p>
                        <p>In these last days, messages have been sent to all the more than 30
                            countries that have given concrete evidence of their concern for the
                            people of South Viet-Nam. It has been emphasized again that just as
                            there is need for wider effort to resist aggression, there is equal need
                            for further effort to open doors to peace. America's friends in these
                            countries know that all their efforts to this end are welcome to the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>And the US will do more. Today Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> has been instructed to consult most urgently
                            with the Secretary General of the United Nations to see if there is not
                            some way in which the good offices of the United Nations can be engaged
                            for peace in Viet-Nam.<note n="3" xml:id="d89fn3">See <ref target="#d99">Document 99</ref>.</note> The earlier efforts of the Secretary
                            General have met with rebuff, but no possibility of progress must be
                            overlooked. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>
                            will make it entirely plain that the United States continues to hope
                            that a way can be found to bring the United Nations into action in
                            Viet-Nam. The Ambassador will submit a full report on US actions there
                            and its purpose of peace, both formally to the Security Council and
                            informally to all the Delegates who seek to know the US stand. If it
                            proves possible to engage the United Nations in Viet-Nam, the United
                            States will actively support that engagement.</p>
                        <p>At the same time that the US seeks by every means to start the
                            discussions that can bring peace, it and its friends in South Viet-Nam
                            are making it plain that they are ready for the kind of peace that will
                            be fair and honorable for all. Already in June, the Foreign Minister of
                            Viet-Nam and the Secretary of State of the United States have stated for
                            all to hear the fundamental principles of such a peace:</p>
                        <p>An end to aggression and subversion.</p>
                        <p>Freedom for South Viet-Nam to choose and shape its own destiny by
                            democratic principles and without foreign interference.</p>
                        <p>An end of the military measures now made necessary by aggression, and the
                            removal of foreign military forces from South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0284"/>
                        <p>And effective guarantees for the independence and freedom of the people
                            of South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>Beyond these principles, it has been made clear that the US looks forward
                            to the day when relations between North Viet-Nam and South Viet-Nam can
                            be worked out by peaceful means—including a free decision by the peoples
                            of all Viet-Nam on the matter of reunification. These principles imply
                            and include the use of free election under international supervision,
                            just as soon as the end of aggression permits.</p>
                        <p>These purposes in essence are the purposes of the Geneva Agreements of
                            1954. The failure of the 1954 Agreements was not in purpose but in
                            practice—not in the quality of the objectives, but in the effectiveness
                            of the instruments. When there is a new settlement in Southeast Asia, it
                            must be based on stronger and more lasting guarantees than those of
                            1954.</p>
                        <p>But the purpose of peace remains as the US has stated it. The program of
                            peace remains the same. And the program meets the interests of all who
                            have a stake in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>For the people of South Viet-Nam—on both sides of the current contest—it
                            will bring opportunity for an active and honorable part in the peaceful
                            life of a freely growing society.</p>
                        <p>For the people and Government of North Viet-Nam it will bring relief from
                            the burdens of war and a prospect of new and peaceful relations with the
                            people to the south.</p>
                        <p>For the smaller neighbors of Viet-Nam it will mean an end to the danger
                            of nearby warfare and a widened prospect of peaceful development for the
                            whole area.</p>
                        <p>For the people and Government on the Mainland of China, this plan of
                            peace contains no threat and no danger.</p>
                        <p>And on a still wider plane, a peace so clearly fair and reasonable for
                            all can remove a clear obstacle to understanding between all of these
                            who call themselves Communists and all of those who don't.</p>
                        <p>For the real future of Southeast Asia is a future of peaceful progress,
                            not a future of contest and conquest. While the US resists
                            aggression—and probes for peace—it is planning for progress. Already
                            there has been an encouraging response to the proposals put forward in
                            April. The prospects for Asian development are good, and US readiness to
                            help has been made plain.</p>
                        <p>So today America appeals once again to those who have chosen the path of
                            battle. Let them turn from terror to talk, and from subversion to
                            settlement. Let all interested governments go to the conference table
                            and let them bring with them any other parties that they choose. The US
                            will come with its proposals—let them come with theirs. And let
                            diplomacy replace destruction. The first business of such a conference
                            must be to <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0285"/>work out terms that
                            can permit an end of fighting. Its final business must be peace. The
                            Government of Viet-Nam and the Government of the United States are
                            ready.</p>
                        <p>This readiness comes not from weakness but from strength—not from
                            weariness but from resolution. Until there is a settlement and an end of
                            aggression, America's efforts will go on and they will grow.</p>
                        <p>The deployments ordered today will be carried out. The Americans who go
                            to Viet-Nam will do their duty. The forces of the United States will
                            carry out the order to resist and to punish aggression. The US is ready
                            for honorable peace, but it will persevere in the hard task of battle
                            until others are ready, too.”</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Nothing has developed
                            in our intelligence to show us any new data on missile sites.</p>
                        <p>
                            <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0286"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>: As long as it looks as
                            if the sites are all not Hanoi we are going after, I think their
                            reaction will be mild. We should not say they are manned by Soviets—need
                            to fuzz that up. It would be good if we can tie it in with something
                            else.</p>
                        <p>President: Would you take out ammunition dumps and sites
                            simultaneously?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Take them out
                            separately.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: Chiefs would take out
                            all 7 sites at one time. If not, take out 4, 6, 7. There is the
                            possibility that #4 was mixed up in this shoot-down.</p>
                        <p>President: Why against #4, Bob?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: #4 is a part of the
                            Hanoi-Haiphong package. It would vex the Soviets. It is not directly
                            associated with Lao Chi and ammunition dump. There is no operational
                            need to take it out. It is too close to the Migs and would increase the
                            number of aircraft in the air. We have never hit a <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> site and there is no need to make a
                            difficult target more difficult. The chances of success are not perfect.
                            They are about 50-50.</p>
                        <p>President: If you find them, can you destroy them?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Yes, if we find them.
                            However, we have narrow field of vision at 500 mph.</p>
                        <p>President: If you go in, lose planes and fail to get them, how will we
                            look in the eyes of the world?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: I foresee no problem
                            there.</p>
                        <p>President: Is <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> like Hawk?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: It is a big van, high
                            mass of radar—missiles like Nike-Hercules.</p>
                        <p>Rusk: Would the cap come in only if Migs react?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Possibly, because of
                            lack of friend-or-foe identification, they may shoot our planes if they
                            are present.</p>
                        <p>President: How far away are the Migs?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: The Migs are 25-40
                            miles away.</p>
                        <p>President: What protection do we have against Migs?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: Our cap—F4C—8 F104. Two
                            levels of defense.</p>
                        <p>President: Please summarize the pros and cons of going in to take out
                                <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: (Brought situation up
                            to date chronologically)</p>
                        <p>We think we should take out 6 and 7 because they lie athwart targets on
                            our authorized list. If we don't, we will give an incorrect reading to
                            Soviets that we are willing to omit targets because of <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s. It is hard to explain to Congress and
                            the people that we will take out ammo depots but not <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> sites.</p>
                        <pb n="255" xml:id="pg_255" facs="0287"/>
                        <p>Rusk: While these sites are under attack, will radar be on them?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Yes. We have changed
                            authorized routes.</p>
                        <p>President: What about terrain or low level?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: It is relatively flat
                            in that area.</p>
                        <p>Rusk: I see some advantage to striking other targets. However, it is
                            unlikely we'll find anything to hit. They will have moved. I wouldn't
                            rely on clearing out a path for the future. In terms of signals to the
                            other side, would strike them and other targets quickly.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: I would not complicate
                            matters by hitting targets simultaneously. That's very difficult
                            mission.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>: (In response to question
                            from President) I would be in favor of hitting 6 and 7 and hitting ammo
                            targets as soon as practical.</p>
                        <p>President: Any objections to <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s recommendation to hit?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: No objection to
                            recommendation, but let's have no illusions that it will not cause
                            tremors of tension around the world. Raise question of whether to take
                            out all sites then troop deployment, etc.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: If Migs came out to
                            attack us, we must destroy them.</p>
                        <p>President: Would you pursue in case of fight?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: No. Right now the
                            orders are to fight only in the air.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: In light of danger of
                            Soviet involvement; intelligence is not sure #4 is not involved; not
                            sure <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> is not mobile; I think we ought
                            to know they are there and #6 and #7 are the responsible ones before
                            making this attack.</p>
                        <p>I would send another memo to attack the target to make sure if they are
                            knocked down that the <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> site is
                            active.</p>
                        <p>President: You don't mean sending boys over that <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> site?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName>: We support Amb.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> 100%. Our Soviet
                            experts tell us they are expecting us to come in.</p>
                        <p>President: If we don't take them out, I want targets off list. If we do
                            take them out, we can go on to better targets. I don't want to send boys
                            over those sites where we know they will be shot down. We may be
                            mis-leading Russians again. Kennedy called up reserves and put nation on
                            war footing after Vienna and Soviets understood that. In missile crisis
                            they understood that.</p>
                        <p>For 20 months we have been restrained—and I don't want them to
                            misunderstand us. Only pressure we can have is our bombing. We have
                            nothing else to bargain.</p>
                        <p>Can we find the targets—sites?</p>
                        <p>Rusk: What happens if we incur additional losses from Migs? We should not
                            make any decisions now to go into Hanoi-Haiphong area. If <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0288"/>we do, we will be moving into something
                            by mistake. I would think hard about going into Hanoi to kill Migs.</p>
                        <p>President: This is not the subject of this meeting. Before we do that,
                            you'll be heard.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>: We are not going to be
                            pushed out of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. We show enemy our
                            determination by taking out #6 and #7.</p>
                        <p>Bargaining: Most valuable asset <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> has
                            is the industrial complex they have laboriously built. If they think
                                <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s can protect their industry,
                            they have won an important element. We have no bargaining point if their
                            industry is safe.</p>
                        <p>If Soviets put their men and material into a situation that knocks down
                            American planes, they must expect retaliation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>: On balance, I support
                            the recommendation.</p>
                        <p>Bundy: We ought to examine the way we'll discuss this decision.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RC1">Rowan</persName>: We ought to understand that
                            this will increase the “crisis atmosphere”. Every European newspaper
                            takes it for granted that Russians shot down our plane. I say that even
                            though I support the recommendation to knock them out.</p>
                        <p>The press reaction in Europe is bound to make the Soviets feel they have
                            lost prestige if we knock out the sites.</p>
                        <p>V. Pres: I'm much impressed with what <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName> said about long term prospects. If these
                            targets are valuable, we have to do something about what blocks us. I am
                            concerned that we have changed emphasis—that we do indeed have mobile
                            units to face.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: We are
                            over-emphasizing the mobility of these units. They are semi-mobile. They
                            haven't been mobile in the 99% cases we have examined.</p>
                        <p>President: How long would it take to go?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: If we gave “go” in the

                        <p>V. Pres: <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> sites #6 and #7 ought to be

                                strike aircraft were scheduled to attack <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> missile sites 6 and 7 that night. (Johnson Library,
                                National Security File, Country File, Vietnam, Vol. XXXVII, Memos
                                (B)) A subsequent situation report for the President, prepared at
                                6:40 a.m., July 27, indicated that the <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> sites and their associated barracks had been
                                struck, and the pilots reported the destruction of site 6. The
                                results of the attack on site 7 were not clear. Six F-105 aircraft
                                were reported lost in the attack. (Ibid.) Both reports have
                                indications that the President saw them. On August 3, R.C. Bowman
                                sent a memorandum to McGeorge Bundy in which he noted that the
                                attacks on the <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> sites “may have
                                been a <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> trap.” Site 6, he noted,
                                was evidently a dummy site, and there was probably no equipment at
                                site 7. He added that General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> had proposed to <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> that strike aircraft be given authority to
                                attack mobile <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> sites wherever
                                they were discovered outside the Hanoi area. (Ibid.)</note> (Given

                            relations by peaceful <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0290"/>means,
                            including especially last sentence on elections and (3) paragraph on
                            Geneva agreements.</p>
                        <p>With respect to first point, they accepted our explanation that, although
                            it was not likely constructive <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> role
                            could be found, it was important we demonstrate that we have exhausted
                            every possibility to that end.</p>
                        <p>It was notable that <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName>, as
                            well as others, accepted second point. On question of elections, they
                            accepted fact that Communists never have accepted international
                            supervision of elections and can be expected to oppose in future.
                            However they were somewhat bothered by inclusion of last phrase “just as
                            soon as the end of aggression permits” and it seems to us that sentence
                            is just as strong with omission of this phrase.</p>
                        <p>Longest discussion revolved around Geneva agreements with <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName> making spirited exposition to
                            effect that their “honor and political situation” did not permit them to
                            recognize binding effect of document which French sought to impose upon
                            them by signature of French General. We pointed out basic
                            incompatibility of seeking to invoke Geneva Accords against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> on one hand while on other hand denying
                            their validity. <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName> said they
                            could accept the “factual situation” created in 1954 by the Geneva
                            Accords but <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could not change what
                            had been consistent and basic position of all <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s since 1954. However <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> said that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could
                            take position that, while <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had not
                            signed accords, they had always and would continue to respect their
                            principles. <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName> concurred and
                            suggested that there be added to any such public position by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had not and would not seek reunification of country by
                            military means. We concurred that this was sound and defensible position
                            for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.During course of discussion
                                <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName>, as well as <persName corresp="#p_Co1">Co</persName>, concurred that best possible outcome
                            of present struggle might be that the war would passively “fade away”,
                            that is, there would be a return to the de facto 1954 situation and thus
                            that “stronger and more lasting guarantees of 1954” which could
                            presumably be obtained only through general conference were also not
                            necessarily best outcome. We thus suggest consideration to deleting
                            modifying sentence in which that phrase appears.</p>
                        <p>Although Vietnamese did not catch or raise point, we question next to
                            last two sentences of third paragraph from end, that is, sentence
                            reading, “The first business of such a conference must be to work out
                            terms that can permit an end of fighting. Its final business must be
                            peace.” Thus it seems to us these sentences unnecessarily raise spectre
                            of “cease fire” without effective agreement from other side.</p>

                            and <persName corresp="#p_Co1">Co</persName>'s affirmation on points of

                            forward and gives us a good political punch to go with our military

                            presentation by Secretary Rusk. What is new in these paragraphs is the
                            following:</p>
                        <p>(1) An explicit affirmation that we are in favor of using the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> if we can get it into the act.</p>
                        <p>(2) An explicit affirmation that we are in favor of free elections under
                            international supervision.</p>
                        <p>(3) Definite and clear-cut support for the purposes (but not the weak
                            machinery) of the '54 agreements.</p>
                        <p>(4) An offer of hope for the Viet Cong if they will turn from war to
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>(5) A concrete offer to discuss both their proposals and ours—this will
                            be read as movement toward a negotiation in which their points and our
                            points would both be on the table.</p>
                        <p>All these are important from the point of view of men like <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName>. A couple of them—like the
                            offer to consider their proposals and the offer of hope for the Viet
                            Cong after a peaceful settlement—may have real impact in Communist
                            circles as well. Yet there is no weakness in them. And I repeat that
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> has obtained Saigon's
                            approval for them.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The President: Before formalizing decisions on the deployment of
                            additional U.S. forces to Vietnam, he wished to review the present
                            situation with Council members present. Secretary Rusk will deal with
                            the political situation and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> will describe the military situation.</p>
                        <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261" facs="0293"/>
                        <p>Secretary Rusk:</p>
                        <p>a. The Chinese Communists are most adamant against any negotiations
                            between the North Vietnamese and the U.S./South Vietnamese. The clash
                            between the Chinese Communists and the Russians continues.</p>
                        <p>b. According to the Yugoslav Ambassador, <persName corresp="#p_TM2">Tito</persName> got the impression during his visit to Moscow that
                            “things would happen” if we stopped the bombing of North Vietnam. We
                            have asked many times what the North Vietnamese would do if we stopped
                            the bombing. We have heard nothing to date in reply.</p>
                        <p>c. There appear to be elements of caution on the other side—in Hanoi as
                            well as in Moscow. Our purpose is to keep our contacts open with the
                            other side in the event that they have a new position to give us.</p>
                        <p>d. The U.S. actions we are taking should be presented publicly in a low
                            key but in such a way as to convey accurately that we are determined to
                            prevent South Vietnam from being taken over by Hanoi. At the same time,
                            we seek to avoid a confrontation with either the Chinese Communists or
                            the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Summarized
                            the military situation in Vietnam:</p>
                        <p>a. The number of Viet Cong forces has increased and the percentage of
                            these forces committed to battle has increased.</p>
                        <p>b. The geographic area of South Vietnam controlled by the Viet Cong has
                            increased.</p>
                        <p>c. The Viet Cong have isolated the cities and disrupted the economy of
                            South Vietnam. The cities are separated from the countryside.</p>
                        <p>d. Increased desertions from the South Vietnamese Army have prevented an
                            increase in the total number of South Vietnamese troops available for
                            combat.</p>
                        <p>e. About half of all U.S. Army helicopters are now in South Vietnam in
                            addition to over 500 U.S. planes.</p>
                        <p>The military requirements are:</p>
                        <p>a. More combat battalions from the U.S. are necessary. A total of 13
                            additional battalions need to be sent now. On June 15, we announced a
                            total of 75,000 men, or 15 battalions.</p>
                        <p>b. A total of 28 battalions is now necessary.</p>
                        <p>c. Over the next 15 months, 350,000 men would be added to regular U.S.
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>d. In January, we would go to Congress for a supplementary appropriation
                            to pay the costs of the Vietnam war. We would ask now for a billion, in
                            addition to the existing 1966 budget. (Draft plan is attached as Tab

                        <p>The attack on the <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> sites in North
                            Vietnam was necessary to protect our planes. Attacks on other priority
                            targets in North Vietnam are required.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>: Asked whether
                            the ratio of government to guerrilla ground forces had to be 10:1.
                            During his testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he
                            had been asked this question. Comment had been made about the
                            astronomical size of U.S. forces required if this traditional 10:1 ratio
                            was valid.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: The mobility and
                            fire power of U.S. and South Vietnamese forces has put an imponderable
                            element into the traditional ratio of 10:1. Perhaps 4:1 is the right
                            ratio.</p>
                        <p>With the additional forces to be sent to South Vietnam, General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> believes we can hold our
                            present position and possibly move back into areas now contested. The
                            one exception would be in the Fourth Corps.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Rusk and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> expressed differences of view concerning a map
                            brought to the meeting by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> which purported to show the amount of territory
                            in South Vietnam controlled by the Viet Cong. Secretary Rusk thought the
                            map overstated the size of Viet Cong controlled areas. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said it understated
                            the area they control. At least 26% of the population of South Vietnam
                            is controlled by Viet Cong, according to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s figures.</p>
                        <p>(The meeting was interrupted briefly to permit the photographers to take
                            pictures.)</p>
                        <p>The President: The situation in Vietnam is deteriorating. Even though we
                            now have 80 to 90,000 men there, the situation is not very safe. We have
                            these choices:</p>
                        <p>a. Use our massive power, including <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>,
                            to bring the enemy to his knees. Less than 10% of our people urge this
                            course of action.</p>
                        <p>b. We could get out on the grounds that we don't belong there. Not very
                            many people feel this way about Vietnam. Most feel that our national
                            honor is at stake and that we must keep our commitments there.<note n="3" xml:id="d93fn3">According to <persName corresp="#p_VJ1">Valenti</persName>'s notes of the meeting, Johnson also said at
                                this point: “Ike, Kennedy and I have given commitment.”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>c. We could keep our forces at the present level, approximately 80,000
                            men, but suffer the consequences of losing additional territory and of
                            accepting increased casualties.<note n="4" xml:id="d93fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_VJ1">Valenti</persName>'s notes indicate the
                                President said at this point: “You wouldn't want your boy to be out
                                there and crying for help and not get it.”</note> We could “hunker
                            up”. No one is recommending this course.</p>
                        <pb n="263" xml:id="pg_263" facs="0295"/>
                        <p>d. We could ask for everything we might desire from Congress—money,
                            authority to call up the reserves, acceptance of the deployment of more
                            combat battalions. This dramatic course of action would involve
                            declaring a state of emergency and a request for several billion
                            dollars. Many favor this course. However, if we do go all out in this
                            fashion, Hanoi would be able to ask the Chinese Communists and the
                            Soviets to increase aid and add to their existing commitments.</p>
                        <p>e. We have chosen to do what is necessary to meet the present situation,
                            but not to be unnecessarily provocative to either the Russians or the
                            Communist Chinese. We will give the commanders the men they say they
                            need and, out of existing materiel in the U.S., we will give them the
                            materiel they say they need. We will get the necessary money in the new
                            budget and will use our transfer authority until January. We will
                            neither brag about what we are doing nor thunder at the Chinese
                            Communists and the Russians.<note n="5" xml:id="d93fn5">
                                <persName corresp="#p_VJ1">Valenti</persName> notes that Johnson
                                added at this point that the United States should say to <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName>: “You and your military
                                help us there and make what gains we can. Meanwhile, we will explore
                                ways to find peace.”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>This course of action will keep us there during the critical monsoon
                            season and possibly result in some gains. Meanwhile, we will push on the
                            diplomatic side. This means that we will use up our manpower reserves.
                            We will not deplete them, but there will be a substantial reduction.
                            Quietly, we will push up the level of our reserve force.<note n="6" xml:id="d93fn6">

                        <p>Present were the President, Secretaries Rusk and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>, Senators <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>, Dirksen, <persName corresp="#p_HBB1">Hickenlooper</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SGA1">Smathers</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KTH1">Kuchel</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_LRB1">Long</persName>;
                            Speaker <persName corresp="#p_MCJW1">McCormack</persName>,
                            Representatives <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_ALC1">Arends</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boggs</persName>, and Albert, and from the White House—Richard
                            Goodwin, <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Moyers</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BH3">Busby</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_VJ1">Valenti</persName>, O'Brien, <persName corresp="#p_CSD1">Cater</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CJA1">Califano</persName>
                            and Bundy.</p>
                        <p>The President began by outlining the five possible choices: first, to
                            blow them up—not much thought had been given to that.</p>
                        <p>Second, that we ought to get out. Some people felt that way but did not
                            really come out and say what they thought until you pursued them.</p>
                        <p>Third, we could leave things just as they are with 80,000 to 90,000 men
                            there today and get <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> out
                            there and see if he can pull a rabbit out of the hat.</p>
                        <p>Fourth, we could declare an emergency, call in the reserves, thousands of
                            men and billions of dollars—tell the country that our best guess was Y
                            billion dollars and X thousand men, and ask for it. That course had a
                            good deal of appeal to the President because we should do what is
                            needed, but there is an argument against it in the possible reaction of
                            Hanoi. We did not want to have things get more violent just as we have a
                            new man going to the U.N. We have hints from the Russians what we should
                            take account of. The President did not want to make this any more
                            provocative than necessary. He had reasons for not overstating the case.
                            He did not himself believe that you can simply get in an airplane and
                            settle this thing.</p>
                        <p>The fifth choice would be to supply <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> with the men and materials he had
                            requested, increase draft calls (the notes say 17-20, 24-28-35), extend
                            enlistment of sailors and marines, and go into the Senate for an
                            additional appropriation of $1 or $2 billion and defer a full
                            presentation of requirements until January, 1966. By then we would be
                            through the monsoon. In the meantime, the Congress would keep its power
                            to call itself back into session. Maybe by then we would be past the
                            monsoon and the Communists would have further thoughts. If the Russians
                                <pb n="265" xml:id="pg_265" facs="0297"/>did not come in and if
                            China was not gambling we might be able to say “Cut out your foolishness
                            and come to the conference table.” The President didn't think there was
                            much chance of an early settlement but others kept saying we've got to
                            try even though we have tried fifteen times. Before the President went
                            into the districts of the Congressmen and Senators he would have done
                            what Westy and <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> want
                            done. Meanwhile he would lay plans for more reserves. The President also
                            reported that the British pound was in great danger.</p>
                        <p>In summary the President said the choice was between course four and
                            course five. Either way he would give General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> what he wants. One course
                            would be to go the full Congressional route now and the other way is to
                            give the Congressional leadership the story now and the bill later.
                            Concluding his presentation, the President said that he was prepared to
                            stay in the meeting just as long as members of the Leadership
                            wanted.</p>
                        <p>The President was followed by the Secretary of State who gave a political
                            analysis. He pointed out that there was no real reason for a basic
                            difference between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. on Vietnam, but that Moscow
                            had no real influence on the ground. Furthermore, Moscow had a dilemma
                            because of other Communist pressures. At the other end of the spectrum
                            was Peking which was adamant against negotiations—bitter and harsh.</p>
                        <p>(At this point Bundy was out of the meeting getting certain “Ike papers”
                            for the President. When he returned the notes pick up again.)</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> was discussing
                            the <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>-site problem.</p>
                        <p>The President then called on Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> who knocked down choices one, two and
                            three—alternative one would not solve the problem, alternative two was
                            worse than a victory for the Kaiser or Hitler in the two World Wars.
                            Alternative three was no alternative at all since you needed a bigger
                            perimeter and you also needed Camranh Bay.</p>
                        <p>Congressman Albert then said that he agreed with the President's
                            proposal.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_SGA1">Smathers</persName> said that we did
                            not want to get into World War III but we did want to stay there. Was
                            there any change in this policy?</p>
                        <p>The President answered that there was no change in policy but that as
                            their effort increased, ours must.</p>
                        <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boggs</persName> asked if there
                            was any major defection of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> replied in
                            the negative. Congressman <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boggs</persName>
                            asked about the government and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said it was a weak government and would be
                            while the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> were free to attack it
                            district by district. About this point the President told the Leadership
                            why <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0298"/>he did not call the
                            Leadership earlier (the notes say that this statement was “per my memo
                            to him on <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>”).<note n="2" xml:id="d94fn2">Not further identified. </note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boggs</persName> asked why we
                            needed a ten-to-one ratio. General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> took that question and said that perhaps
                            four-to-one was a right ratio, but that ten-to-one was not necessary
                            because the helicopter had provided a new mobility and that this was why
                            the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> had been so successful until
                            recently.</p>
                        <p>The President remarked that we all know that it is a bad situation and we
                            wish we were ten years back or even ten months back.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_LRB1">Long</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> talks of a twenty-year war
                            but that he thought that it might be a hundred years long. We should
                            look at the stakes and look at the fact that we have been touched up.
                            Should we put in more men or take a whipping? We'd better go in.</p>
                        <p>The Speaker said that he did not see any alternatives. Dedicated military
                            leaders have asked for more help. He was impressed by the analogy to
                            Hitler. The road to appeasement was a road to war. We have warned them.
                            We do the things we should, hard as they are. (The notes here remark
                            that “The Leadership seems mighty hawky so far.”) The Russians had
                            problems and weaknesses of their own.</p>
                        <p>The President read parts of a message from General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> to Prime Minister Churchill
                            at a time of crisis in Vietnam in 1954. The passage the President was
                            reading came from “Mandate for Change.”<note n="3" xml:id="d94fn3">An
                                apparent reference to the April 4, 1954, letter from <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> to Churchill, which is
                                quoted in <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D.

                                1963), pp. 346-347. It is also printed in <ref target="frus1952-54v13p1">

                        </p>
                        <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> asked for
                            clarification of choices four and five. The answer (the speaker is not
                            clearly defined by the notes) was that in either case <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> would get what he wants.
                            The question was rather how you would go about the process—under four
                            you would ask funds from the Congress now and under five you would come
                            back in January and ask for them. The President said that we would ask
                            for the money in any event. We can either guess about larger figures or
                            go for a limited sum in the Senate now. He thought there were good
                            reasons for not calling the reserves; if you call them now you really
                            won't be ready.</p>
                        <p>In January you would have it better worked out. Under alternative five he
                            might tell the Leadership three times that he was sending an additional
                            30,000 or so, without saying X billion and 100,000 men if he could avoid
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Representative <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> said that
                            under alternative five you would double draft calls—and how much of a
                            burden would that place on training forces? The President said that the
                            difference between four and five <pb n="267" xml:id="pg_267" facs="0299"/>was that one was more dramatic and blunter and more powerful—if that
                            is what you wanted.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that the
                            draft calls under option five would be about the same as under option
                            four—since when we called the reserves we would still have to double the
                            draft calls. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            also pointed out that Sections 512A and C of the Appropriation Act gave
                            authority to spend money and then get a deficiency appropriation.</p>
                        <p>The President said again that under alternative four he would have to get
                            a new bill and a great big reserve plan and go through a big process.
                            Under five we would simply put $1.8 billion or whatever into the
                            appropriation bills on the Senate side and then get in order for
                            January.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of Defense said that the war was very difficult to predict,
                            that under four we would be asking for a blank check because we did not
                            know what would happen, while under five we would ask for what we see
                            clearly between now and January. Congressman <persName corresp="#p_ALC1">Arends</persName> asked what General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>'s needs were. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> answered that he had an
                            immediate requirement of thirteen battalions and 50,000 men. Beyond that
                            there would be a need for further forces before January 1. The Secretary
                            also said that we could supply forces faster than General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> could receive them. The
                            Secretary of State remarked that while there were sharp engagements, the
                            fighting had not reached the stage of Giap's phase three. The President
                            referred to a speech by the Vice President and said that we were running
                            the danger of saying to Ho what he wants to hear. He also said that he
                            did not want Russia and China in it if he could help it.</p>
                        <p>Senator Dirksen quoted President Woodrow Wilson to the effect that “the
                            business at hand is undramatic.” But the President was going to have to
                            tell the country that we are in a very serious business. There was then
                            an exchange with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, about which the notes are unclear—<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s comment was that “there was
                            more baloney on that than any other subject,” but the notes do not show
                            what he was talking about.</p>
                        <p>Senator Dirksen apparently also asked about any possible diversion (?) of
                            anticipated shipments. The President's comment is that every man who
                            leaves will be announced. Senator Dirksen noted that he was receiving
                            many questioning calls, and the President said he was going to tell the
                            country just as soon as he got through telling the Leadership. Senator
                            Dirksen said that he was not going to be like the Committee on the
                            Conduct of the War. The President said that in the morning he was going
                            to get to General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>.
                            Senator Dirksen said that from now to January was five months and you
                            could not wait that long if you need it. “If you need it you ought to
                            ask for it.” The President said that we would get what we needed. There
                            would be a sizable supplementary in January—a few billion dollars.
                            Senator Dirksen said we should make the country <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0300"/>realize that this is dangerous, serious
                            business. The President said he thought the country did realize it.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> asked the
                            President's indulgence and read a statement<note n="4" xml:id="d94fn4">Not found. </note> in which there appeared remarks about apathy,
                            disquiet, and apprehension. He thought that nothing should be put out
                            from the meeting except by the President. He said he would support the
                            President's position as a Senator and as Majority Leader.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_HBB1">Hickenlooper</persName> asked if we
                            were getting low on helicopters and whether we were increasing our
                            orders. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said
                            we had built up our helicopters enormously. The loss rate was only one
                            in 10,000 sorties and helicopters did not wear out. Up to now there was
                            no basis for concern about numbers of helicopters. Nevertheless we were
                            increasing production.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_HBB1">Hickenlooper</persName> said that
                            alternatives one, two and three were out. That anything short of a
                            result that would make a reliable buffer against Communism would be
                            disastrous. A negotiated so-called peace that did not do this would
                            merely compound the felony. He did not know just which way it should be
                            done—and he remarked that over the years mistakes had been made. He
                            differentiated between approval and support. He thought his decision now
                            would be to support it but not approve it. The President remarked that
                            he was in the same position as Senator <persName corresp="#p_HBB1">Hickenlooper</persName>. He had supported the decisions of 1954
                            without approving them. Now there were 80,000 to 90,000 men out there
                            asking for help and his answer was yes.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_KTH1">Kuchel</persName> asked what
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>'s orders were.
                            Must he clean up all the red spots? The notes do not show what answer he
                            got.</p>
                        <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boggs</persName> said that
                            alternative five was the logical way out. The President said that his
                            object was to get the government together, to get the Allies together
                            and to get the country together. And he would make his decision
                            tomorrow. He spelled out three phases in the future and thought that by
                            1 November we would double our forces.</p>
                        <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_ALC1">Arends</persName> asked Secretary
                            Rusk if the Allies could help us on limiting shipping to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. Secretary Rusk answered about help in
                            South Vietnam from Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. <persName corresp="#p_ALC1">Arends</persName> persisted on shipping. The
                            Secretary of State said that there had been some improvement and that
                            through various devices we could get a cutback in shipments to Hanoi
                            which might make us feel better but would not really change the
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_HBB1">Hickenlooper</persName> said that we
                            were treating symptoms; there was a great danger of a negotiated
                            stalemate, and we needed a reliable settlement. The President said that
                            Senator <persName corresp="#p_HBB1">Hickenlooper</persName> should talk
                            to <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0301"/>Mike Mansfield and Bill
                            Fulbright and see what the three could agree on. Right now settlement
                            was not a practicable problem, because the Communists thought they were
                            winning. The question of settlement was a good long way away. Senator
                                <persName corresp="#p_HBB1">Hickenlooper</persName> said the big
                            question was what we were going to do. The President said that we are
                            going to try to bring about a situation where the government of South
                            Vietnam will be able to defend itself against foreign ideology.
                                “<persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> wants help—I'm
                            going to give it—the question is how.”</p>
                        <p>The Speaker closed the meeting by saying that the President would have
                            united support. This was a historic meeting. The President would have
                            the support of all true Americans.</p>
                        <p>After the meeting with the Leadership, the President held a small meeting
                            in his office. Present were the President—the two Secretaries, Goodwin,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Moyers</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BH3">Busby</persName>, and Bundy. The President remarked
                            that we were prolonging the agony for 90 days and that he wanted a
                            statement of 700 words, the essence of which would be that he was giving
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> what he needed.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> repeated the
                            thirteen battalion, 50,000 men figure, and expressed his confidence on
                            the handling of the matter.</p>

                                July 25, conveyed instructions to deliver on Monday, July 26, a
                                personal letter from President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> to the head of government outlining the

                                struggle in Vietnam. The telegrams were sent to Brussels, Ottawa,
                                Copenhagen, Bonn, Tehran, Dublin, Rome, The Hague, Madrid, Tel Aviv,

                            for political reasons or because their contributions have in fact been
                            insignificant.</p>
                        <p>To date, we have received reports from 23 Embassies, which have presented
                            the Presidential message on Vietnam to the heads of government or
                            highest government official of the host country. These reports show
                            sympathy of our principles of action—resistance to aggression while
                            working for peace—but yield little tangible evidence of prospects of
                            substantially increased assistance.</p>
                        <p>Some countries—notably Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, and the
                            Philippines—express a willingness to consider an additional effort
                            urgently, but our Ambassador in Ottawa cautions against over optimism
                            while our Ambassador in Manila advises against encouraging the
                            Philippines to diffuse its effort.</p>
                        <p>In several cases no comment was offered by the foreign government at the
                            time of receipt of the message but comment may be forthcoming later.

                        <p>I opened the meeting by reporting fully on the Leadership discussion of
                            Viet Nam this morning. There was a general sense of reassurance that
                            your objective was not to get in deeply and that you intended to do only
                            what was essential in the military line until January, while Rusk and
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> were concentrating
                            on attempting to get us out. A general desire to support you in this
                            course was expressed. It was felt that one of the best ways this could
                            be done would be by communicating the feelings of some of the senior
                            Members of the Senate to you in this fashion.</p>
                        <p>Among the major points which were raised by various of the Senators in
                            attendance during the discussions were the following:</p>
                        <p>1. The estimate of 100,000 men by the end of the year was probably short,
                            that the more likely figure would be 150,000.</p>
                        <p>2. The Russians feel that they have an obligation to aid the North
                            Vietnamese not unlike ours towards a Western European country which
                            might be attacked and if we expect them to help in getting negotiations
                            started before this situation gets out of hand we have to provide them
                            with some basis for helping.</p>
                        <p>3. The United Nations may be an important link in a way out of the
                            situation but this possibility is clouded by the issue of Article 19; it
                            may not be opportune to insist upon enforcement of the Article at this
                            time; but heat is already being generated on the issue in the House and
                            some prompt Presidential initiative on the point in public may be
                            desirable.</p>
                        <p>4. Bridges to Eastern Europe need to be kept open and continued
                            encouragement of the evolution of these nations (Yugoslavia, in
                            particular) towards full independence, political and economic, under
                            their own unique forms of organization is of the greatest
                            importance.</p>
                        <p>5. The Russians are deeply concerned that we are abandoning the policy of
                            peaceful co-existence; some tangible reassurance that we are not,
                            perhaps through the consular convention, is desirable.</p>
                        <p>6. The country is backing the President on Viet Nam primarily because he
                            is President, not necessarily out of any understanding or sympathy with
                            policies on Viet Nam; beneath the support, there is deep concern and a
                            great deal of confusion which could explode at any time; in addition
                            racial factors at home could become involved.</p>
                        <p>7. The main perplexity in the Vietnamese situation is that even if you
                            win, totally, you still do not come out well. What have you achieved? It
                            is by no means a “vital” area of U.S. concern as it was described by
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> at a hearing this
                            morning.</p>
                        <p>8. There is reason for concern and irritation at <persName corresp="#p_NCKAVM1">Cao Ky</persName>'s statement that we should
                            fight on the perimeter while the Vietnamese military is organizing the
                            rear.</p>
                        <p>9. The President was ill-advised to begin the bombing of North Viet Nam
                            in the first place and the error was then compounded by the limited
                            character of the bombing.</p>
                        <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0304"/>
                        <p>10. In clarification of what would follow a failure of the <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>-Rusk effort between now and
                            January, it was pointed out that it would mean that we would probably
                            have to add very substantially to manpower at that time.</p>
                        <p>11. The military concept of a greatly extended bombing in Viet Nam is
                            sound.</p>
                        <p>12. Another cessation of bombing of longer duration than the previous one
                            might be desirable as a means of getting discussions underway.</p>
                        <p>13. Underground contact might be sought not only with the Russians but
                            with the Chinese as well; it could be particularly useful in bringing
                            about talks in the event another pause in the bombing is attempted.</p>
                        <p>14. France, who has the best contacts in Indochina, has been virtually
                            ignored as a possible avenue of approach to negotiations.</p>
                        <p>15. The situation at Pleiku is highly dangerous; if the U.S. garrison is
                            attacked it could be another Dien Bien Phu and it could mean increased
                            pressure for our deeper involvement.</p>
                        <p>16. The French parliament, at no time, permitted conscripts to be used in
                            Indochina.</p>
                        <p>17. The Viet Cong are highly skilled and formidable fighters; the South
                            Vietnamese forces are of dubious quality and larger and larger
                            desertions can be anticipated.</p>
                        <p>18. The important thing in a situation like this which is clearly
                            detrimental to us is to concentrate on finding a way out; a possibility
                            might exist in a combination of the coastal enclave strategy, a
                            cessation of aerial bombardment and the use of all possible contacts to
                            get negotiations underway.</p>
                        <p>19. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> has been a
                            disappointment in his handling of this situation, probably because he is
                            being used in a way in which he ought not to be used.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted that there was obviously not a unanimity among the
                            Members present on all of the points listed. But there was a very
                            substantial agreement on many of them. Moreover, there was full
                            agreement that insofar as Viet Nam is concerned we are deeply enmeshed
                            in a place where we ought not to be; that the situation is rapidly going
                            out of control; and that every effort should be made to extricate
                                ourselves.<note n="2" xml:id="d96fn2">At the President's request,

                        <p>On July 28, 1965, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> opened a mid-day press conference at the White
                            House with a statement in which he explained that U.S. involvement in
                            the conflict in Vietnam would be expanded. He stated that the United
                            States intended “to convince the Communists that we cannot be defeated
                            by force of arms or by superior power.” He said that General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> had outlined the forces
                            needed to meet the “mounting aggression” in South Vietnam, and he added:
                            “We will meet his needs.” He had therefore ordered U.S. forces in
                            Vietnam increased from 75,000 to 125,000, and he noted that additional
                            forces would be dispatched as they were requested. To meet the necessary
                            increase in active forces, the draft call would be raised over a period
                            of time from 17,000 to 35,000 per month. The President reiterated that
                            the United States was ready at any time for unconditional discussions to
                            move the conflict from the battlefield to the conference table. The

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ADU1">Duntov</persName> was interested in
                            ascertaining the North Vietnamese attitudes and position because of the
                            effect the Vietnamese situation has on Dreyfus' investments, and through
                            M. Parisot, Foreign Editor of “France Soir,” arranged to see Nguyen Van
                            Chi in Paris in early May. Dissatisfied with the lack of substance in
                            this contact, however, he asked M. Parisot to get him an interview with
                                <persName corresp="#p_MVBR1">Mai Van Bo</persName>. This interview
                            was arranged with little less than a week's notice.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ADU1">Duntov</persName> stated that he had had

                                Bo</persName> in Paris on the evening of July 16, 1965. Also present

                            confidential, but he assented when Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ADU1">Duntov</persName> asked if he might pass the substance of the
                            conversation to friends in Washington.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_ADU1">Duntov</persName> gave <persName corresp="#p_MVBR1">Mai Van Bo</persName> an explanation of the

                            economic developments.</p>
                        <p>Conversation almost immediately focused on the Viet-Nam situation. The
                            following points were raised and discussed:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Hanoi's Attitude toward Negotiations</hi>. <persName corresp="#p_ADU1">Duntov</persName> asked why Hanoi would not
                            negotiate. Bo responded that Hanoi did want to negotiate, <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0307"/>and that there were ample contacts in
                            which negotiations might take place. However, there must first be a
                            basis for negotiations. Bo first said that the proper basis would be the
                            Geneva Accords of 1954. He then added that these accords are often
                            misinterpreted and misquoted, and that the true interpretation is found
                            in the Four Points laid out by Pham Van Dong. Thus these formed the
                            proper basis for negotiations.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Unification of Viet-Nam</hi>. Bo stressed very
                            strongly that Viet-Nam is one country and cannot be divided. When asked
                            whether the US had not made clear its willingness to negotiate
                            unconditionally, Bo replied that the President's Baltimore speech of
                            April 7 was a trap, and that the President was really laying down
                            conditions by his insistence on the necessity of an independent South
                            Viet-Nam and guarantees for such a South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>One of the participants asked Bo whether his position was not in conflict
                            with statements by the National Liberation Front to the effect that the
                            Front favored an independent South Viet-Nam. Bo seemed somewhat taken
                            aback by this question, but recovered and said that this would be all
                            right, since an “independent” government in South Viet-Nam would in fact
                            decide to join the north.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Internal Solution in South Viet-Nam</hi>. Bo
                            insisted, somewhat emotionally, that there was one basic premise,
                            self-determination by the South Vietnamese people, and that if this was
                            accepted, a solution was possible. He referred at different times to the
                            phrase, “self-determination,” and to the Liberation Front program for
                            the South (insistence on which, of course, is the third of Pham Van
                            Dong's Four Points). In referring to “self-determination,” Bo explained
                            that, if this principle was recognized, an independent government could
                            be formed. However, he went on to say that no “traitor” could be
                            included, apparently meaning by this that at least the present South
                            Vietnamese military leaders would be excluded.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Withdrawal of US Forces</hi>. Bo was asked what time
                            schedule would be required—in the event of an agreement for an
                            independent South Viet-Nam—on the withdrawal of US forces. Bo replied
                            that this was no problem and that it was a technical detail that could
                            be worked out as it had been with the French in 1954. The withdrawal
                            could be discussed and could take place over a two- or three-year
                            period. Bo related US withdrawal clearly, however, to acceptance of the
                            principles he had laid down for “independence” and “self-determination”
                            in South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Cease-fire or Cessation in Bombings</hi>. Bo
                            mentioned the bombings of the North only in passing and with mild
                            reproof. He gave no indication that a cessation of bombing was required
                            before there could be discussions.</p>
                        <pb n="276" xml:id="pg_276" facs="0308"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comment</p>
                        <p>1. The position taken by Bo in this conversation appears to be consistent
                            with the latest statements from Hanoi, notably an article on July
                                16.<note n="2" xml:id="d98fn2">Reference is apparently to the “White
                                Paper” on “US Aggression and Intervention in Vietnam” released by
                                North Vietnam in English on July 16. For text, see <hi rend="italic">United States-Vietnam Relations, 1945-1967,</hi> Book 12, Part
                                VI, B, 2, pp. 146-151.</note> Bo appeared to be quite firm that
                            there must be an agreed basis for discussions, and that this must be the
                            Four Points. Although he persisted in using the phrase
                            “self-determination” to describe the solution within South Viet-Nam, his
                            parallel references to the Liberation Front program seemed to state that
                            Hanoi would still insist that we accept in advance the principle that
                            the Liberation Front be admitted to a coalition government (the core of
                            the Front “program”). His reference to the exclusion of “traitors” also
                            seems to point to a government that would be weighted in favor of the
                            Liberation Front.</p>
                        <p>2. In clearly not insisting on prior withdrawal of US forces before any
                            discussions, and in avoiding mention of a cessation of bombings as a
                            pre-condition, Bo was also consistent with the Hanoi July 16
                            statement.</p>
                        <p>3. Bo's great stress on the necessity for a unified Viet-Nam, and his
                            failure to note the US reference to this subject in Secretary Rusk's
                            speech of June 23,<note n="3" xml:id="d98fn3">In an address to the
                                American Foreign Service Association, Rusk called for a “free
                                decision by the peoples of North and South Vietnam on the matter of
                                reunification.” For text, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, July 12, 1965, pp. 52-55.</note> suggest that as
                            of the date of the conversation Hanoi was not yet clear what the US
                            position was on reunification. The President's July 28 statement,<note n="4" xml:id="d98fn4">See <ref target="#d97">Document
                                97</ref>.</note> referring specifically to the possibility of “free
                            elections … throughout Viet-Nam under international supervision,” should
                            make clear to Hanoi what our position is on this point. However, it is
                            clear that Hanoi, in the wording of the Four Points and in Bo's stress
                            on Viet-Nam being one nation, wishes an agreement that would effectively
                            assume early reunification, and presumably without any holding of
                            elections in the two Viet-Nams to see if the people wanted it. In other
                            words, there remains a difference of substance between us on this point,
                            but it seems doubtful that the US position could now be misunderstood in
                                Hanoi.<note n="5" xml:id="d98fn5">In a July 30 memorandum to

                                that <persName corresp="#p_MVBR1">Mai Van Bo</persName> appeared to
                                be confused about the U.S. position on the Geneva Accords,
                                unification, and self-determination. He suggested that “we clarify
                                these points to <persName corresp="#p_MVBR1">Mai</persName>, and in

                                Dean added that he felt that such a direct approach was necessary to
                                get a firm reading of Hanoi's position. He felt that the danger of
                                public disclosure of such an approach by a U.S. businessman was
                                slight, in that <persName corresp="#p_MVBR1">Mai Van Bo</persName>

                            have a security investigation, and we would also have to take account,

                            to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> mtg though less categorically.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TU1">Thant</persName> mentioned that <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> had sounded him out in Geneva
                            in early July on this same point<note n="6" xml:id="d99fn6">See <ref target="#d52fn7">footnote 7, Document 52</ref>.</note> and he
                            had replied that he would explore possibility but was not hopeful.
                            Subsequently in Paris he had sounded out <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName>, who had been negative because he did not think
                            Peking, Hanoi or Saigon would be willing to attend <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> mtg. <persName corresp="#p_TU1">Thant</persName> also mentioned that Ben Bella, during their
                            exchange concerning <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>'s attendance at
                            Afro-Asian mtg, had argued Hanoi would not agree to any <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> involvement in Vietnam question because
                            of absence from <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s. <persName corresp="#p_TU1">Thant</persName> himself fears that in any <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> mtg Sovs would have to take strong line against <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> involvement and to veto any res. He is
                            doubtful, therefore, as he told Secy at their mtg July 19, that there is
                            any advantage in pursuing idea of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> mtg
                            with Sovs and French.<note n="7" xml:id="d99fn7"> Rusk and <persName corresp="#p_TU1">Thant</persName> met at 4:30 p.m. on July 19 at

                        <p>As to <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> himself issuing some sort of
                            appeal, <persName corresp="#p_TU1">Thant</persName> mentioned that he
                            had some time ago been asked by Washington to delay cease-fire appeal
                            and had done so. <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>
                            expressed appreciation for his having delayed such an appeal and pointed
                            out problem that would be created for us by unpoliced cease-fire.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TU1">Thant</persName> suggested that
                            desirability and character of appeal by him should be more fully
                            explored next time he and <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> meet.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> expressed disagreement with
                            indication in <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> report
                            that Hanoi is moving away from Peking. It has been his impression that
                            they are drawing closer to Peking, certainly closer than they were last
                            autumn when Hanoi through Moscow, without clearing with Peking, agreed
                            to meet with us.</p>
                        <p>As to membership North <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> and South <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_TU1">Thant</persName> posed certain questions.
                            Would Hanoi apply for membership? If it did, would <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0311"/>Nationalist China veto admission? It is
                                <persName corresp="#p_TU1">Thant</persName>'s belief that Peking
                            would oppose <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> membership and would
                            tell Hanoi not to apply. However, <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
                            welcomed US “green light” on this point and said he would explore
                            possibilities.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> then made several comments on
                            possible Geneva conf. He said it is matter of indifference to him
                            whether conf precedes or follows cease-fire. In former case he concurred
                            that cease-fire should be first item on agenda. However, it is essential
                            that Peking should participate and, while he has had no contact with
                            Peking since becoming <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>, he sees two
                            possible impediments to their participation.</p>
                        <p>First impediment would be problem of South Vietnamese representation.
                            Peking would claim only Viet Cong should represent <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. This of course is unrealistic and
                            unacceptable. However, in <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>'s view, it
                            would also be unrealistic that only Saigon should represent <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. Government of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> changes from month to month and it would not be
                            realistic to claim that <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName>, or whoever will be
                            in their place at time conf convenes, are competent to represent <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss> Vietnamese people. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> recommends that <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> be
                            represented at such conf by two delegations, Saigon and Viet Cong,
                            having equal status. He mentioned incidentally that Hanoi would
                            certainly reject Viet Cong appearing only as part of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> deleg. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said he had sounded out both <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France concerning his suggested dual <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> deleg, but both had said they preferred
                            to await US reaction before commenting.</p>
                        <p>Second possible impediment to Peking participation in Geneva conf is fact
                            that Peking has insisted publicly, though not recently, that 1954 Geneva
                            Accords must be reaffirmed and implemented by any new conf. Such
                            implementation would of course include withdrawal foreign forces and
                            bases, as well as elections. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> noted
                            however that Hanoi has apparently not insisted on withdrawal US forces
                            before new conf.</p>
                        <p>This subject was closed with agreement that <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> would consider suggestions we had presented and would
                            explore them with Sovs and others where he considered appropriate and
                            that conversations would be resumed upon <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>'s return to NY.<note n="8" xml:id="d99fn8">
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> also gave U Thant a
                                personal letter from President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, dated July 28, at this meeting. In the
                                letter, Johnson indicated that he had instructed <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> to maintain contact with
                                    <persName corresp="#p_TU1">Thant</persName> on developments in
                                Vietnam, and he welcomed <persName corresp="#p_TU1">Thant</persName>'s efforts to move the conflict to the conference
                                table. <persName corresp="#p_TU1">Thant</persName> responded on July
                                29 in a letter to Johnson in which he expressed his determination to
                                pursue a negotiated settlement of the Vietnam conflict with all the
                                means at his disposal. On July 30, <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> sent a letter to the President of the
                                Security Council in which he stated that the United States was
                                prepared to work unconditionally with the members of the Security
                                Council in search for an acceptable formula to restore peace and
                                security to Southeast Asia. All three letters are printed in <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents,

                        </list>
                        <p>Summarized below, as you requested, is an evaluation of the program of
                            bombing North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Rationale for bombing the North</hi>. The program of
                            bombing <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> began in an atmosphere of
                            reprisal. We had had the August Tonkin Gulf episode; we had absorbed the
                            November 1 attack on Bien Hoa Airfield and the Christmas Eve bombing of
                            the Brinks Hotel in Saigon. The attacks at U.S. installations at Pleiku
                            on February 7 and Qui Nhon on February 10 were the immediate causes of
                            the first strikes against North Vietnam. The strike following Pleiku was
                            announced as a “response”—a “reprisal”; our strike following Qui Nhon
                            was called a response to more generalized <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> terrorism. The major purposes of the bombing program,
                            however, were:</p>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">To promote a settlement</hi>. The program was
                            designed (1) to influence the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to
                            negotiate (explicitly or otherwise), and (2) to provide us with a
                            bargaining counter within negotiations.</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">To interdict infiltration</hi>. The program was
                            calculated to reduce the flow of men and supplies from the North to the
                            South—at least, to put a ceiling on the size of war that the enemy could
                            wage in the South.</p>
                        <p>Supplemental purposes of the program were (c) to demonstrate to South
                            Vietnam, North Vietnam and the world the U.S. commitment to see this
                            thing through, (d) to raise morale in South Vietnam by punishing North
                            Vietnam, the source of the suffering in the South, and (e) to reduce
                            criticism of the Administration from advocates of a bombing program.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Achievement of major purposes.</hi> The potential
                            targets, targets struck and per cent of destruction are shown at Tab A.
                            In terms of the purposes of the program, its results have been as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">To promote a settlement.</hi> Obviously, this
                            objective has not yet been attained. We recognized at the start of the
                            program, as we do now, that the influence of the bombing on a settlement
                            would not be great until the North Vietnamese had been disappointed in
                            their hopes for a quick military success in the South. There is no doubt
                            that the bombing program has become an important counter in the current
                            tacit and explicit bargaining <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0313"/>process and will be an important counter in any future bargaining.</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">To interdict infiltration.</hi> It is believed that
                            regular North Vietnamese units now in South Vietnam (estimated to be one
                            division) require about 4 tons of supplies daily for the “current” level
                            of combat but would require 67 tons of supplies daily for “light”
                            combat. (“Current” levels are operations conducted largely in small
                            units; “light” combat would involve larger elements in action on the
                            average of every third day, with expenditures of one-third of each
                            unit's basic load of ammunition on each action.) It is believed that
                            regular North Vietnamese units and Pathet Lao forces in the Laos
                            Panhandle require about 21 and 51 tons daily respectively for the two
                            levels of combat. Viet Cong arms, ammunition and other supply
                            requirements are estimated at 8 tons daily for “current” combat and 115
                            tons for “light” combat. The effect of the interdiction program on the
                            movement of supplies is summarized below:</p>
                        <p>The 440-ton per day rail traffic from Hanoi south to Vinh has been cut
                            off at Ninh Binh (40 miles south of Hanoi). Supplies still move by sea
                            and over the parallel highway system. The latter has been badly damaged
                            and is subject to armed reconnaissance; sea traffic into <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> is under surveillance. At a minimum,
                            supply is slower and less regular and delivered at increased cost in
                            resources and energy expended. Roads into Laos have been subjected to
                            similar interdiction and armed recce. Only limited interdiction has been
                            imposed on the key rail and road net northwest of Hanoi, and none on the
                            railway net northeast of Hanoi; and port destruction has been minimal.
                            Thus, substantially uninterrupted supply continues from China by rail
                            into Hanoi and by sea into Haiphong to meet major North Vietnamese
                            military, industrial and civilian needs.</p>
                        <p>The effect of the bombing on military operations is estimated to have
                            been as follows:</p>

                                forces</hi>. The interdiction program has caused North Vietnam
                            increasing difficulty in supplying their units in Laos and South
                            Vietnam. How severe this difficulty is or how stretched North Vietnam's
                            supply capabilities are cannot be estimated precisely. Our interdiction
                            efforts may have either prevented or deterred the North from sending
                            more troops than they already have. The interdiction programs in North
                            Vietnam and Laos also may have influenced a Communist decision to forego
                            a 1965 offensive in Laos.</p>
                        <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">For Viet Cong forces</hi>. Because the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> require significantly less infiltrated
                            arms and ammunition and other supplies than do the North Vietnamese and
                            Pathet Lao forces, the interdiction program probably has had less of an
                            adverse effect on their operations. By raising <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> fears concerning adequacy of supplies, however, the
                            program may have caused the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> summer
                            offensive to be less intense, aggressive and unrelenting <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0314"/>than it would otherwise have been. It
                            should be noted that the program has not been a “strategic” bombing
                            program; it has been limited to selected targets of fairly direct
                            military relevance. Populations and targets such as dikes and basic
                            industries have not been struck. Furthermore, the immediate vicinities
                            of Hanoi and Haiphong have been avoided, partly because the targets
                            there are primarily of the “strategic” type and partly because strikes
                            there would involve even more serious risks of confrontations with the
                            Soviet Union and China.</p>

                            Vietnam was raised by the initiation of the bombing program (as, later,
                            by the deployment of additional troops). Now—with the bombing programs
                            having become commonplace and with the failure of the situation to
                            improve—morale in South Vietnam is not discernibly better than it was
                            before the bombing program began. In a sense, South Vietnam is now
                            “addicted” to the program; a permanent abandonment of the program would
                            have a distinct depressing effect on morale in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>c. <hi rend="italic">Reduction of criticism of the Administration</hi>.
                            Some critics, who advocated bombing, were silenced; others are now as
                            vocal or more vocal because the program has been too limited for their
                            taste. The program has generated a new school of criticism among
                            liberals and “peace” groups, whose activities have been reflected
                            especially in teach-ins and newspaper criticisms.</p>
                        <p>d. <hi rend="italic">Damage to peaceful image of the US </hi>. The price
                            paid for improving our image as a guarantor has been damage to our image
                            as a country which eschews armed attacks on other nations. The hue and
                            cry correlates with the kind of weapons (e.g., bombs vs. napalm), the
                            kind of targets (e.g., bridges vs. people), the location of targets
                            (e.g., south vs. north), and not least the extent to which the critic
                            feels threatened by Asian communism (e.g., Thailand vs. the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>). Furthermore, for a given level of
                            bombing, the hue and cry is less now than it was earlier, perhaps to
                            some extent helped by Communist intransigence toward discussions. The
                            objection to our “warlike” image and the approval of our fulfilling our
                            commitments competes in the minds of many nations (and individuals) in
                            the world, producing a schizophrenia. Within such allied countries as
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Japan, popular antagonism to
                            the bombings per se, fear of escalation and belief that the bombings are
                            the main obstacle to negotiation, have created political problems for

                            program—because it appears to reject the policy of “peaceful
                            co-existence,” because it involves an attack on a “fellow socialist
                            country,” because the Soviet people have vivid horrible memories of air
                            bombing, because it challenges the USSR as she competes with China for
                            leadership of the Communist world, and because US and Soviet arms are
                            now striking each other in North Vietnam—has strained the US-Soviet
                            detente, making constructive arms-control and other cooperative programs
                            more difficult. How serious this effect will be and whether the detente
                            can be revived depend on how far we carry our military actions against
                            the North and how long the campaign continues. At the same time, the
                            bombing program offers the Soviet Union an opportunity to play a role in
                            bringing peace to Vietnam, by gaining credit for persuading us to
                            terminate the program. There is a chance that the scenario could spin
                            out this way; if so, the effect of the entire experience on the
                            US-Soviet detente could be a net plus.</p>

                            politically easier for North Vietnam to accept negotiations and/or to
                            make concessions at a time when bombing of their territory is not

                            Interdiction should be carried out so as to maximize effectiveness and

                            Physically, it makes no difference whether a rifle is interdicted on its
                            way into North Vietnam, on its way out of North Vietnam, in Laos or in
                            South Vietnam. But different amounts of effort and different political
                            prices may be paid depending on how and where it is done. The critical
                            variables in this regard are (1) the type of targets struck (e.g., port
                            facilities involving civilian casualties <pb n="284" xml:id="pg_284" facs="0316"/>vs. isolated bridges), (2) type of aircraft (e.g.,
                            B-52s vs. F-105s), (3) kind of weapons (e.g., napalm vs. ordinary
                            bombs), (4) location of target (e.g., in Hanoi vs. Laotian border area),
                            and (5) the accompanying declaratory policy (e.g., unlimited vs. a
                            defined interdiction zone).</p>

                        <p>The implications of the Vietnam situation for the economy appear to be
                            these:</p>
                        <p>It has affected, and may continue to influence, speculative commodity and
                            financial markets.</p>
                        <p>There are not likely to be significant effects on over-all prices,
                            output, or employment in the next few months.</p>
                        <p>If expenditures follow the path that Bob McNamara now visualizes as
                            likely, they could provide a significant stimulus to economic activity
                            during the first half of next year.</p>
                        <p>We will need to intensify our concern about prices and wages.</p>
                        <p>Budgetary and tax planning for fiscal 1967 will be affected.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Analysis</p>
                        <p>1. Our economy has lots of room to absorb a defense step-up.</p>
                        <p>There is still a $15-$20 billion margin of idle industrial capacity and
                            excessive unemployment.</p>
                        <p>Our productive capacity is growing by $25-$30 billion a year (apart from
                            any price increases), making room for both more butter and, if needed,
                            more guns.</p>
                        <p>Apart from the defense effort, market demand would not be likely to grow
                            as fast as productive capacity during the course of FY 1966, and
                            unemployment would probably be creeping up.</p>
                        <p>2. The stock market is anxious about Vietnam news, because the financial
                            community</p>
                        <p>—generally hates uncertainties which could cloud the business outlook;
                            and</p>
                        <p>—specifically fears that a major escalation could bring on increased
                            taxes and wage and price controls.</p>
                        <p>3. Vietnam news has had an important influence on the stock market.</p>
                        <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0319"/>
                        <p>A 12 point drop in the Dow-Jones Index on July 20 is generally attributed
                            to the Administration's appraisal of the war as “deteriorating.”</p>
                        <p>Since your statement Wednesday noon,<note n="2" xml:id="d101fn2">July 28.
                                Reference is to the President's statement at his news conference;
                                see <ref target="#d97">Document 97</ref>.</note> the market has been
                            strong, with a gain of 14 points to today's close. On learning that no
                            drastic measures were planned, “Wall Street heaved a sigh of relief,”
                            said the Times.</p>
                        <p>4. As the stock market rebounded on reassuring Vietnam news, speculative
                            commodity markets retreated.</p>
                        <p>On Wednesday, copper futures fell sharply. In the previous 2 weeks, they
                            had risen more than 10%.</p>
                        <p>Fortunately, many other commodity markets had topped out before the
                            latest round of Vietnam news, and prices were not poised to leap
                            ahead.</p>
                        <p>5. These markets will continue to reflect the ups-and-downs of military
                            action and speculation. But there is no good reason for major flurries
                            in the near future. Nobody can seriously expect that the kind of program
                            you outlined is going to overheat the economy, strain industrial
                            capacity, or generate a consumer buying boom. But speculative excitement
                            inflames easily in the commodity markets, and we should be careful what
                            we say and do.</p>
                        <p>6. The thought of direct controls on prices and wages is what frightens
                            business most. The worry on this score is way out of proportion to the
                            facts.</p>
                        <p>Here are two examples on opposite sides in recent press comment. U.S.
                            News reported—before your press conference—“If the Vietnam war continues
                            to escalate … rising toward the scale of the Korean war, wage and price
                            controls will return, many materials will be allocated, and an excess
                            profits tax will again become a real possibility.” But a knowledgeable
                            broker argued in the Times, “Even if we assume the Vietnam war gets as
                            big as the Korean war, this doesn't mean we would have to have excess
                            profits taxes or commodity controls as we had then.” Your Wednesday
                            press conference should have been reassuring.</p>
                        <p>We can say—and perhaps should emphasize publicly—that direct controls are
                            simply not live possibilities.</p>
                        <p>Only in the remote event that the Defense step-up for the near future got
                            into the $10 billion range would we have to give serious thought to
                            higher taxes, selective commodity allocations, or (last of all) to
                            direct controls on wages and prices.</p>
                        <p>7. The analogy with Korea simply does not hold water.</p>
                        <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0320"/>
                        <p>We started the Korean war with defense purchases running at a $12 billion
                            rate; we doubled them in 9 months and tripled them in 15. Our defense
                            capability is incomparably greater today.</p>
                        <p>Even so, the real reason for the surge in prices in late 1950 and early
                            1951 was not the pressure of defense orders or outlays. Many businesses
                            made frantic efforts to pile up inventories, and consumers went on a
                            buying spree. Consumer spending jumped 7-1/2% in the third quarter of
                            1950 and took another 5-1/2% jump in the first quarter of 1951;
                            consumers virtually stopped saving. Fresh memories of wartime rationing
                            and shortages drove households into a hoarding binge. The consumer has
                            been living in a world of plentiful supplies and well-stocked shelves
                            for a dozen years now. He is not about to panic.</p>
                        <p>8. The current thinking in <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>, as
                            relayed to me by Bob McNamara on a super-confidential basis, points to a
                            gradual and moderate build-up of expenditures and manpower.</p>
                        <p>In the closing months of 1965, when the reduction of steel inventories
                            will be holding down our economic advance, the defense step-up will be
                            small and any influence it has will be in the right direction.</p>
                        <p>In the first half of 1966, the impact on output and employment will be
                            more significant. But it means extra insurance against slowdown or
                            recession during the period (when payroll taxes will jump)—not a threat
                            of overheating.</p>
                        <p>9. We are certainly not saying that a Vietnam crisis is just what the
                            doctor ordered for the American economy in the next 12 months. But, on a
                            coldly objective analysis, the over-all effects are most likely to be
                            favorable to our prosperity.</p>
                        <p>10. We were probably heading into a period of a slightly faster creep of
                            wages and industrial prices without Vietnam. The new uncertainties will
                            probably strengthen that tendency.</p>
                        <p>This underscores the importance of Government-wide emphasis on the
                            guideposts.</p>
                        <p>It also means we should go slow on measures that will raise business
                            costs—like higher minimum wages.</p>
                        <p>And we may need to have larger stockpile releases, if commodity markets
                            start to misbehave.</p>
                        <p>11. Vietnam will pose fiscal problems in our budget planning for FY
                            1967.</p>
                        <p>Added defense outlays will take a chunk of the $7 billion normal
                            year-to-year growth of tax revenues that we have to use in order to
                            avoid a fiscal drag. The bigger the defense chunk has to be, the less
                            room for domestic civilian programs or tax cuts.</p>
                        <p>The uncertainties about defense needs, private demand, and Federal
                            civilian programs prevent any conclusions as yet. It is now less likely
                            that <pb n="289" xml:id="pg_289" facs="0321"/>you will want to recommend
                            a tax cut next year. But it remains a possibility that shouldn't be
                            ruled out.</p>

                        <p>On August 1, 1965, Yugoslav President <persName corresp="#p_TM2">Tito</persName> and Indian Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SLB1">Shastri</persName> issued a joint communique
                            calling for a suspension of U.S. bombing of North Vietnam, while a
                            conference of interested parties attempted to resolve the Vietnam
                            conflict on the basis of the 1954 Geneva Agreements. (<hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>, August 2, 1965) Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> had met with President
                                <persName corresp="#p_TM2">Tito</persName> at his summer retreat on
                            the island of Vanga on July 31 and discussed this proposal. <persName corresp="#p_TM2">Tito</persName> indicated that he believed that
                            North Vietnam was prepared to negotiate, and added that he and <persName corresp="#p_SLB1">Shastri</persName> would be consulting with other
                            non-aligned countries concerning the initiative. <persName corresp="#p_TM2">Tito</persName> felt that with a return to the 1954
                            Geneva Agreements, South Vietnam could emerge as an independent,
                            democratic republic which would serve as a buffer against Chinese
                            expansion in the area. (Telegram 479 from London, August 1; Johnson

                            ideas of which, I believe, you should be aware:</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">“'Politico'.</hi> Your paper states sound conclusions
                            when it speaks of the need for an affirmative answer to the threat of
                            Communist-Subversion/Terrorism”, the need for good practical politics in
                            Vietnam, the fact that our other programs even though excellent are no
                            substitute for a real political program, and the need for underscoring
                            the truth of promises through actual performance. Personally, I don't
                            see how the Communists can be defeated without these positive steps. The
                            military can suppress the Communist forces, even keep them suppressed by
                            continued military action, but cannot defeat them short of genocide
                            unless our side puts the war on a political footing in Viet Nam.</p>
                        <p>“The enemy in Vietnam understands thoroughly the political nature of the
                            war he is waging. The enemy sees his every act as a political act, and
                            uses psychological, military, and socio-economic weapons to gain his
                            political goals. This is a strict rule the enemy borrowed from
                            Clausewitz. Lenin, Mao, <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho</persName>, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_Giap1">Giap</persName> have been clear and
                            firm on this basic rule. The Viet Cong have obeyed it amazingly well.
                            Our side has broken this rule over and over again. It is being broken
                            daily right now.</p>
                        <p>“Thus, when you ask my help to get a Counter-Subversion/Terrorism program
                            moving, you really are asking me to help you to get our side to start
                            obeying and applying the prime rule of the war in Vietnam. It isn't
                            separate from the other programs. It is the basis upon which the war in
                            Vietnam will be won or lost. The psychological, military, and
                            socio-economic programs are its instruments, not ends in themselves.
                            Political bankruptcy in Vietnam and the direct use of U.S. combat forces
                            complicate your task vastly. (A U.S. commander, tasked to attack a
                            suspected enemy position, is going to clobber it first by bombing or
                            artillery to cut his own U.S. casualties to a minimum when they attack;
                            casualties of Vietnamese non-combatants must be secondary to his
                            responsibility to his own command and mission.) I point this out to
                            underscore the fact that something brand new, perhaps of considerable
                            difference from anything previous, will have to be worked out in Vietnam
                            to put the war on the essential political footing. It might require
                            heroic measures, such as moving non-combatants out of Central Vietnam
                            into the far South, to permit the military threat to be resolved
                            conclusively in Central Vietnam by military means while non-combatant
                            refugees get a real chance at a new life. Again, this could be a wrong
                            move. You are going to need some exceptionally expert help to solve this
                            vital problem; for many reasons, it's your biggest.”</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. I met with General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                            for an hour and a half in his office at Gettysburg this morning. I had
                            arranged the visit with him previously by phone for the purpose of
                            bringing him up-to-date on the situation and program actions relating to
                            South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>2. Before I began my remarks he expressed concern over one important
                            aspect of recent actions. Citing Clausewitz, he pointed out that to
                            every action we take, we must expect the enemy to take counter-action.
                            It is important to avoid acting by “driblets.” If we want to win, we
                            should not base our action on minimum needs, but should swamp the enemy
                            with overwhelming force. He recalled that he had previously pointed out
                            that if the enemy has a battalion on a position and we use two
                            battalions against him, we may take the position but losses can be high.
                            If instead we use as much as a division we will take the objective and
                            our losses will be much lower.</p>
                        <p>3. He said he thought we should avoid using specific numbers in
                            announcing our buildup. Specifically, he was troubled about the
                            announced figure of 50,000. Instead, he thought the statement<note n="2" xml:id="d104fn2">Reference is to the statement President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> made at his July 28 press
                                conference; see <ref target="#d97">Document 97</ref>.</note> should
                            have been “sufficient to win.”</p>
                        <p>4. I brought out that the figure of 50,000 had been coupled with the kind
                            of statement he proposed—“additional forces will be needed later and
                            they will be sent,” and that in fact planning and preparatory work is
                            going forward to provide all that General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> has asked for at a very rapid rate. He
                            reiterated his view that we do better to avoid specific numbers which
                            tend to suggest to our enemies that we are limited in our determination.
                            He would think it better simply to say that <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> within the past year or two has become an open battle
                            ground of freedom against Communism, and that we will do whatever is
                            needed to defeat Communism there.</p>
                        <p>5. He thought that the call for more draftees struck a good note because
                            it showed our seriousness of purpose. He commented that he had been
                            asked by many people while he was in Wisconsin, particularly <pb n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0324"/>by young people, just what we are going
                            to do about Viet-Nam. He said his answer was that we must win there—we
                            must stop the infiltration, stop the Communists from cutting South
                            Viet-Nam to pieces, and give the South Vietnamese a chance to build a
                            free society. He returned to his original point with a statement that
                            this is no time for “piddling” steps, and that such—in the present
                            situation, in which there has been an appeal to force—would be our
                            greatest weakness.</p>
                        <p>6. At this point I reviewed in terms of major units the planned
                            deployments to Viet-Nam in response to General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>'s request.</p>
                        <p>7. I next discussed the concept for the employment of the U.S. forces as
                            they close in the area. Secure bases will be provided at each of the key
                            points selected. There will be an ample security force (a brigade or
                            more), and normally a major logistics installation, and major tactical
                            air base capable of general operations. As forces are built up further,
                            they will be used for reaction operations, to fix and destroy Viet Cong
                            units of battalion or greater size when they form for attack, and as a
                            general reserve to locate, pin down and destroy Viet Cong main force
                            units through offensive action, and to attack the Viet Cong base areas.
                            As forces increase, the emphasis will shift toward offensive action on a
                            sustained basis to carry the fight without letup to the Viet Cong.
                            Maximum use will be made of air support, as well as artillery support,
                            in these operations. General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> indicated he thought well of this concept of
                            operations. I added that the Vietnamese will be expected to join in the
                            foregoing operations to a limited degree (commensurate with their
                            strength), but will particularly be responsible for locating and
                            destroying pockets of Viet Cong smaller units and for establishing
                            security in the countryside through wider areas. General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> thought these operations
                            were of very great importance. He emphasized that propaganda activities
                            should be intensified, and suggested that we be in position to extend to
                            any village taken over from the Viet Cong immediate assistance in the
                            form of food, medicines and the like. Such assistance, to be most
                            effective, should be given at once.</p>
                        <p>8. In the course of this discussion I reviewed the general situation in
                            South Viet-Nam, contrasting the situation observed in the Delta on my
                            recent trip (where a highly capable corps commander has his troops on
                            the offensive, carrying the fight to the Viet Cong with considerable
                            effectiveness) with other areas where the Viet Cong encroachment
                            continues, together with disruption of roads, railroads and all forms of
                            communication.</p>
                        <p>9. I next commented on operations against North Viet-Nam. I told him
                            consideration is being given at this moment to the question of expansion
                            of the scope of attack operations to include attacks on <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>, remaining <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>, and possible mining of major harbors. He said he
                            considered <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0325"/>that the selection
                            of targets (speaking of military targets) amounts at this stage to
                            deciding tactical matters. He thought that this is a matter for the
                            field commander. It is important to comprehend what war is, and make
                            sure we don't lose effect through detailed control away from the scene
                            of conflict. He thought it was essential to go after the <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> and the lines of communication, and
                            would mine the harbors without delay, telling the world to keep shipping
                            out of the area and making clear that there is to be no sanctuary. If
                            this is not done, we will pay in U.S. casualties in South Viet-Nam. He
                            emphasized that the way to keep international pressures down, and to
                            save lives is to win the struggle as quickly as possible.</p>
                        <p>10. Referring to the surface-to-air missiles, he said that in his
                            judgment we should have hit them before they became operational. He
                            added that he had understood that we were going to do this. He said he
                            would urge that we get the <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>'s
                            destroyed before they can be used. He said that, in fact, we should
                            strike quickly whenever we see a new kind of danger building up, and not
                            wait until it is in use. He commented that, operationally, there seems
                            to him to be too much of a brake on everything we do. If the North
                            Vietnamese use their <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>'s and
                            anti-aircraft in combination, as they are skillful enough to do, our air
                            operations will become much more difficult and costly.</p>
                        <p>11. I then outlined the program for force expansion which the President
                            had approved. I mentioned that the question whether to rely upon the
                            draft or call up reserves had received the most searching analysis and
                            careful consideration, culminating in a decision to rely upon the draft,
                            extend terms of service where permitted, and bring selected reserves to
                            a higher state of readiness. The net resulting difference between the
                            two methods will not be large; there might be some limited additional
                            delay in readiness of forces under the scheme adopted. This would be of
                            significance in case a contingency should occur in Europe. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> said he was not
                            concerned over this point. If we were to become involved in war in
                            Europe of any substantial proportions, he would not be for sending large
                            forces into the area, but would be for using every bomb we have.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows brief discussion of the Dominican Republic.]</p>
                        <p>13. General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>'s principal
                            suggestion was to recognize that we are at war in Viet-Nam, and not base
                            our action on “minimum needs” or a weak strike program against the
                            North, but to “swamp them.”</p>

                        <p>At Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CSD1">Cater</persName>'s invitation, the
                            group met for dinner at the White House Staff Mess to discuss the
                            Government's information program in the field of foreign affairs, and
                            primarily as it pertains to the domestic audience. The discussion
                            generally covered (a) the nature of the information problem and (b)
                            general and specific ideas and agencies for meeting the information
                            problem.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. The Nature of the Information Problem</p>
                        <p>(a) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CSD1">Cater</persName> said that, with
                            respect to public information, we lack many of the strengths we once
                            had. We don't seem to have independent validators of policy any more—the
                            Vandenbergs and the Connollys. We don't seem to have elder statesmen any
                                more—<persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> is the
                            exception. We don't seem to have the newscasting we once had—the Ed
                            Murrows and the Elmer Davises, to quieten us and to give us perspective;
                            instead, the nature of T.V. is such that we always seem to get our news
                            on a fragmentary basis. Finally, with the exception of the President,
                            the Government does not seem to have the spokesmen it once had. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CSD1">Cater</persName> went on to say that our
                            public posture is fragile; we rely too much on the President and too
                            much on specific facts. There seems to be no basic understanding of the
                            broader aspects on the part of the American people. And with this
                            situation, we are extremely vulnerable to rumor, gossip, and quick
                            reverses.</p>
                        <p>(b) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GJL1">Greenfield</persName>, with specific
                            reference to Vietnam, outlined a number of dimensions that he sees as
                            part of the information problem. First, we are always meeting the crisis
                            of the moment. In practice, there is little time to think about the long
                            term or the philosophical. We only plug holes and run as fast as we can
                            to stay even. Second, we seem to be obsessed by Vietnam. Foreigners
                            especially believe that the President thinks of nothing else but
                            Vietnam. This is not a healthy image.</p>
                        <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295" facs="0327"/>
                        <p>Third, we do not always keep the arithmetic in mind. There are almost 300
                            accredited correspondents in Vietnam and we must recognize that we are
                            going to have to live with some unfortunate stories—e.g., brutality by
                            Americans. Fourth, while our credibility with the press is improving, we
                            are still not credible enough. We suffer substantial losses when we are
                            not accurate, and there are plenty of inaccuracies. (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJA1">Califano</persName> seconded this point.) Fifth,
                            we do not have the highest quality military spokesmen in Vietnam; they
                            should be improved. Sixth, we are involved in too many cliches. Some of
                            them are all right but others may not be; we should re-examine them. For
                            example, we should look again at “Our country's honor is at stake”; one
                            day we may be sorry that we are tied too closely to this stand. Another
                            cliche we ought to examine is “Our friends won't trust us if we desert
                            the Vietnamese”; this one gives us trouble when foreigners say publicly
                            that they want us out of Vietnam—in effect, pulling the rug out from
                            under us. (Mr. Bundy and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCL1">Cooper</persName> differed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GJL1">Greenfield</persName> at this point; both agreed, however, that we
                            should make more of foreign statements which support our argument—e.g.,
                            Willy Brandt's reference to the conflict as “our war.”)</p>
                        <p>Seventh, we should probably try to do something about this curious
                            business involving newsmen who say “the American people don't know
                            what's going on.” When asked what they want, these newsmen say that they
                            want more specific facts (e.g., how many tons of bombs were dropped); at
                            the same time, they agree, when pressed, that the answer does not really
                            bear at all on the essence of the Vietnam situation. Maybe this curious
                            questioning relates to the proposition that the Vietnam war is different
                            from anything we've seen and that we are all groping for ways to
                            understand it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCL1">Cooper</persName> agreed
                            that part of the information problem does relate to the fact that
                            Vietnam represents a difficult and brand new type of warfare. While
                            correspondents may not think it is important when B-52's hit a rice
                            dump, it really is important. In short, we may not know how to fight the
                            war in Vietnam but the correspondents don't know how to report it
                            either.</p>
                        <p>(c) Mr. Jorden said that an essential element in our Vietnam information
                            problem is that the South Vietnamese don't say anything. They don't say
                            why they are fighting or where they are going. We must get them to state
                            their own case—that what they are doing is good, just, etc. It would not
                            only help with their own people but with the outside world as well.</p>
                        <p>Picking up on this thought, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCL1">Cooper</persName> said that unfortunately the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is shadowy—there is not even a <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> ambassador here. As a matter of fact,
                            for some time we have been trying in vain to get the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to do three relatively simple
                            things—appoint an ambassador to the U.S.; appoint an information officer
                            to the U.S.; and hire an American public relations firm to represent the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in the U.S. Partly as a result
                            of the <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0328"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s ineffectual and mushy public
                            information program, the American people do not think we are really
                            associated with anyone in Vietnam. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH1">Marks</persName> seconded this point and noted that the American
                            people do not really understand that the South Vietnamese have committed
                            500,000 people to the struggle.</p>
                        <p>(d) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJ1">Chancellor</persName> said that this
                            is indeed a remarkable situation; we are faced with an entirely
                            different kind of war and there is no participation in the public
                            information field by the people one would expect to hear from the
                            most—e.g., South Vietnam, North Vietnam, and the Viet Cong. (Some
                            members of the group noted that the Viet Cong was indeed very active in
                            the field.) In essence, perhaps we have, for the first time in our
                            experience, a non-packageable commodity. Perhaps, therefore, we should
                            try to emulate the 19th century British and try to get a sort of general
                            commitment and support by the American people rather than a specific
                            commitment and support for Vietnam. The “This is a long-term
                            proposition—we are a world power and are stuck with this sort of thing”
                            psychology may in fact bring greater comfort to the American people than
                            the definition of the struggle as one of sharp confrontation. Mr. Bundy
                            recognized the force in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJ1">Chancellor</persName>'s argument but added, among other things,
                            that we could never hope for enough support, in the general sense, to do
                            the job. We must get involved in the specifics as well. We are faced
                            with a situation of instant transmission of village episodes. The
                            Communists know this dimension and deal with it effectively; we, too,
                            must cope with this dimension.</p>
                        <p>(e) Mr. Leibman said that the American people do not yet really
                            understand how we got into Vietnam in the first place; they have
                            received only generalities and they need specifics. Mr. Bundy agreed
                            that there is a problem here, but thought that this particular piece of
                            exposition might simply not be manageable. Our best posture may be to
                            say simply that somehow we are there and that we have to stay.</p>
                        <p>(f) The group noted that the nature of the information problem in Vietnam
                            is changing in some respects. Mr. Leibman said that the problem will be
                            intensified immeasurably when the effects of the doubling of the draft
                            are felt. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJ1">Chancellor</persName> said that
                            the press is just beginning to get active in Vietnam. With increased
                            staffs, we are going to get fewer people doing general interpretive work
                            and we are going to get more of the poignant, Ernie Pyle-type stories.
                            This may help our effort in getting support from the American people as
                            the war starts to hit them locally. In this regard, Mr. Leibman noted
                            that it may be useful to consider building local heroes rather than
                            national heroes.</p>
                        <p>(g) The group discussed the similarities and differences between the
                            Korean War and the Vietnamese war. Mr. Bundy said that the American
                            people may have more patience than they did during Korea; twelve years
                            have passed. He noted that people have been saying for the past <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0329"/>several years that the American
                            people would explode if nothing decisive happened in Vietnam; yet, there
                            has been no explosion. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CSD1">Cater</persName>
                            noted the anomaly of Korea which, in fact, was a real success story but
                            was never understood as such by the American people. The job is even
                            tougher in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>(h) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GJL1">Greenfield</persName> raised two
                            questions which were largely left unanswered by the group: What reaction
                            would we like to get from the American people and from foreigners? Why
                            do people seem to understand that it is necessary to fight over Berlin
                            but not over Vietnam?</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Meeting the Information Problem</p>
                        <p>(a) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCL1">Cooper</persName> ticked off some of
                            the specific projects that are now under way. First, there are the
                            “American Friends of Vietnam.” While they still have a long way to go,
                            they have done some good work; they work with students, publish a
                            journal, run a speakers' bureau and have an elaborate mailing list.
                            While the Government has been helping and advising this group, we can't
                            get too involved; if it becomes too closely identified with the U.S.
                            Government, its credibility will be badly affected. Second, we have sent
                            30 students to Vietnam. Our follow-up will, of course, be crucial.
                            Third, we have brought some Vietnamese intellectuals over here. Fourth,
                            we have been providing kits to certain speakers. There are other
                            projects too.</p>
                        <p>(b) Mr. Leibman said that the key elements that had been raised are the
                            complexity and built-in contradiction of policy and the need for
                            perspective and continuity. With regard to continuity, we should use
                            more effectively the President's experience. Remember that “he was
                            there” for 30 years. Mr. Leibman went on to say that part of the answer
                            lies in using the private sector effectively. The private sector is
                            anxious to be used.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Leibman then went on to describe a number of possible projects that
                            might be explored. First, perhaps the private sector could brief
                            journalists and editors. There are plenty of institutions and schools
                            that would be willing and anxious to do the job. Second, we could put
                            into effect the “That Was the Week That Was” concept to get across the
                            idea of perspective and “the whole chessboard.” Third, we could make use
                            of the Industrial College of the Armed Forces graduates. Fourth, with
                            respect to high school teachers, there are three different types of
                            programs that could be used—(a) special summer institutes on appropriate
                            political subjects; (b) special programs for all teacher attendees at
                            summer school; (c) year-round programs for teachers as part of
                            in-service training. Fifth, we could use trade association forums. Mr.
                            Leibman added that these ideas are only illustrative. The point is that
                            there is a vacuum. If we don't fill it, then it will be filled against
                            us. He went on to emphasize that the teach-in problem is almost here
                            again and that we should be ready.</p>
                        <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0330"/>
                        <p>(c) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GJL1">Greenfield</persName> noted that the
                            only thing that makes our present posture swing is that the people have
                            confidence in the President. Mr. Leibman added that this is one reason
                            why the President must always be absolutely credible. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CSD1">Cater</persName> interjected that this is evidence
                            of how fragile our posture is and went on to say that the President
                            should not have to bear the whole burden of explanation.</p>
                        <p>(d) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJA1">Califano</persName> made the point
                            that there was great merit in repetition. The President and other
                            spokesmen in the Administration should keep repeating the same facts
                            again and again.</p>
                        <p>(e) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCL1">Cooper</persName> noted Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJ1">Chancellor</persName>'s point that there will be an
                            increase in coverage of Vietnam. He went on to suggest that we give
                            serious consideration to educating the editors so that they know which
                            stories are significant and fit to print.</p>
                        <p>(f) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GJL1">Greenfield</persName> said that we
                            can only use the private sector effectively if there are effective
                            Government spokesmen to support. And there are only four people who can
                            give the Government position effectively—the President, Rusk, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, and Bundy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJ1">Chancellor</persName> said that Bundy is probably
                            not good for the housewife in the back yard; unfortunately, Bundy
                            appeals to the sophisticated and the sophisticated are already rigid in
                            their confusion or in their position pro or con the Administration in
                            Vietnam. Only the other three can do the job that is needed—and, for
                            that matter, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> probably
                            less than Rusk.</p>
                        <p>(g) The group talked at some length about the problem of coordination of
                            the information effort. Mr. Leibman, while recognizing the dangers of
                            too much coordination, noted that it seemed to him that all sorts of
                            people were involved but that no one was clearly carrying the ball or
                            coordinating the effort. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJA1">Califano</persName> said that there is a real need for
                            orchestration on the Government side. Moreover, the only one who can
                            really do the coordinating job effectively and get the right response
                            from the major players is Bundy or <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Moyers</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CSD1">Cater</persName>
                            said that what is needed is a sort of Tsar on the outside—a man with
                            great prestige, preferably from New York, who could pull together and
                            coordinate on the private side. Mr. Bundy agreed that there is a
                            coordination problem as well as the ever-present problem of “finding the
                            right man.” He went on to say, however, that the private sector would
                            probably not sit still for a ringmaster. He also suggested that perhaps
                            we do not want to get so heavily organized either in the Government or
                            in the private sector in the area of public information.<note n="2" xml:id="d105fn2">A follow-up meeting was held on August 4.

                        <p>1. You should know that the British have followed up very briskly on
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>'s letter of last

                            has sent word to Dean Rusk that the British, as Chairman of the Security
                            Council this month, feel that they would be seeming to question our
                            sincerity if they did not press very hard to find ways of having an
                            early meeting of the Security Council on Vietnam. In presenting this
                            view, the British have also presented a resolution which would match an
                            end of our bombing against an unpoliced North Vietnamese undertaking to
                            send no more forces into the South—a notion which is plainly
                            unacceptable to us.<note n="3" xml:id="d106fn3"> Rusk and British

                        <p>2. Dean Rusk has given the British a very skillful answer, stressing the
                            need for intense private consultation before there is any Security
                            Council meeting, and pointing out the defects in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> draft resolution. Meanwhile, <persName corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName> talked yesterday to U Thant in New

                        <p>3. It is obviously going to be hard for State and <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> to keep the right balance

                            remains to be seen whether Foreign Minister Stewart is really as

                        <p>Last night's attack on the <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> facility
                            at Danang has introduced a new factor into the considerations of a
                            pause.</p>
                        <p>If a pause is to have the desired propaganda and political effect, it
                            must be abundantly clear that we have voluntarily held back our vast
                            power. While the attack on our <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>
                            storage facilities in Danang will, in fact, have no effect on our
                            capabilities to bomb the North, the Communists can make a good case that
                            any early pause was merely making a virtue of necessity. (You will
                            recall that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and Hanoi proclaimed
                            that our earlier pause was dictated by a lack of fuel and the need to
                            repair our planes.) Thus, this overnight development might detract
                            somewhat from the propaganda effect of an early pause. But the political
                            signal we will be sending will not necessarily be muted; Moscow, Hanoi,
                            Peiping and even the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> know that our
                            logistic capabilities in the Far East cannot be significantly reduced by
                            the destruction of a few <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> tanks, and
                            they know that we have sufficient capability within the 7th Fleet alone
                            to destroy everything of value in North Vietnam. If they are waiting for
                            a signal, they can still read this one loud and clear. In any case, a
                            few news stories about our large <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>
                            reserves in the area and our impressive resupply capability, a
                            continuation of our bombings on the North until the pause, and a heavy
                            bombing program in the South might jointly remove much of the air from
                            the propaganda balloon.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Timing and Announcement</p>
                        <p>If we decide on a pause (pros and cons are discussed below), I think we
                            should implement it soon enough so that it appears to be part of the
                            President's package of July 28,<note n="2" xml:id="d107fn2">See <ref target="#d98">Document 98</ref>.</note> i.e., within a week or
                            so. There are other advantages to doing it sooner rather than later:</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> will still be
                            here, and it will be easier to deal with any Communist responses and
                            U.S. counter-moves on the political/diplomatic <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301" facs="0333"/>front when he is in Washington. Of
                            lesser importance, but still worth noting, is that a pause prior to
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>'s trip to Hanoi (if,
                            indeed, he decides to go) would give us propaganda points in Africa; a
                            pause prior to Sukarno's 17th of August speech<note n="3" xml:id="d107fn3"> Sukarno addressed the 20th Anniversary Celebration
                                of Indonesian Independence August 17 in Djakarta; his address is
                                printed in part in <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy:
                                    Current Documents, 1965</hi>, pp. 757-758.</note> might tone him
                            down a little; a pause at this stage of the disarmament conference might
                            also help the atmosphere at Geneva.</p>
                        <p>My own view would be to stop the bombing without a prior public
                            announcement, but with prior confidential discussion with key allies and
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. If possible, the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            (but not the Chinese—let's keep them stewing on the outside) should be
                            informed through trusted intermediaries. Obviously, a day or two without
                            bombing will arouse great curiosity. In answer to queries, we can state
                            that we are testing the atmosphere, following up on the President's
                            statement, giving <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> a leg
                            up, etc., etc. We should make no commitments in public or private about
                            the duration of our suspension.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Pros and Cons</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">The Case for a Pause:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. It will continue the momentum toward settlement created by the
                            conciliatory portions of the President's press conference statement; the
                            fact that a pause is taking place in an interval of military build-up
                            and after additional sizeable military appropriations should minimize a
                            possible interpretation of “weakness”.</p>
                        <p>2. It will create, specifically, the most favorable possible climate for
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>'s exploratory trip and
                            should increase the pressure on Hanoi for a more conciliatory response
                            to <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>.</p>
                        <p>3. It will ease the mounting domestic pressures on our allies (above all,
                            the Japanese, whose difficulties are becoming severe, but also the
                            British, Canadians, and Australians).</p>
                        <p>4. It will meet the persistent objections of friendly unaligned nations
                            and leaders (primarily U Thant, the Indians, and the Yugoslavs).</p>
                        <p>5. Even if a pause produces no response, it can increase our own room for
                            maneuver within our military track by establishing early an
                            understandable pattern of strikes and pauses; in this regard, each week
                            that passes without a second pause compounds the significance—and the
                            controversial nature, in the U.S. Government and general public—of the
                            pause concept itself. We need to de-fuse this issue in order to free our
                            hands.</p>
                        <p>6. It will improve the atmospherics, although having no effect on the
                            substance, of the Geneva disarmament talks.</p>
                        <pb n="302" xml:id="pg_302" facs="0334"/>
                        <p>7. It will meet one persistent demand of our domestic critics and
                            waverers.</p>
                        <p>8. It will further dramatize the good faith of our quest for a negotiated
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>9. It will permit a more careful testing of Hanoi's interest in
                            negotiations, if any such inclination exists.</p>
                        <p>10. It may allow Moscow increased leverage in pressing Hanoi toward
                            negotiations, if any such inclination is present within the Soviet
                            leadership. At the same time it may develop strains between Hanoi and
                            Peiping and develop yet additional strains between Moscow and
                            Peiping.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">The Case Against a Pause:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. It may cause deep apprehensions regarding U.S. determination within
                            the already-weakened <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. An extended pause will permit the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            to catch its breath, repair damaged communications, and increase its
                            assistance to the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>3. It will appear to the Communist side an admission of the
                            ineffectiveness of the bombings and an indication of U.S. desperation
                            for “negotiations now”.</p>
                        <p>4. It will arouse strong criticism among domestic proponents of
                            toughness—particularly among Republicans who are looking for a way to
                            make capital out of any signs of Administration softness in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>5. It might make a return to air strikes difficult in the context of
                            predictable international pressures to keep the suspension permanent
                            (although resumption of bombings after the last pause was not that
                            difficult).</p>
                        <p>6. It is a move to which such intermediaries as the Yugoslavs wistfully
                            refer, but not with fierce conviction; it is not a move that the Soviets
                            are pushing with vigor.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">On Balance</p>
                        <p>I favor a pause starting in the next week or so. However, I also think we
                            should give some urgent attention to what sort of signal from Hanoi or
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> we would regard as significant.
                            (Surely we don't really expect the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            to withdraw its Division from South Vietnam during the period of
                            cessation. On the other hand, we should expect something meaningful in
                            terms of a drop in the scale of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            military activity or a clarification or modification of Communist
                            talking terms.) We should also give thought now to the problem of
                            communication with the other side after the initiation of a pause. None
                            of the would-be intermediaries (the French, the Algerians, etc.) are

                        <p>4. Discussion led by the President on the possibility of a bombing pause.
                            In this discussion, the following would be important commentators:</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>—(pro) Arthur can make
                            his own case better than anyone else, if not more briefly. It is surely
                            important that everyone understand the fact that it is the bombing which
                            is now the target of international pressure. Some, but not all, of this
                            pressure is orchestrated from Moscow. Interestingly enough, the bombing
                            is not the centerpiece of propaganda from Hanoi or Peiping, nor is there
                            any indication from either of these Asian capitals that a pause in the
                            bombing would have any effect whatever.</p>
                        <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0336"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>—(con for now) While Bob
                            believes strongly that at some point a substantial pause may be an
                            important diplomatic card, he would not play the card at a time when it
                            might be thought to come from weakness. He would prefer a sustained
                            pause at a somewhat later stage, after we have shown that we can hold
                            our own, and perhaps even make some money in the South.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MLH1">Marks</persName>—I think Leonard should be
                            asked for comment on the world opinion aspect of this matter. I do not
                            know his current judgment.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>—if you call on him—will
                            surely go very hard on the military advantages of continuous bombing.
                            Even if he does not make the argument explicitly, he will remind those
                            present that many Americans will find it odd to pause in the bombing
                            that is supposed to restrict aggression just at the time when we are
                            sending ground forces to take casualties in resisting that same
                            aggression.</p>
                        <p>Rusk—(pretty much con) Dean is inclined to think that we ought not to
                            have a pause until there is some clear signal that it would be matched
                            in some way by the other side. You may wish to ask him what specific
                            matching action we would find acceptable. We need to have a more solid
                            opinion on this point than we have now. (My own judgment is that it will
                            be hard to find a realistic short-term matching action, because such
                            action needs to be visible and provable in order to be acceptable to us,
                            and the only visible actions are in South Vietnam, where the people in
                            Hanoi have to maintain that they have no influence. This is one reason
                            why a long pause at a time of relative U.S. strength seems to me more
                            sensible than a short one now. From a position of strength, we would not
                            have to insist upon public and prompt matching action; we could simply
                            let matters develop for a while with the diplomatic pressure on the
                            other side.)</p>
                        <p>Just as a checklist, I list the following set of pros and cons:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Pro</p>
                        <p>1. Pause will sustain peaceful momentum of press conference.</p>
                        <p>2. Pause will help our allies deal with domestic pressure, especially
                            Japanese.</p>
                        <p>3. Pause will reassert our flexibility and give us leeway to move up and
                            down in the future.</p>
                        <p>4. Pause will please domestic peacemakers.</p>
                        <p>5. Pause may put some diplomatic pressure on Hanoi, during <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> visit.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Con</p>
                        <p>1. Pause may arouse apprehension in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>2. Pause will give real military advantage to Hanoi.</p>
                        <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0337"/>
                        <p>3. Pause may seem sign of weakness to the Communists—or even a reward for
                            propaganda pressure.</p>
                        <p>4. Pause may be sharply criticized by Republicans and other
                            hardliners.</p>
                        <p>5. Pause will do no real good diplomatically.</p>
                        <p>I am afraid this memorandum is not as evenly balanced as I would like,
                            but that defect at least shows you where I myself come out.</p>

                        <p>This is not an argument for or against contacts with the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> (although I can't resist the
                            opportunity to cast an affirmative vote). Rather it is an attempt to
                            explore how best to make such contacts, on the assumption that a
                            decision is taken to do so.</p>
                        <p>There are four key questions:</p>
                        <p>Where should the contact be maintained?</p>
                        <p>Whom should the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> rely on to undertake
                            such contacts?</p>
                        <p>How and to what extent should the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> be
                            cut in?</p>
                        <p>How can we insure that the contact is legitimate rather than a Communist
                            propaganda ploy?</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Front Abroad</p>
                        <p>The Front maintains representatives in Cuba, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Algeria, Czechoslovakia, Indonesia, East Germany,
                            China and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. In addition, <pb n="306" xml:id="pg_306" facs="0338"/>there appears to be a floating
                            delegation of uncertain stature in France and some slightly irregular
                            and clandestine representation in Cambodia. None of the places where the
                            Front maintains an office seems ideal for discreet contacts, and some of
                            them are patently undesirable. To complicate the matter further, we know
                            very little about the calibre, status and personality of any of the
                            individuals in place. It is likely, however, that once we decide on a
                            locus of contact and once the Front is convinced we are ready for
                            serious talk, the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> will see to it
                            that their man is suitable at least from their point of view.</p>
                        <p>There are several reasons why Algiers, at this moment at least, seems to
                            be the best place for contact:</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> man now in place, Huynh Van Tam,
                            is personally known to some Americans (see the attached account of
                            Gottlieb's recent conversation with him).<note n="2" xml:id="d109fn2">Attached but not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Of all the places where the Front now has representation, Algiers is
                            probably the “loosest”.</p>
                        <p>Willy, nilly, we may find ourselves (hopefully unofficially) in contact
                            with Their Man in Algiers. We are still awaiting some word on how (or
                            even if) the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and the Algerians want to
                            deliver Hertz. It is clear from my talks with the Algerian Ambassador
                            that whatever the precise details may be, the essence of the plan will
                            be to exploit the exchange for at least a propaganda U.S.-<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> contact and hopefully for a more
                            substantive relationship.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Means of Contact</p>
                        <p>I assume that whatever direct contact we may wish to maintain should be
                            unofficial, very low key, and deniable. This obviously eliminates our
                            Embassy and, in my view, the press. It still leaves three kinds of
                            people: Academic types, Responsible Professional Peaceniks, and just
                            plain Private Citizens. I will, if you desire, shake up some possible
                            candidates in the first two categories (Lucien Pye comes immediately to
                            mind in the Academic field, possibly Gottlieb in the Peacenik area). But
                            I have an inspiration within the 3rd category: Burke Hertz—who, if we
                            can deliver his brother, on the Algiers track, will have ostensibly good
                            reasons for an occasional chat; he is an able bright lawyer, a liberal
                            Democrat, and by now fairly sophisticated in the care and feeding of the
                            Viet Cong. He will need an interpreter since he doesn't speak French,
                            but I think Bill Colby can find one.</p>
                        <p>Obviously, whoever is chosen, he will have to be someone who the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> thinks has an official ear, if not an
                            official voice.</p>

                            Problem</p>
                        <p>It would be prudent to cut the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, at
                            least the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, in on the fact that some
                            American is talking to a Front man (the consequences of it being leaked
                            to them would be more difficult and delicate to handle than a frank
                            admission at the outset). We have a tricky path ahead in our relations
                            with Saigon, and we should tie them to us as we take each step. This is
                            not to say that we have to admit much official interest or direction to
                            the contacts.</p>

                            concerned, its purposes may be well served by publicizing the fact of
                            the contact and distorting the substance of the talks. Perhaps our only
                            protection here is to insure that we can make a credible case for
                            denying any official sanction or character to the talks. This means that
                            both the instrument and his channel to U.S. policy makers will have to
                            be ready to be the patsies.</p>

                        <p>Secretary Rusk: Reported to the President on his recent meeting with the
                            House Foreign Affairs Committee. For the present, there is good support
                            in the committee.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: In both the
                            Senate and the House Committees, there is broad support, but this
                            support is thin. There is a feeling of uneasiness and frustration. There
                            is criticism of our allies for not helping <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0340"/>more in Vietnam. A minority of committee members
                            believes we are not bombing targets of value. The Republicans are making
                            political capital by overstating the effect on the U.S. economy of the
                            cost of the Vietnam war.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>: The increase in
                            U.S. forces gave a lift to the South Vietnamese. We do agree with
                            Vietnam on war aims, even though General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> may state, for domestic consumption, that he wants to
                            invade the North. The Saigon Government accepts the principles of the
                            Geneva Accords and is not going to march North. Viet Cong attacks are
                            slowing down. Saigon does not object to our contacts with the other
                            side, but it would worry if we stopped our military pressure on Hanoi
                            during any talks.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> is a young man, but he
                            is better than one would imagine. He may mature. General <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName> is a stabilizing force. He
                            prefers to sit in the background, consequently, he will not take the
                            post of Prime Minister. The present Saigon Government framework is solid
                            but the members of the new government are not yet well-known to us.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> is no administrator but
                            he has a strong social conscience.</p>
                        <p>The present military situation is serious but not desperate. No one knows
                            how much Viet Cong resilience is still left. The arrival of additional
                            U.S. forces must have convinced Hanoi that their chance of winning the
                            war is lessening.</p>
                        <p>No problem has yet arisen as to the U.S.-South Vietnamese command
                            structure. We are not raising the issue, but are dealing with it on a
                            case-by-case basis.</p>
                        <p>By the end of 1965, the North Vietnamese offensive will be bloodied and
                            defeated without having achieved major gains. Hanoi may then decide to
                            change its policy. 1966 could be a decisive year. We should seek to
                            increase the South Vietnamese military forces and limit the size of U.S.
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>Political fragility continues in South Vietnam. We hope that the
                            political situation is at last settling down. Based on recent local
                            elections, a national election held now would not go to Ho Chi Minh.</p>
                        <p>The military side of the war in South Vietnam is not overstressed as some
                            allege. Security must come before a satisfactory political situation can
                            develop.</p>
                        <p>At the time our combat forces arrived, the morale in South Vietnam was
                            uncertain but their confidence grew when we began our bombing. This
                            bombing is effective in that it reminds Hanoi of the increasing cost of
                            the war to them. As to the effect of the bombing pause, on balance it
                            was neutral—not all good and not all bad.</p>
                        <p>As to the press, thanks to the press attache, Barry Zorthian, relations
                            with the correspondents are much better than two years ago. There
                            continue <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0341"/>to be a few
                            irresponsible correspondents who cause trouble and have a desire to
                            express things in the negative.</p>
                        <p>The President: We are getting only bad things from the press.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZB1">Zorthian</persName>: A minority of the
                            correspondents cause trouble. Unfortunately, they get more coverage
                            because they work for some of the wire services and some TV networks.
                            Many foreigners represent U.S. press agencies in Saigon. There is a
                            certain amount of advocacy and many of the young correspondents have
                            chips on their shoulders. We should demand that news editors in the
                            United States present a balanced picture in their news reports. <gloss target="#t_AP1">AP</gloss> reporter Arnett is extremely critical of
                            the entire war effort.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>: reported on
                            his recent conversations with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TM2">Tito</persName>:</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, who speaks for his
                            government, does not want to get the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            involved in the Vietnam problem. He says U.S. bombing will not succeed.
                            As to Soviet influence on Hanoi, he says the Viet Cong are as
                            independent as they say they are.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets are anxious to avoid war. Their real battle is with the
                            Chinese. They want to maintain the status quo in Europe and in their
                            relations with us.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TM2">Tito</persName> believes the Chinese are the
                            danger—not because they are Communists but because they are nationalists
                            and imperialists. On Vietnam, he offered no proposals as to how to end
                            the war.</p>

                            <item>The President, Foreign Minister Quaison-Sackey, the Ambassador of
                                Ghana, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill Moyers</persName>, Mr.

                        </list>
                        <p>1. The President greeted the Foreign Minister warmly, and took him and
                            the Ambassador into his small office. He opened the conversation by a
                            friendly reference to the Ambassador's recent trip to Lake Jackson <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310" facs="0342"/>in Texas. The Ambassador
                            reported that he had enjoyed the trip very much and that he looked
                            forward to an opportunity to show this same work on desalinization to
                            the Minister of his Government mainly concerned with these matters. The
                            President told the Foreign Minister that the Ambassador was going to be
                            regarded as a citizen of Texas, and then turned to the Foreign Minister
                            attentively and expectantly.</p>
                        <p>2. The Foreign Minister said that he brought the President the very warm
                            greetings of President <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>,
                            and a letter.<note n="2" xml:id="d111fn2">In this August 4 letter,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> stated that
                                    <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> had informed
                                him that he would not be able to guarantee <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>'s safety if he visited Hanoi
                                because of U.S. bombing of North Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> asked for a pause in the bombing to enable
                                him to travel to Hanoi to pursue “this fine opportunity directed
                                towards the achievement of a peaceful settlement in Vietnam.”
                                (Department of State, EA/ACA Files: Lot 69 D 277, Ghanaian Mission
                                1965)</note> He handed the letter to the President. The President
                            joked about the large number of red seals on the letter, produced a
                            pocketknife, opened it carefully, and read it aloud.</p>
                        <p>3. As soon as he had finished reading the letter, the President gave the
                            Foreign Minister a categorical assurance that no U.S. military
                            operations would interfere with any visit to Hanoi by President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>. The President said
                            (1) we are not bombing Hanoi, (2) we have not intensified our bombing of
                            North Vietnam, (3) the President will be in no danger, and (4) who is he
                            kidding? (probably referring to Ho, not <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>). The President continued that a peaceful
                            settlement would never be blocked because of any action of the United
                            States. If the aggression ceases, our resistance ceases. Nobody wanted
                            peace more than the United States, and if the efforts of Ghana could get
                            the aggressors to stop, we would stop resistance to the aggression. The
                            President repeated that no one needed to be worried about getting hurt
                            in Hanoi—there was no danger in a visit to Hanoi in search of peace.</p>
                        <p>4. The President told the Ghanaians that they knew what he thought—that
                            he thought all nations should be happy together—that the world should
                            look forward to a time of peace and progress. The President noted that
                            this had been a great day for progress in the United States, with the
                            signing of the voting rights bill, and his guests enthusiastically
                            agreed, saying that they had seen the ceremony on television and been
                            greatly moved by it.</p>
                        <p>5. The Foreign Minister said that the reason for the letter was the
                            report of the Ghanaian mission to Hanoi which had experienced some
                            difficulties. It had been given military escort from Peking to Hanoi in
                            a flight which gave rise to some concern. It had heard the sounds of
                            guns on many occasions in Hanoi, and it had advised President <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> not to go to Hanoi at this time.
                            But President <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> wanted very
                            much to go, and he therefore asked whether bombings could not cease for
                            three or <pb n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0343"/>four days. Then
                            perhaps he could work for a cessation of all hostilities during peace
                            talks. President <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> felt that
                            he must do all he could for a cease-fire, and this was the explanation
                            for what the Foreign Minister had come to call “the fever-heat
                            diplomacy” of his sudden visit to Washington.</p>
                        <p>6. The President replied that he was happy to see the Foreign Minister
                            and repeated that the Foreign Minister should return to his President
                            and say (1) that we have not bombed Hanoi and that he need not be
                            frightened, and (2) that if he can get the aggression stopped, there
                            will be peace overnight.</p>
                        <p>7. The President repeated again that no one wanted peace more than the
                            United States, but he said that no one would be allowed to gobble up
                            little countries. We would stay there and ensure the right of
                            self-determination. We would not run out of there. But the President
                            said once again that President <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> need not be concerned by the bombs that had
                            never fallen on Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>8. The Foreign Minister raised very gently the question whether the
                            President would wish to receive President <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> either before or after his visit to Hanoi. The
                            President said he thought we should wait until after President <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> got back from Hanoi, and then we
                            would see. So far, visitors in Hanoi had produced no hope from the other
                            side. This matter was left entirely open, but it was made quite plain by
                            omission that the President did not expect to see President <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> before his visit to Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>9. The President, in closing, made it very clear that he himself thought
                            the North Vietnamese suggestion that President <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> would be in danger was a fraud,
                            and the friendly chuckles of his guests made it appear that they
                            personally did not disagree. It was agreed that the meeting would not be
                            discussed in detail, but that the Press Secretary would give a brief
                            summary of the contents of President <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>'s message and of the oral reply which the
                            President had given. The President would send a written reply
                                promptly,<note n="3" xml:id="d111fn3">On August 6, Johnson sent a

                                Ghanaian Embassy, which summarized the points he had made in his
                                conversation with Quaison-Sackey. (Ibid.)</note> and it was
                            tentatively agreed that the two letters would be released after the
                            Foreign Minister had carried the reply back and delivered it to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>.</p>

                            satisfaction, the meeting ended. The two visitors had clearly been both
                            impressed and pleased by their reception.<note n="4" xml:id="d111fn4">On

                                another letter to Johnson in which he explained that his Foreign
                                Minister had not been privy to all the information that he had
                                received from Hanoi. The information had encouraged him to feel that
                                there was a good possibility that he could broker a negotiated
                                settlement of the conflict. He reviewed the North Vietnamese
                                position, as he understood it, and suggested that he come to
                                Washington to discuss it with Johnson. (Johnson Library, National
                                Security File, Memos to the President, McGeorge Bundy, Vol. XIII)
                                Johnson replied on August 13 in a letter in which he encouraged
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> again to undertake
                                his mission to Hanoi. He stated, however, that he felt a meeting in
                                Washington was unnecessary until it developed that a firm basis for
                                negotiations had been established. (Ibid.)</note>

                        <p>On August 6, 1965, the United States established direct contact with

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">“Initial talking points for X:</p>
                        <p>“1. These were to be simple and vague, but to set limits in which talks
                            can safely take place.</p>
                        <p>“2. X was to show desire for peace, and a free, independent, and unified
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>“3. X was to say that the prolongation of conflict is bound to lead to
                            progressively larger US pressures and long-term China control in <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>“4. X was to insist that nothing can force the US out. Indeed, X was to
                            say that pressures in the US to a wider war were growing and that it
                            would be increasingly harder to exercise restraint.</p>
                        <p>“5. If R[upert] does not seem receptive to a second meeting, then proceed
                            as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Theme: US is flexible to some degree. See, for example, the President's
                            press conference of 28 July.</p>
                        <p>“a. US ready to discuss the four points.</p>
                        <p>“b. People of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> have a right to peace
                            and to determine their own destiny in free elections in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> or throughout Vietnam under
                            international supervision.</p>
                        <p>“c. The four points, in some measure, parallel our own. Are we right in
                            assuming these points are not stated as the only basis for starting
                            talks and that other points can be discussed?</p>
                        <p>“d. The four points mention withdrawal of forces. The US says it will do
                            so once <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> ‘is secure from outside
                            aggression.’</p>
                        <p>“e. We did not ask <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> to be our ally or
                            to keep US bases there — although a ‘sovereign government should have
                            the right to call for help if necessary in its own self-defense.’</p>
                        <p>“f. US is not opposed to unification ‘at some future time under
                            democratic processes.’</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">“Purpose of X's mission:</p>
                        <p>“Primary—To ascertain whether any serious purpose to negotiate exists
                            and, if so, on what basis? Secondary—R as possible contact?
                            Third—clarify the four points (prerequisite or best basis, timing on
                            unification and elections, a settlement in accord with <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> program, timing on withdrawal).
                            Fourth—Collateral intelligence (<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>

                            preliminary conversation with him this afternoon with no others present.
                            Following are principal points:</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> took line similar to
                            that he has used with previous interlocutors. This interesting to degree
                            that he was aware on basis <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>'s introduction that report would probably go
                            straight to official quarters. X believes that Rupert's comments to him
                            were made on instructions.</p>
                        <p>2. X adhered to script, points 1 through 15,<note n="3" xml:id="d113fn3">Presumably a reference to <persName corresp="#p_GES1">Gullion</persName>'s instructions; see <ref target="#d112">Document 112</ref>.</note> at which point <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> obviously ready to say little
                            until other shoe dropped. Confirmed that situation was as X described it
                            but problem was what to do about it. His country wanted only peace, had
                            been obliged to fight against foreign domination for twenty years and
                            had maintained its independence for thousands of years with only slight
                            interruptions. He did not agree or disagree with X's direr predictions
                            but appeared depressed by prospects.</p>
                        <p>3. Before continuing per script and discussing conceivable variants
                                <persName corresp="#p_Dong1">Dong</persName>'s four points X asked
                            whether Hanoi ready to consider discussions or negotiations touching not
                            only on these but also on other points; whether withdrawal of forces was
                            pre-condition of negotiations or discussions (in which case X judged no
                            chance); what modalities <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> could envisage for re-unification; whether and
                            when the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could be accepted as
                            “interlocuteur valable”; and if not who would be acceptable. X noted
                            that the “four points” referred several times to the “zones” of Vietnam,
                            seeming to envisage separation for longer or shorter time. X also
                            claimed that Peking originally broadcast four points without the
                            conjoint declaration and always gave Hanoi's position a harder line
                            aspect than Hanoi did. X did not raise question of representation of
                            Liberation Front.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> seemed to see this as
                            getting down to cases, appeared slightly agitated, went to his office
                            and brought back notes from which he spoke (from instructions?). Re
                            troop withdrawal he stressed that any “solution” must of course include
                            it, but confirmed that there would be “<pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0347"/>modalities” including staging and timing. Even
                            convening of discussions should stipulate withdrawal as one of
                            objects.</p>
                        <p>5. As to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> said Conference of Geneva was
                            “a valid international instance” and the accords “a valid base”. The
                            Geneva mechanism brought together the interested countries, which was
                            absolutely necessary to a settlement. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> said categorically that his country rejected any
                            intervention of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> despite X's
                            suggestion that U Thant or member states might limit their activities to
                            good offices.</p>
                        <p>6. With respect to unification <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> said Geneva Accords themselves provided for
                            “zones” but accords also recognized Vietnam as constituted by a single
                            people. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> contemplated
                            short or considerably longer interval before reunification but stressed
                            latter could only be on basis of free decision and consultation between
                            Vietnamese people; charged that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh
                                Diem</persName> backed by U.S. had blocked elections. This couldn't
                            be allowed to happen again, said <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>, but he gave no sign that elections had to occur
                            soon. Pending reunification <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> said they wanted freer movement between zones,
                            more trade, etc. (X infers that there are differences possibly existing
                            between north and south which might influence attitude of north, which
                            would not however drop its insistence on long term unification and would
                            be confident of achieving it.)</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> raised question of
                            representation of national front, declared it solely qualified to
                            represent the south. X merely cited public statements this point by
                            Secretary and President.</p>
                        <p>8. Re Pham Van Dong's four points, <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> betrayed interest in X's allegations concerning
                            Chinese treatment of them. (Documentation on this would be useful;
                                <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> also nodded head
                            once or twice in response to references by X to China in his opening
                            discourse.) He was, however, much less clear on relation of four points
                            as a package to convening of a possible conference than he was on other
                            points cited above. (X believes there may be semantic confusion in
                                <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>'s mind or between
                            Paris and Hanoi, or perhaps more substantive disagreement between
                            factions of Hanoi Government on this point.) <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> said that principles
                            incorporated in the four points “must be recognized as creating the
                            possibilities for a solution.” However, he also called them the only
                            “right base for a correct solution”. X pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> had referred to Geneva
                            Accords and Geneva Conference as “a” possible machinery or basis, but
                            that he seemed to be stipulating acceptance of the four points as “the”
                            (i.e., exclusive) base. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>
                            finally said there was a difference between what was required for a
                            discussion (or negotiation) and what was required for a settlement.
                            There couldn't be a settlement without recognition of the principles
                            within the four points.</p>
                        <p>9. Re “interlocuteur valable”, <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> refused to pick up references to either Ghana or
                            France; or the Commonwealth; he referred solely to <pb n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0348"/>Geneva machinery; he also claimed to be
                            confused by President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s
                            total of fifteen efforts to negotiate and the interest of some “forty”
                            countries in a settlement.<note n="4" xml:id="d113fn4">In his July 28
                                press conference, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> stated: “Fifteen efforts have been made to
                                start these discussions with the help of 40 nations throughout the
                                world, but there has been no answer.” See <ref target="#d98">Document 98</ref>.</note> X took occasion review many of these
                            orally. He observed that <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> seemed slightly discomfited by particular
                            reference to abortive Cambodian and Laotian conferences.</p>
                        <p>10. At this point, and speaking from a handwritten text,<note n="5" xml:id="d113fn5">Not further identified. </note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> said he wished to ask
                            X, “who seemed to be in position to know U.S. Government thinking”, what
                            its reaction would be to whole series of questions. X judged best to
                            reply by citing possible variation on four points which he said had been
                            written only by him but on basis his appreciation of what might be in
                            minds of his friends in Department; he again stressed this not official
                            but might help to clarify. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> took note of many of these points but X left no
                                text.<note n="6" xml:id="d113fn6">For text of Sturm's version of the
                                four points, see Herring, Secret Diplomacy of the Vietnam War, p.

                        </p>
                        <p>12. In conclusion, <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> said
                            his views were those of “Vietnamese Government” taking occasion to point
                            out X's not necessarily those of U.S. Government. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> said his policy to try to
                            insure understanding his government's views and indicated contacts with
                            X “could” be continued. When X replied he going out of town <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> asked when he would return
                            and suggested Wednesday or Thursday<note n="7" xml:id="d113fn7">August
                                11 or 12.</note> for possible next contact. He advised meeting be
                            arranged by leaving note rather than through telephone or
                            intermediaries.</p>
                        <p>13. General impression: <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>
                            is serious and appears professionally reliable contact. He aware that
                            follow-up might be pursued by persons other than X. Latter believes
                            discussions could be moved or would be moved to negotiating level, if
                            that is desired, in degree that variations on four points are introduced
                            with increasing degree of official standing.</p>
                        <p>14. Time of next meeting with <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> could be advanced but it will probably take him
                            several days to hear from his principals.<note n="8" xml:id="d113fn8">The source text bears no signature. See <ref target="#d120">Document 120</ref> for the record of the next meeting.</note>

                            <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_PFTP1">Plimpton</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName> met for one hour this afternoon
                            with non-permanent Security Council members <persName corresp="#p_RR1">Ramani</persName> (Malaysia), <persName corresp="#p_VCM1">Velazquez</persName> (Uruguay), <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Aka</persName> (Ivory Coast), Quarles (Netherlands), Scott-Murga

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RR1">Ramani</persName> opened meeting by stating
                            US letter to Security Council<note n="2" xml:id="d114fn2">See <ref target="#d99fn8">footnote 8, Document 99</ref>.</note> placed
                            obligation for action on members. Vietnam is new subject not on Security
                            Council agenda and letter cannot simply be filed. Those present
                            therefore would appreciate clarification as to US intentions and
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> explained at some length
                            rationale for President's letter to Secretary-General2 and his letter to
                            Security Council, emphasizing our central objective is to bring issue
                            out of battlefield to negotiating table, welcoming any initiatives by
                            Security Council members, collectively or individually, but expressing
                            agreement with Secretary-General's view that Security Council meeting at
                            this time would not be productive. He also stressed that our letter was
                            seriously meant, was in no sense intended as propaganda maneuver, was in
                            fulfillment our Charter obligation to keep Security Council informed,
                            was certainly not designed to put Security Council members on the spot
                            but rather to elicit from them any initiatives or assistance which may
                            lead to negotiations.</p>
                        <p>We welcome all efforts, he said, to find way to negotiations and
                            honorable settlement, including those by Quaison-Sackey, <persName corresp="#p_TM2">Tito</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SLB1">Shastri</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                            and other Africans. Most of all we count on Secretary-General and hope
                            Security Council members will assist him, as well as taking any
                            independent steps toward mediation and conciliation they may feel would
                            be constructive.</p>
                        <p>Rifai was only non-permanent member who commented at some length. He
                            recognized sincerity of US appeal to Security Council and welcomed it,
                            pointing out he had favored bringing question to Security Council in
                            April but had gotten no positive reaction then. He mentioned <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0350"/>he is meeting with Secretary-General
                            today. He would not fear polemical debate in Security Council if
                            something constructive came out of it. He would not, however, wish to go
                            into Security Council meeting without prior understanding where we would
                            come out. There is, moreover, no point in Security Council adopting
                            decision if that decision would not be accepted by interested parties
                            not present in Security Council. If these parties would not come to
                            Security Council, he believed effort should be made to obtain their
                            prior acquiescence to action Security Council would take. He hoped to
                            have further discussion among those present and with others as to what
                            should come out of a Security Council meeting, such as conditions of
                            settlement, organ that carries out settlement, etc. Without disregarding
                            outside efforts he would much prefer that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and in particular, the Security Council find solution
                            in order to strengthen future peacekeeping. He was aware US appeal to
                            Security Council had aroused interest not only of this group but of
                            other Security Council and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members. He
                            closed by saying he would like to discuss more details later.</p>
                        <p>Both <persName corresp="#p_VCM1">Velazquez</persName> and Quarles asked,
                            if no Security Council meeting were held, what other action could
                            Security Council take.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> replied that there is
                            nothing in Charter which limits Security Council action to meeting and
                            voting. Conciliation and mediation are not excluded from Security
                            Council jurisdiction. In commenting on Rifai's statement <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> said US would of course
                            welcome Security Council playing important role in solution and that is
                            why appeal to it had been made.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_VCM1">Velazquez</persName> inquired whether US,
                            having in mind Security Council should not meet on this issue, intends
                            to bring it before General Assembly. <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> replied that we still have some time before
                            General Assembly meets in which to consider that possibility but that,
                            since Security Council is organ primarily dealing with peace and
                            security it should not be downgraded by having matter prematurely taken
                            out of its hands.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Aka</persName> agreed with <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> that it is most desirable to
                            give Secretary-General time and help in finding solution before
                            resorting to Security Council meeting.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RR1">Ramani</persName> closed meeting by saying he
                            wished later to discuss other aspects of problem with <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>, having in mind special
                            Malaysian interests because of geographic proximity.</p>
                        <p>All members expressed appreciation for meeting and for <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>'s frankness.</p>
                        <p>It is our impression that these expressions were genuine and that meeting
                            was very useful even though no concrete proposals emerged.</p>

                        <p>On August 9, 1965, McGeorge Bundy sent a memorandum to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> outlining strategy
                            for <persName corresp="#p_GES1">Gullion</persName>'s (X) next meeting in
                            Paris with <persName corresp="#p_MVBR1">Mai Van Bo</persName> (R), which
                            was scheduled for August 15. The memorandum, which has not been located
                            in the holdings of the Johnson Library, is summarized in <hi rend="italic">United States-Vietnam Relations, 1945-1967</hi>:</p>

                        <p>“1. Let R do the talking this time and see if there is any give in his
                            position.</p>

                            would he suggest, recognizing the U.S. view on negotiations between
                            governments?</p>
                        <p>“d. Stress that the sole reason for the U.S. presence in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> is North Vietnamese infiltration of men
                            and supplies. If infiltration stops, the U.S. will go home. This is a
                            matter for Hanoi and no one else. Withdrawal of all forces must be the
                            product of negotiations, not the preliminary.</p>
                        <p>“e. If R brings up bombing, say that U.S. must view ‘suspension or
                            cessation in the context of adequate reciprocal actions.’</p>
                        <p>“f. Would R want conference on Vietnam alone, or Vietnam plus Laos and
                            Cambodia? How would he want the conference convened—by invitation from
                            the co-chairmen, privately, publicly, or by direct US-Vietnamese
                            means?</p>
                        <p>“g. U.S. envisages no <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> role as a right
                            in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. Is this really a precondition of

                        <p>The question of another, more extended suspension of US aerial attacks
                            against North Vietnam deserves urgent consideration. The drawbacks are
                            obvious but the advantages have perhaps not been fully explored.</p>
                        <p>If, contrary to present indications, Hanoi should, in response to some of
                            the mediation efforts now getting under way, indicate a general interest
                            in beginning negotiations in the near future, another temporary
                            suspension of US bombing might greatly facilitate the effort to get
                            negotiations started by arming one of the many possible mediators at
                            hand with convincing proof that the US desire for negotiations is
                            sincere.</p>
                        <p>The best course would probably be a decision by the United States, in
                            conjunction with a meaningful mediation effort, along the following
                            lines:</p>
                        <p>To pause in further air attacks against targets in North Vietnam for the
                            reasonable limited period of time required to support a reasonable
                            mediation effort to determine whether the North Vietnamese authorities
                            are prepared to enter into unconditional negotiations for a peaceful
                            settlement. If there were no appreciable progress within a limited time,
                            we would resume bombing. We would, of course, exclude an open-ended
                            commitment to halt bombing indefinitely, as long as negotiations
                            continued; we must avoid repeating our experience in Korea in this
                            regard.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Action in Response to an Appeal.</hi> We could make
                            a declaration of this character in response to an appeal by one of the
                            world leaders now considering Viet Nam initiatives (e.g., the Secretary
                            General, <persName corresp="#p_TM2">Tito</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SLB1">Shastri</persName> or, less desirably, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>). The action taken would be separate and
                            distinct from a possible briefer pause in bombing during a four-day
                            visit to Hanoi by <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>;
                            Quaison-Sackey mentioned the four-day period to me on Saturday
                                morning.<note n="2" xml:id="d116fn2">August 7.</note>

                        <p>If we are to share the credit with anyone (i.e., by responding to an
                            appeal), the best choice would be the Secretary General. He has urged on
                            us previously an appeal for a cessation of hostilities; by responding to
                            an appeal from him, we would thereby reaffirm our support of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and tend to keep it in the picture. It
                            would be a logical follow up to your letter of July 28 asking the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> to play a role.<note n="3" xml:id="d116fn3">See <ref target="#d99fn8">footnote 8, Document
                                    99</ref>.</note> It would arm him with the means to probe the
                            other side. This would facilitate a subsequent move on our part to
                            involve the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in the role of supervising
                            or policing a negotiated settlement. Rejection by Hanoi of an appeal
                            from the Secretary General would do more damage to the Communists'
                            international position than would their rejection of a unilateral US
                            declaration.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Private Message.</hi> An alternative to responding
                            to an outside appeal would be a private message to Hanoi indicating that
                            we would stop bombing for a reasonable period if it is prepared to enter
                            into unconditional negotiations for a peaceful settlement. While a
                            private message would deprive us at the outset of public credit for an
                            important peace initiative, our initiative would ultimately become
                            public knowledge, whether or not it had succeeded. Hanoi might find it
                            easier to respond affirmatively to such a private message than to an
                            appeal from, say, the Secretary General. It would not require Hanoi to
                            respond publicly—and any public response would entail Hanoi's eating a
                            certain amount of crow in the eyes of its domestic and foreign
                            audiences; rather, it could respond through private, concrete actions
                            which would demonstrate its desire to move toward negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Whether it is decided to implement a limited pause in air strikes through
                            a third-party intermediary or a direct private message to Hanoi, it will
                            be necessary to emphasize the following points:</p>
                        <p>That the pause is a genuine effort to facilitate negotiations and reduce
                            the dangers of escalation;</p>
                        <p>That a response must come from Hanoi within a reasonable time;</p>
                        <p>That we are ready to discuss a general cease-fire involving mutual
                            concessions as a first item in the negotiations;</p>
                        <p>But that we are serious in our intention to resume the aerial attacks if
                            there is no forthcoming response from Hanoi.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Moyers</persName> opened the discussion
                            by reviewing previous meetings on Viet-Nam information problems.<note n="2" xml:id="d117fn2">See <ref target="#d105">Document

                            priority and wants to do what is right. He noted that Barry Zorthian
                            will be given a new position in the Embassy with responsibility for
                            press and information matters, thus removing <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> from the direct line of authority over military news
                            in Viet-Nam.<note n="3" xml:id="d117fn3">In a telephone conversation
                                with Rusk on August 9, <persName corresp="#p_CJA1">Califano</persName> indicated that the President wanted to make

                                Special Assistant for Public Affairs, and bring under him anyone
                                dealing with public affairs in Vietnam. The President's idea was to
                                have <persName corresp="#p_ZB1">Zorthian</persName> put out all the
                                news. He felt that this would increase <persName corresp="#p_ZB1">Zorthian</persName>'s prestige with the public and the press,
                                and make him the <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill Moyers</persName>

                            practical things that could be done to improve public understanding of
                            events in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GJL1">Greenfield</persName> said that the news
                            reports of U.S. soldiers setting fire to Vietnamese villages and related
                            incidents are causing very serious problems here and abroad. We have to
                            recognize that there exists a double standard, that such incidents are
                            considered more serious if Americans, rather than South Vietnamese, are
                            responsible. In view of the extensive press and media coverage in
                            Viet-Nam stories and pictures like these will continue to appear as long
                            as the incidents occur. Alleged <pb n="323" xml:id="pg_323" facs="0355"/>maltreatment of Vietnamese civilians and civilian facilities is a
                            moral and humanitarian concern for many Americans. We must recognize
                            this as a serious, long-run problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJ1">Chancellor</persName> referred to previous
                            meetings in which the importance of making the American people aware of
                            the changing character of war was stressed. The new kind of “twilight”
                            war we are fighting in Viet-Nam requires more maturity, sophistication,
                            and patience from the American people than previous wars. He said we
                            need to find ways to build the necessary understanding of our
                            involvement in Viet-Nam, an involvement that may well be repeated
                            elsewhere in the years to come. Simple aggressive patriotism wasn't
                            enough. You can't just “kill Japs” in a war like this one. We should
                            work on editors and other opinion-influencers to show them that the
                            habits of mind left over from World War II and Korea are not adequate
                            for understanding this war.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Sylvester</persName> stressed the problem
                            of unfriendly correspondents in Viet-Nam, particularly foreigners,
                            including some who work for U.S. news agencies and media. Some of these
                            individuals are known to be less than fully sympathetic with our efforts
                            and appear to miss no chance to embarrass us. The present concern about
                            the village burned near Da Nang arose largely out of a CBS-TV film made
                            and narrated by Morley Safer, a Canadian subject. The incident depicted
                            in the film was not typical, so even if it was not staged (a possibility
                            he did not rule out) it was a distortion since it conveyed an inaccurate
                            impression. He noted that some reporters fail to tell the full story
                            when they depict U.S. forces in action. They don't give equal time to
                            the facts of Viet Cong atrocities, and they fail to point out that
                            villages burned are Viet Cong strongholds, and that “civilians” who
                            appear to be maltreated are Viet Cong personnel who may have killed U.S.
                            or <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Sylvester</persName> also said he thought
                            it was important to take steps to inform our personnel of the press
                            problem stemming from such pictures and stories, so that they don't lend
                            themselves to this kind of coverage in the course of carrying out their
                            missions. He said there was a need to provide better information
                            officers in Viet-Nam. As one step in that direction he was considering
                            sending his Special Assistant for Viet-Nam Col. Rodger Bankson as
                            over-all coordinator of military information, with rank of Brigadier
                            General.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GJL1">Greenfield</persName> said we couldn't
                            pull a curtain on the problem. There were too many reporters covering
                            this war. It isn't just a problem of a few bad apples. We have to get
                            used to fighting in the open. This is a new kind of war, a war in which
                            the basic goal is people, not territory. You can't win the people in
                            Viet-Nam by burning their villages. This may have worked at Iwo Jima,
                            but it won't work in Viet-Nam. We have to take steps to prevent these
                            things from happening, not just to make sure reporters don't see
                            them.</p>
                        <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0356"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLC1">Meeker</persName> said the International
                            Committee of the Red Cross was about to enter the picture. The Secretary
                            of State and the Vietnamese Government were about to send letters
                            indicating that the United States and South Viet-Nam would cooperate
                            with the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> will want to take an active role in
                            Viet-Nam. Therefore we should:</p>
                        <p>1. Instruct our troops in the field to conduct themselves in conformity
                            with the Geneva convention and accepted standards of warfare (without
                            hampering their efforts to prosecute the war); and</p>
                        <p>2. Publicly demonstrate our concern that the rules of war be observed in
                            Viet-Nam. This should be accomplished by publicizing our willingness to
                            cooperate with the Red Cross, and the Viet Cong-North Viet-Nam
                            unwillingness to do likewise. We should call on the other side to mark
                            their hospitals, permit inspection of prison camps, etc. We should also
                            publicize directives and guidelines given to our troops in the
                            field.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCL1">Cooper</persName> said we were dealing
                            with a deeply important problem that goes beyond public relations. At
                            issue here is how the war should be fought. We should examine carefully
                            the usefulness of such actions as bombing raids by the <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> and our own planes against Vietnamese
                            villages. Our object is not so much to destroy an enemy as to win a
                            people. We must make sure our military operations are in fact
                            productive. If burning a village provides the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> with a hundred additional recruits then that action is
                            counterproductive in basic military terms. He agreed that this is a
                            difficult war to fight, but that is no reason not to deal with these
                            incidents as a problem in and of themselves.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCL1">Cooper</persName> also asked about the
                            Vietnamese interpreters who assist U.S. and foreign correspondents. Is
                            there any way of checking to make sure they aren't slanting their advice
                            in favor of the Viet Cong. Could the Ministry of Information run careful
                            checks on these interpreters?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZB1">Zorthian</persName> said the interpreters
                            were accredited by <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> after a check
                            by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, but such procedures don't
                            mean much in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Moyers</persName> said he was considering
                            meeting with the heads of the major wire services, to discuss the nature
                            of the war and ask for a balanced view of it. We would suggest that they
                            assign better, more mature reporters, preferably U.S. nationals. Such an
                            approach had obvious risks but was worth considering. It might also be
                            worth approaching editors and columnists in a similar vein. He hoped the
                            series of backgrounders for editors and top media people Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> was undertaking in
                            major cities at the President's request would help.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZB1">Zorthian</persName> said better military
                            information personnel were essential. He hoped the marines would get a
                            good one not just someone who saw his job as promoting the leatherneck
                            image. As for the village burning problem, it might be best to have
                            orders issued that no villages should be attacked except under very
                            exceptional circumstances. Also, <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0357"/>better Vietnamese liaison personnel should be attached to U.S. units
                            in the field.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZB1">Zorthian</persName> raised the question of
                            censorship. The present system of voluntary cooperation is working
                            fairly well. But some high officials favor full field censorship.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GJL1">Greenfield</persName> pointed out that no
                            system of censorship would prevent stories like the village burning or
                            the CBS-TV film. Censorship dealt with questions of military security,
                            not public relations. He suspected some of those who favor censorship
                            saw it as a way to prevent these inconvenient stories. But it would not
                            work that way.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Moyers</persName> asked that memoranda be
                            prepared for the President setting forth what should be done in Saigon
                            and in Washington that we are not now doing to deal with these problems.

                        <p>2. He opposes “dribbling” forces into Viet Nam little by little and
                            favors using adequate forces at once to do the job. He opposes American

                            He approves development of strong points along the coast. He wants no
                            formal announcements of total U.S. troop strength. Such announcements
                            give the Viet Cong a pretext to raise their demands on Hanoi, Peking and
                            Moscow. I understand all the above has been conveyed to you already by

                            We should do everything to inculcate such a desire. They must have
                            “heart” or, after we have achieved a successful outcome, they will slump
                            right back. It would be tragic if a successful outcome were followed by
                            an election in which the people voted for the Viet Cong. I told him our
                            plans regarding Lansdale were aimed precisely at such a contingency. <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0358"/>He suggested a scheme whereby

                            position of U.S. Government leaders. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> had indeed reflected and wished to know “what

                            position, as per earlier report. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> then stated that <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName>'s version did not constitute the basis for a correct

                        <p>3. At this point (and at least three times thereafter) <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> tried to pin <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> down on whether Hanoi's
                            points had to be accepted in toto before conference could be convened.
                                <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> was more negative
                            than at previous meeting. He assured <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> that his principals understood point U.S. trying to

                            not be brought to say categorically one thing or the other with respect
                            to whether or to what extent substance of Hanoi's points had to be
                            stipulated or accepted in advance of the meeting.</p>

                            should be convened sooner or later depended upon the Americans. X
                            replied that his friends also thought a conference of the Geneva type
                            was desirable if it could be held without pre-conditions. Such a

                            that Sihanouk had altered his attitude ending with willingness to see

                            <note n="5" xml:id="d120fn5">In his July 28 press conference, President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> stated that the
                                Viet Cong “would have no difficulty being represented” in
                                negotiations “if Hanoi for a moment decides she wants to cease

                            was up to U.S. to give concrete details. <gloss target="#t_FNL1">FNL</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> said,

                            observed that Saigon also had carried on fight for twenty years, its
                            soldiers now fighting and dying, and hundred of thousands of refugees
                            were fleeing Hanoi-controlled regions. Discussion on this point,
                            however, said <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName>, was sterile.

                            themselves task of exploring possibility of convening useful meeting.
                            What for example, were obstacles which <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> saw to such a meeting?</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> again signally failed
                            to cite U.S. bombing as an obstacle; he did say that U.S. must leave
                            Vietnam alone to work out its destiny without interference; claimed that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> recently said
                            U.S. must remain in Vietnam and could never leave it, which <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> vigorously denied. In response
                                <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>'s query what U.S.
                            objectives in Vietnam were, <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName>
                            emphasized again that they were those stipulated in Geneva Accords. He
                            also cited his version of Hanoi's four points, particularly numbers
                            three and four, to stress U.S. desire to see self-determination and
                            unification of Vietnam; he emphasized that if there were no North
                            Vietnamese troops or arms in Hanoi U.S. ready to put its policies to the
                                <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0362"/>test (i.e.,
                            self-determination by Vietnamese and possible non-alignment), and would
                            be ready to begin withdrawals. He said these would have to be phased and
                            balanced with pullback of North Vietnamese. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> indicated agreement with idea
                            of balance and verification. He asked if this was what <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> had meant by “redeploiement” in his
                            version of four points. He then claimed that “these accusations” of
                            North Vietnamese activity in Vietnam were only recent whereas U.S. had
                            begun to sabotage the situation as far back as '54 with the Ngo Dinh
                            Diem operation and sending advisers. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> replied that there were other forms of interference,
                            including intimidation, subversion, terrorism, Chinese influence. To
                            latter <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> countered that
                            Vietnam had defended its independence for thousands of years and
                                <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> need not worry.</p>
                        <p>7. At this point <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> remarked
                            discussion so far provided little prospect for constructive work. He
                            reviewed his understanding of <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>'s position, which he said was apparently more
                            negative than previously. He reiterated that his friends in U.S. would
                            be ready for Geneva-type conference which would certainly take Pham van
                            Dong's program as point of departure; provided this conference were
                            without pre-condition or ultimata. After all we were not in position of
                            French after Dien Bien Phu and in fact possessed fantastic strength we
                            hoped not to use. Hanoi surely could not expect U.S. to accept a
                            conference which stipulated prior acceptance of its points, or which was
                            to be preceded by U.S. troop withdrawals or which obliged us to desert
                            our allies by setting up <gloss target="#t_FNL1">FNL</gloss> as sole
                            negotiator. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> thought his version
                            of four points if picked up by U.S., as it well might be, represented a
                            very forthcoming effort. He asked again whether <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> had carefully noted these and
                            whether they had been under study (mis a l'etude). <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> confirmed that they had.</p>
                        <p>8. At this point <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>
                            meaningfully asked whether <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> had

                                afternoon of August 13. In its August 14 issue, The New York Times
                                carried an article datelined Paris, August 13, stating that the
                                interview was published “today in Le Monde.” The text of the
                                interview was broadcast in English over Hanoi radio on August 15.

                            possible for him to have done so since paper was only just reaching
                            subscribers at time of interview. It is possibly significant that
                                <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> had seen <persName corresp="#p_DP1">Devillers</persName> shortly before leaving U.S.)

                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> asked if it might not be
                            possible for <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> and him to
                            come to grips with semantics and problem of agenda by envisioning terms
                            in which an initiative on conference might be announced, e.g., “… in
                            order to secure and preserve fundamental right of Vietnamese people,
                            etc., as affirmed in Geneva Accords a meeting of Geneva conferees to be
                            held which would take up Pham Van Dong's four points and other
                            propositions.” <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> nodded
                            agreement to first part of phrase, disagreement to its ending.</p>
                        <p>10. Finally, <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> professed himself
                            discouraged and puzzled at <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>'s greater rigidity. He hoped history would not
                            record that he and <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> had
                            failed in their duty to seize present opportunity. Said he was not
                            offering any threats but begged Rupert to reflect on devastation which
                            might be unleashed if war escalated. No one who had not seen U.S. power
                            could imagine its full potential. To avert this his friends in U.S.
                            earnestly desired to move the confrontation from the battlefield to the
                            diplomatic table.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> said he must now begin to
                            doubt utility of continuing conversations but probably should be one
                            more contact before he obliged to return home. In one of very few
                            positive developments <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>
                            was eager to have a further meeting in case he said there should be
                            “some change in the points of confrontation”. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> said he must return home Tuesday or Wednesday.<note n="7" xml:id="d120fn7">August 17 or 18.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> is moving out of his
                            flat but said he would inform <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName>
                            where next meeting should be held.</p>
                        <p>12. General impressions and recommendations:</p>
                        <p>(a) Despite negative atmosphere, it could be that stiffening of <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>'s attitude was the obvious
                            thing for him to do tactically. Also whole meeting was held under shadow
                            of <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName>'s declaration.</p>
                        <p>(b) <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> believes he went about as far
                            as it is possible to go, without giving impression of U.S. weakness, in
                            exhibiting U.S. readiness to negotiate under various formulae and in
                            various combinations. He established beyond doubt that the alternate
                            version of Hanoi's four points had been studied and rejected by Hanoi.
                            It is still too early to say, however, that this rejection is final.</p>
                        <p>(c) Points on which there seem to be some flexibility on part of Hanoi
                            are with respect to troop withdrawals and <gloss target="#t_FNL1">FNL</gloss> representation. (<persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName>
                            believes <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> himself would
                            envision ancillary negotiating role for <gloss target="#t_FNL1">FNL</gloss>; he inquired how U.S. had dealt with Red China at
                            international conferences.) Less flexibility than before shown on agenda
                            for conference but this may reflect impact of <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName>'s declaration.</p>
                        <p>(d) Before next meeting may be desirable to have: (1) statement of
                                <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName>'s friends' position on
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho</persName>'s declaration, especially
                            in relation to <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>
                            <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0364"/>talks; (2) any further version
                            of four points; (3) a brief formulation <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> might use as his suggestion along lines of 9 above.
                            This would have virtue of eliminating semantic confusion as source of
                            division, smoking out Viets and making the record of U.S. attitude

                        <p>505. For the President.</p>
                        <p>1. Probably the most important political development of the week was an
                            interview with Buddhist bonze, <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri
                                Quang</persName>, in a Hong Kong paper denouncing the Directory
                            government in general and General <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName> in particular. On the military front, the most
                            notable development was that the <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>
                            estimate of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> losses (1,330 killed in
                            action) was the highest since the war began here.</p>
                        <p>2. The Hong Kong Far Eastern Economic Review interview with <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> quoted him as having said “the
                            people” were against the government and he was also against the
                            government, as well as saying that he hoped the war could be stopped as
                            soon as possible by a cease fire or “by any negotiations which would
                            have the peoples' support”. He was also quoted as saying that a small
                            country like Vietnam could rely only on itself and “certainly on no
                            outsider”. <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> may claim to
                            have been misquoted as he did following an earlier interview with the
                            same correspondent, but the sentiments attributed to him with respect to
                            the government are consistent with what he has recently been telling
                            Embassy officers. It is harder to interpret his enigmatic remarks with
                            respect to the war. Not many weeks ago, he was privately telling
                            visitors that we should pursue the war more vigorously, bombing the
                            north harder and even taking on the Chinese Communists. Thus, I do not
                            think that we <pb n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0365"/>should conclude
                            that he is swinging toward “neutralism”, that is, negotiations with the
                            Liberation Front for a coalition government. It is also too early to say
                            what form his opposition to the government may take. A few days ago, he
                            told us that he had discouraged the forming of demonstrations in Hue
                            having anti-government character.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> and his party took off for
                            Taipei early Sunday morning,<note n="2" xml:id="d121fn2">August
                                15.</note> will be going directly from there to Bangkok, and
                            returning here next Saturday or Sunday. I had a good talk with him
                            before he left, both on his trip and some other matters including the
                                “<persName corresp="#p_Chieu1">Chieu Hoi</persName>” program,
                            treatment of prisoners taken in combat and land reform. I do not feel
                            that the substance of what he does in Taipei will cause us any problem
                            but, given his propensity for flamboyant statements, I will not make the
                            same prediction for what he says publicly.</p>
                        <p>4. Our people in the field feel that there has been some improvement in
                            popular attitudes as a result of the recent military successes and that
                            popular aversion to the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> continues
                            somewhat to increase although this does not necessarily translate itself
                            into active commitment to or support for the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. On the military side, not only were the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> losses highest ever but the ratio to friendly troops
                            killed (214) was a little better than six to one. The other indicators
                            were also good with more <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> weapons captured than government troops
                            missing in action and government weapons lost. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> also continued to avoid initiating any
                            actions by major units although they kept up their heavy harassment of
                            villages and outposts. The government made a little progress in clearing
                            lines of communication.</p>
                        <p>6. On the economic side, negotiations with the government on the US
                            currency “black mart” problem made good progress, and we hope that we
                            can have this tied up in the next few days. The rice imports from
                            Thailand appear to have met our immediate needs and should hold the
                            situation until the arrival of additional <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 rice.<note n="3" xml:id="d121fn3">On a copy of this

                            stressed desirability further meeting. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> believes necessary he return at this time to inventory
                            talks in relation to developments and other indices Hanoi attitudes and
                            discuss next steps.</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> telephoned yesterday
                            to fix today's meeting. At previous session he had indicated utility of
                            talks and said that even if <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> were
                            to leave now but “should pass again through Paris” it would be useful to
                            consult.</p>
                        <p>2. He opened by asking whether <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> had
                            studied <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName>'s
                            declaration. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> desired
                            clarification on number of points. First was date of <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_DP1">Devillers</persName> interview which he assumed was on basis
                            written questions. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>
                            confirmed and said date was to be taken as that of appearance in Le
                            Monde (i.e., August 14) and that answers “had only arrived from Hanoi
                            evening before”. (<persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> believes his
                            friends correct in assuming interview was planted answer to him, which
                            also implies indeterminate amount of French help in stage managing.)
                                <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> said he discouraged by
                            negative tone of statements and <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> jested that <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> always seemed discouraged.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> noted that neither questions
                            nor replies had made any reference to statement accompanying original
                            four points re “most correct basis for political solution”.<note n="4" xml:id="d122fn4">For text, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign

                            uneasiness <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> asserted
                            Hanoi position still the same. He then linked “recognition of this
                            basis” to “tangible proofs” required by <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho
                                Chi Minh</persName> in latest declaration. These, he said, included
                            in the first instance a suspension of bombing but he also referred to
                            withdrawal of troops and halting U.S. “aggression”. (Re latter term
                                <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> indicated that it would be
                            better in these discussions if terms like “enemy”, “aggression”, etc.,
                            were abjured.) <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>
                            expatiated at some <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0367"/>length on
                            the bombing and worldwide condemnation of it. (<persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> got some impression <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> being hurt.) Promising to return
                            to this point, <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName>

                                it.</note> proceeded to review <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho</persName> declaration from beginning.</p>
                        <p>4. Re point number one, <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>
                            was less categoric than <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho</persName>. He
                            claimed that “realistically” only FLN, which was carrying on fight, was
                            suited to speak for South. Whole world knew it was representative but
                            Saigon was not. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> disagreed and
                            said it was “not realistic” to expect the most powerful nation in the
                            world to go into negotiations at price of abandoning allies, accepting
                            Hanoi fiat on agenda, and pulling all its troops out. In subsequent
                            discussion <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> got strong impression
                                <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> and even Hanoi
                            ready to accept some other formula for <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> representation but wishes to prod U.S. into putting it
                            forward. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> alleged France
                            had finally been obliged to accept FLN as sole negotiating agent in
                            Algeria. He did not knock down idea that agreement on formula for
                            representation could be accepted if other obstacles were removed. He did
                            ask just what formula U.S. would imagine. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> referred to previous statements of U.S.
                            Government leaders.</p>
                        <p>5. Re second question of <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho</persName>
                            declaration, <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> judges significant
                                <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>'s confirmation that
                            unification could wait quite some time. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> insisted this depended on will of the people and asked
                            what <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho</persName> meant by mention of
                            program of front in this connection. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> said FLN recognized that unification would come
                            “by stages” and on basis of popular consultation. Hanoi agreed.
                                <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> insisted on word
                            “stages”. He even said that “there might be people in the south” (or
                            just people) “who might not want unification” and in this case “Hanoi
                            prepared to wait” until they did! Re mechanism for controlling
                            elections, supervision, etc., <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> made no substantive objection to hypothetical
                            projections made by <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName>.</p>
                        <p>6. Re point three, <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> asked what
                                <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> considered “proofs”
                            to be. When latter again came forth with cessation of bombing <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>
                            <note n="6" xml:id="d122fn6">“?<persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName>”
                                is written in hand before “Rupert.”</note> replied in preconceived
                            terms that such a gesture had been made once before with no result or
                            counterpart. It was conceivable that such a gesture might be repeated
                            but it was not conceivable that it could be unilateral. Surely <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> could not expect the U.S. in
                            Saigon or the Saigon Government to negotiate under terrorism and while
                            325th Division roamed the country. Terrorist acts only weakened Hanoi's
                            case with those who might be disposed to sympathize. Since <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> said he and <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> agreed to place their
                            discussions under “sign of realism” it surely was “unrealistic” to
                            pretend that Hanoi did not have units in the country. (Whereat <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> laughed heartily.) <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> then became very serious,
                            appeared on the point of making a reply but decided to withhold it. It
                            was entirely obvious that suspension of bombing has now re-emerged as
                            key objective <pb n="336" xml:id="pg_336" facs="0368"/>of Viets (as also
                            confirmed in Para 10 infra). <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> showed <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> an
                            extract with a Washington byline from a French press digest7 to effect
                            that Department of State spokesman had said that contacts with Hanoi had
                            turned up nothing significant and then referring to an Aide-Memoire
                            Department was supposed to have circulated to a number of governments
                            explaining terms on which U.S. would again suspend bombing.<note n="7" xml:id="d122fn7">Not further identified.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> asked if <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> knew of such a memorandum. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> said he had heard something along lines
                            of first part of release but not informed of any memo. Hazarded guess
                            that if indeed it existed, which he questioned, it might be along lines
                            he, <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName>, had employed.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> asked whether it was correct to
                            understand that <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho</persName> was calling
                            for prior withdrawal of U.S. troops in same time scale as suspension of
                            bombing and as prerequisite to discussions. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> again laughed, said that was
                            not “realistic” and that of course he recognized that withdrawals would
                            have to be phased. It should, however, be stipulated that final
                            settlement should see withdrawals completed. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> indicated that they should also be balanced, i.e.,
                            against pullback of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> troops (whose
                            presence in South Vietnam <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> no longer denies). <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> insisted in his interpretation of Hanoi policy
                            despite fact <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> pointed out it
                            seemed at variance with <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho</persName>
                            interview.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> took occasion presented by
                                <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>'s insistence on
                            “poor show” by South Vietnamese troops again to stress futility of
                            Hanoi's hope to force a decision; he remarked on differences between
                            French military posture and that of U.S., said all <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> might achieve would be escalation of
                            war, which could only be to its disadvantage, involving foreign
                            influence in north and south, devastation of North Vietnam, and
                            undesirable hatred between Americans and Vietnamese. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> said that in war it was
                            necessary to envision the worst and that the consequences of escalation,
                            including external intervention, had been foreseen and prepared for.
                                (<persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName>'s purpose was to draw out
                                <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> on possible
                            evolution of conflict and again to impress him that U.S. not speaking
                            from weakness.)</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> what he preferred or
                            suggested as channel of contact with Hanoi. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> said all the same provided
                            responsible people speak, whether it was in “Paris, Peking, Moscow, or
                            Hanoi”. Then said that since <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> had
                            obtained clarification Hanoi position he now wished clarifications from
                                <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName>. Latter recalled that in
                                <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>'s own words
                                <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> represented his
                            government, <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> only the opinion of
                            some of his friends in government.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> then took up
                                <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName>'s earlier suggested four
                            points with striking total recall (?) of verbal presentation. His most
                            important observation <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337" facs="0369"/>was on
                            point one: The basic rights of Vietnamese people to peace, etc., are
                            recognized as set forth in the Geneva Accords, etc. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> verified French translation
                            of this sentence and then said that point now was to give “tangible
                            proof” that these rights were recognized. Such proof he said might be a
                            cessation of bombardments.</p>
                        <p>11. Some other points of translation raised were: Line four (<persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName>'s text, not given to <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>), “compliance” to which
                                <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> preferred
                            “acceptance” and “execution” to “acquiescement”. Line nine, what was
                            “quasi-military” and did it apply to personnel or weapons or both?
                                <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> assumed this meant persons
                            carrying out military functions, suppletifs and partisans, not
                            necessarily regulars. Presumably a truck or aircraft could also be
                            quasi-military. Line 13, “regrouping and redeployment”. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> said these almost the same thing, one
                            word perhaps more static than the other. Separation of combatants at
                            some stage should be envisaged. In reply <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>'s question re “indigenous” and “foreign
                            personnel”, <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> assumed indigenous
                            would mean all types of Vietnamese forces. This might include tribal
                            groups as well as Vietnamese. What then was meant by “foreign
                            personnel”? Just what it said, replied <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName>. Of course if <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> had
                            performed miracles in training indigenous forces to operate missiles
                            they might not be involved in pullback. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> thought this a great joke and said “you mean if
                            they were Soviets they should leave”? Yes, said <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName>, and Chinese, etc.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> convinced foregoing had
                            sufficient substance and implication to warrant further contacts. He
                            convinced, however, he should at this point return home to touch base,
                            make sure he does not get out of line, assess possible follow-up, and to
                            discuss means of improving security, contacts, communications, etc. Also
                            desirable to let <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>
                            marinate. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> he leaving over weekend and
                            would give him date of departure. Also exchanged addresses, telephone
                            numbers, and means of contact. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName>
                            set up possibility of return in case he had to “confer further
                            concerning his university connection in Geneva”.</p>

                        <p>1. The President laid great stress on the importance of intelligence in
                            South Viet-Nam. Mr. Bundy commented that this was in part a matter of
                            specific actions, but also heavily related to the general improvement in
                            popular morale and cohesion which was the objective of Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and of the Lansdale
                            group.</p>
                        <p>2. The President commented at some length on the state of public opinion
                            in the United States concerning the Viet-Nam problem. He hoped that all
                            officers of the Department could be as active as possible in getting the
                            Administration point of view fully expressed in public forums, and also
                            in dealing with critical segments of the press such as the New York
                            Times and, occasionally, the “Kennedy columnists.” The President
                            expressed the general view that public support for Administration
                            policies was generally satisfactory at present, but that this would
                            become more doubtful if the conflict were prolonged another year or
                            more. For this reason, but above all for the overriding reason of its
                            own importance he stressed over and over again that the Department was
                            the agency responsible for finding a proper way to peace. He had several
                            exchanges with the Secretary and with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> on the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and other efforts in progress, and made abundantly clear
                            his whole-hearted support for these efforts.</p>
                        <p>3. In connection with the Viet-Nam problem, but also more broadly, the
                            President also laid great stress on the importance of relationships with
                            Congress. He particularly underlined the vital necessity of advance
                            consultation with Congressional leaders and interested committees on all
                            actions being contemplated by the Department.</p>

                            negotiations:</p>
                        <p>1. Although the U Thant proposal is as unfair as one would expect, there
                            is advantage in handling it very carefully—not because it will lead to
                            an end to the aggression in Vietnam, but because news of it will leak
                            and the U.S. Government must appear in a good light in the minds of
                            those who think that peace can be promoted in this manner.</p>
                        <p>2. Convincing these people that the U.S. Government is leaving no stone
                            unturned has undoubtedly been a big factor in the remarkable education
                            of U.S. opinion in the last six months under the President's leadership.
                            Today, practically every American of good will understands why Vietnam
                            is important and therefore why we must be here.</p>
                        <p>3. This is of the greatest importance in our effort to ward off the
                            aggression here. In fact, a unified and determined U.S. opinion is the
                            decisive ingredient. It also creates favorable opinion abroad.</p>
                        <p>4. But there is another aspect which gives me pause. I believe we are
                            approaching the point when further public eagerness by US for
                            “negotiations” will harden Hanoi and Peking's resolve and convince them
                            that we are weak internally (however strong we may be at Chu Lai) thus
                            making things harder for our soldiers, tending to prolong the conflict,
                            and sapping the will to win of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. The President's bombing decision stopped the argument in Saigon as to
                            whether to continue the war and it started the discussion on how best to
                            win it. The President's decision on troops has brought a conviction that
                            the U.S. is not clock-watching and is determined to see this thing
                            through. In Vietnamese minds, this makes a successful outcome
                            inevitable. These are precious assets which must be conserved and
                            cherished and certainly not diluted or destroyed.</p>
                        <pb n="340" xml:id="pg_340" facs="0372"/>
                        <p>6. The above in no way means that we should not work hard for peace, but
                            what is needed for peace at this moment is a conviction in the minds of
                            the enemy that its aggression is doomed to failure.</p>
                        <p>7. It would be helpful here and would have a constructive effect on U.S.
                            and foreign opinion, and ultimately in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, if we gave great prominence to the fact that our effort
                            in Vietnam is being undertaken in the letter and spirit of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter which states in Article I that
                            the member states shall “take effective collective measures for the
                            prevention and removal of threats to the peace and for suppression of
                            acts of aggression… .” This is precisely what we are doing. Our effort
                            is thus noble, respectable and legal in the highest sense. It should be
                            made to appear so and not look like a unilateral American adventure. I
                            have only seen one excellent statement by the President at a press
                            conference concerning the aggression aspect. Could not more be done
                            along this line?</p>
                        <p>8. It is for this reason that I question the wisdom of paragraph 8 of the
                            proposed aide-memoire (<gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>). To
                            talk about “a cessation of all hostile military activity by all
                            concerned” implies that we and the South Vietnamese on the one hand are
                            in the same moral position as Hanoi and Peking on the other. This is not
                            the case. Hanoi and Peking wish to dominate South Vietnam. South Vietnam
                            and the U.S. do not wish to dominate North Vietnam. Hanoi and Peking are
                            the aggressors. South Vietnam is the aggrieved party. We must not give
                            the impression that it is “six of one and a half-dozen of the
                            other”.</p>
                        <p>9. I also fear the effect when paragraph 9 becomes public.</p>
                        <p>10. And the words “cease fire” make many hairs stand on end in Saigon and
                            could give rise to widespread feeling that the “Americans are
                            negotiating behind our backs and therefore why should we fight any
                            more?”</p>
                        <p>11. I recognize the difficulty of these decisions and that there is much
                            to be said for a sympathetic attitude toward U Thant's proposals. I also
                            recognize the commitment which we have already made for the record. But
                            there are other factors and a constructive contribution could be made to
                            public thinking by reminding members of the UN and public opinion
                            generally of Article I of the Charter.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. We believe a main element of Communist strength in North and South
                            Vietnam has been their complete confidence in ultimate victory according
                            to their strategic plan. <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> morale in
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> depends in large measure upon
                            things going as planned. Superiority of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> over the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> and
                            sure victory is the backbone of troop indoctrination.</p>
                        <p>2. Indications are that when Hanoi saw in early 1964 that the U.S. had
                            decided to step up assistance to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>,
                            decision was made to move more rapidly toward victory through increased
                            organized military action in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. With
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> political system in disarray,
                            the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> remained the hard core upon
                            which the U.S. could build. Disintegration of the armed forces through
                            multiple large-scale assaults could remove the last stumbling block to
                            decisive control of the country. The rapid build up of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> with organized <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> units and augmentation of support activities and
                            political cadres began.</p>
                        <p>3. Hanoi has received two strategic surprises since initiating what was
                            intended as the final phase. First, the U.S. has introduced, and is
                            continuing to build up, air and ground forces in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> on a scale that Hanoi must never have anticipated. The
                            second surprise was the air campaign against <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. The impact of U.S. forces in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> has
                            upset <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> timing. Obvious intentions to
                            embark upon a campaign of large scale attacks materialized in Feb. In
                            their efforts to make 1965 a year of decision, the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have made some limited gains but at a
                            high price. Since March 1965 they have suffered heavy losses in
                            virtually all of their major military efforts. This trend has been
                            particularly pronounced since May when Viet Cong initiated large-scale
                            operations such as those fought at Song Be, Dong Xoai, and Duc Co which
                            cost the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> very heavy and probably
                            unanticipated casualties. The introduction of expanded U.S. air and
                            ground forces and naval support have further compounded the Viet Cong
                            problem as illustrated by the dramatic U.S. operation on the Van Tuong
                            peninsula, south of Chu Lai, where U.S. Marines destroyed the 1st <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> regiment. Employment of U.S. forces in
                            the highlands hear Pleiku can and will disrupt <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> plans for seizure and control of that strategic area.
                            Following Chu Lai <pb n="342" xml:id="pg_342" facs="0374"/>more ground
                            forces will be introduced when the 1st Cavalry Division lands. Hanoi
                            knows that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> division and other
                            U.S. forces will soon be introduced. Employment of B-52's and scheduled
                            deployment of additional U.S. air squadrons will further emphasize U.S.
                            intent. More prisoners are being taken now. More defections are
                            occurring. These rates will rise when augmented U.S. air and ground
                            forces are brought more fully to bear in harassment, attrition, and
                            search and destroy missions.</p>
                        <p>5. The evidence is now overwhelming that the Communist forces in both
                            Vietnams are all under the command of Hanoi, and the battlefield in
                            North Vietnam can be regarded as the support area or zone of interior.
                            After the first surprise of air attack in <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>, against what must have been regarded as a sanctuary,
                            Hanoi probably expected world opinion to cause the U.S. to limit
                            operations to sporadic, punitive attacks if not stop them completely. We
                            have just reviewed our program, Ref A, we are now at a point where we
                            can move toward the effective disruption of the current <gloss target="#t_RT1">RT</gloss> area. This will make it extremely
                            difficult for Hanoi to continue support to forces in Laos and <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. But the important thing now is to keep
                            the Communists psychologically off balance. We believe the process is
                            well underway in the <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> portion of the
                            battlefield. In the north we must concentrate upon the same objective.
                            Communist belief in victory must be destroyed. They are now taking
                            comfort from greater air defense capability and there are some
                            indications that use of the <gloss target="#t_IL281">IL-28</gloss>'s and
                                <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>'s may be contemplated. We may
                            expect some dramatic effort as their need for a morale boost grows. We
                            must not allow their developing capabilities to generate hope of turning
                            the tide.</p>
                        <p>6. Recommend that hard on the heels of the landing of the 1st elements of
                            the 1st Cavalry Division in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> that we
                            attack the <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> at Hanoi (<gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> 49) and at Haiphong (<gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> 48). A large percentage of the
                            population in the delta area would see the fires and all would know of
                            the attacks. Grossly exaggerated Hanoi air defense propaganda would
                            begin to ring hollow. These two actions would have a tremendous
                            psychological impact upon <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>1. I have read the White Paper and discussed it with <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Moyers</persName>, and
                            my brother <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName>. I also got some
                            free advice from Phil Potter, who called on another subject. Our
                            unanimous view is that it is a pretty feeble effort and that it does not
                            deserve top-level reply. So I would be inclined to go right past it in
                            the press conference tomorrow and to say simply that we maintain the
                            closest touch with Republican leaders like President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>

                            exclude. We are confident that the American people prefer the attitudes

                            Situation” drafted by the Mission Intelligence Committee and concurred
                            in by Ambassador Johnson and General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> which I have found of value and believe
                            will be of interest to concerned Washington agencies:</p>
                        <p>2. Hanoi appears to have made the decision last year to intensify the war
                            in South Vietnam. Whether the Communists actually expected to gain
                            complete victory this year, or merely to accelerate the transition to
                            their vaunted general counter-offensive, they had reason to hope that an
                            early victory was possible. The build-up of Viet Cong main force and
                            guerrilla units had made substantial progress, and the insurgents had
                            evolved tactics for meeting the improving <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> air and ground capabilities. Viet Cong successes in
                            countering the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s pacification
                            program had given the Communists control over wide areas which had
                            previously been dominated by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>;
                            their food situation had improved, and they had access to a substantial
                            manpower base. Infiltration of both men and material from the north was
                            essentially unchecked. <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> morale
                            clearly was sagging, and its desertion rate mounting. Political
                            instability in Saigon appeared to be heightened with each change of
                            government, and further violent clashes involving Catholic, Buddhist and
                            student elements seemed likely.</p>
                        <pb n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0377"/>
                        <p>3. Given these conditions, it must have appeared to Hanoi that a modest
                            escalation of Viet Cong military capabilities might permit the
                            insurgents to end the war relatively quickly. They may have calculated
                            that a successful military campaign would cause <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> and civilian morale to collapse,
                            produce an impression of the inevitability of Communist victory,
                            exacerbate political instability in Saigon, and create conditions
                            favorable for a general uprising through which the Communists could
                            seize power. Since the overthrow of the Diem government, Hanoi and the
                            Liberation Front had increasingly put such an uprising forward as a
                            feasible, quick alternative to the traditional protracted resistance
                            struggle. Even if their broader hopes were not realized, the Communists
                            probably believed that a successful offensive campaign by the reinforced
                            Viet Cong would permit them to attain the initiative and pave the way
                            for even greater offensive operations later this year. The Communists
                            may have calculated that they would have a reasonable chance of
                            achieving their aims without provoking increased U.S. intervention
                            because of the seeming reluctance—last fall—of the U.S. to commit its
                            military forces to operations in Vietnam. Even if the U.S. were to
                            react, the Communists may have felt they could attain their objectives
                            before U.S. intervention became effective.</p>
                        <p>4. To assure success, Hanoi evidently concluded that the military
                            capabilities of both the Viet Cong and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would have to be further strengthened. Although the
                            Viet Cong build-up was progressing favorably, their forces were clearly
                            incapable of mounting an offensive of the scale desired. Hence, one of
                            the goals established for 1964 was the accelerated expansion of Viet
                            Cong forces to the extent required to establish that equilibrium with
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s forces which is deemed
                            essential by the Communists for the shift to a general counteroffensive.
                            Toward this end, the Viet Cong intensified their recruiting and
                            conscription programs, creating a number of new main force battalions in
                            the southern delta, some of which were transferred to the area north of
                            Saigon. The flow of weapons and equipment from the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> was stepped up last fall to permit the
                            rearming of some existing units with more modern and effective small
                            arms, and heavy weapons, and to so equip some newly formed units. To add
                            further to Viet Cong capabilities, Hanoi took the calculated risk of
                            escalation by infiltrating regular units of the North Vietnamese Army
                                (<gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss>). All three infantry
                            regiments of the <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> 325th Division
                            evidently have been deployed to South Vietnam, and it is possible that
                            other units have been deployed without identification. To strengthen the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>'s capabilities against the
                            contingency of U.S. air attacks, Hanoi arranged with the Soviets in
                            February for a reinforcement of its air defense resources, to include
                            the introduction of surface-to-air missiles and the augmentation of the
                            nascent <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> air force.</p>
                        <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346" facs="0378"/>
                        <p>5. The military campaign planned by the Communists appears to be centered
                            on the highlands. While the Viet Cong regard the densely populated and
                            rice-rich Mekong Delta as the prize in South Vietnam, they consider the
                            highlands as the major battleground, since the difficult terrain, dense
                            vegetation, and limited lines of communication tend to minimize <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> ground and air superiorities. Their
                            concept of operations envisaged a series of major (regimental-size)
                            attacks against isolated outposts, aimed at destroying <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> garrisons and drawing <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> general reserve units into ambushes
                            under conditions favoring Viet Cong success. These larger actions were
                            to be supported by intensified, widespread guerrilla activity in order
                            to consolidate their hold on the people. The principal objectives of the
                            campaign were to destroy <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> units,
                            enlarge the liberated zones, and constrict <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> control to isolated district towns and provincial
                            capitals. In the highlands, it appears that they hope to eliminate the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> strongpoints north of Kontum and
                            create a large liberated area extending over most of Kontum, Pleiku,
                            Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh Provinces. This area, adjoining the Laos
                            infiltration corridor and offering motorable line of communications with
                            North Vietnam, could be developed into an extensive redoubt area from
                            which subsequent major operations could be mounted against the coastal
                            plain or into the southern highlands. In the area northeast of Saigon,
                            the Viet Cong concept was similar, based in this instance on the
                            enlargement of Zone D by extending the liberated area into Phuoc Long,
                            Long Khanh, Phuoc Tuy and Lam Dong Provinces. From this redoubt, the
                            Viet Cong would be in position to mount operations to link up with the
                            northern highlands redoubt, westward to join Zone D with Zone C in
                            northern Tay Ninh, or southwestward against Saigon itself.</p>
                        <p>6. Although they enjoyed some initial successes, the Viet Cong campaign
                            has been frustrated by a series of fortuitous <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> tactical moves coupled with the effective use of
                            increased US-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> air support. In the
                            prelude to their offensive, the Viet Cong inflicted heavy losses on
                                <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units at Binh Gia (Phuoc Tuy
                            Province) in December 1964 and in Binh Dinh Province in February 1965.
                            They suffered a setback in their attack on Song Be, the Phuoc Long
                            Province capital, in early May, but scored their most significant
                            success at Ba Gia in Quang Ngai Province later that month. On 1 June,
                            after overrunning Le Thanh district headquarters in western Pleiku, the
                            Viet Cong placed the <gloss target="#t_CIDG1">CIDG</gloss> camp at Duc
                            Co in a state of siege, which was to last over two months. The Viet Cong
                            suffered a setback in their attack on the district town of Dong Xoai in
                            Phuoc Long Province; although they inflicted heavy losses on <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> forces, they were unsuccessful in
                            their attempt to occupy the town and suffered estimated losses in excess
                            of 700 <gloss target="#t_KIA1">KIA</gloss>. In Phu Bon Province, the
                            Viet Cong have effectively blocked Route 7 and made gains in outlying

                            Province) and suffered heavily in an engagement with <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> airborne units. The “Geneva
                            armistice” anniversary attack on the <gloss target="#t_CIDG1">CIDG</gloss> post Bu Dop (Phuoc Long Province) was a costly
                            failure, although the Viet Cong profited indirectly when another camp
                            was abandoned to permit reinforcement of the Bu Dop garrison. In the
                            area north of Kontum, their first major gain was the district town of
                            Tuomoroung which fell on 25 July 1965. In mid-August, the Viet Cong
                            intensified their efforts to dislodge the garrison at Duc Co (Pleiku
                            Province) and suffered heavy losses when a joint <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>/US operation broke the 68-day siege.
                            On 18 August the Viet Cong furthered their gains in the area north of
                            Kontum when they successfully attacked and overran the district town and
                                <gloss target="#t_CIDG1">CIDG</gloss> post at Dak Sut. They have not
                            yet dislodged or destroyed the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            garrison at Tan Canh, near Dak To, and Dak Pek near the Laos border,
                            although they have the capability to do so at any time. The Viet Cong
                            have suffered a series of setbacks in fighting along Route 19, and have
                            been unable to deny to <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> the use
                            of any road when the latter made a determined effort to use them.</p>
                        <p>7. Thus, the Viet Cong have made some significant territorial gains
                            during their summer offensive. They also put six <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> battalions out of action in the
                            early stages of our campaign, but they were unable to sustain their
                            pattern of success when <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> altered
                            its normal reaction pattern and, in several instances, spoiled Viet Cong
                            preparations by mounting anticipatory operations. The Viet Cong did
                            succeed in disrupting lines of communication, effectively isolating the
                            highlands from the coast, and interdicting communications between most
                            of the coastal provincial capitals. In the Mekong Delta area, aggressive
                            operations by <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>'s IV Corps appear to
                            have frustrated Viet Cong plans for some major operations and have kept
                            their main force units off balance. <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> morale has not collapsed, and may have recovered
                            somewhat from its initial sag last spring. The political situation in
                            Saigon, although still precarious, is not as unstable as the Communists
                            hoped, and conditions are not ripe for a general uprising. Effective
                            police action in the cities, a by-product of draft enforcement
                            activities, and in part a result of improved counter-terror measures,
                            has resulted in the apprehension of a number of Viet Cong cadres and
                            probably has kept their subversive apparatus off-balance. Resources
                            control operations in the Hop Tac area have also resulted in the seizure
                            of explosives destined for Viet Cong terrorists in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>8. Not only has their campaign failed to achieve the optimum results
                            envisaged by Hanoi, but since its inception the strategic balance has
                            altered unfavorably for them. Preparations for the Viet Cong campaign
                            were underway before the U.S. began its air attacks on North Vietnam and
                            deployed its ground forces to South Vietnam—the bulk of the <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> 325th Division had entered the south
                            by February. Although US <pb n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0380"/>ground
                            forces have not yet played a major role on the main battlefields, the
                            Viet Cong are almost certainly becoming aware of the potential deriving
                            from their presence. Sounder minds in Hanoi must appreciate that the
                            opportunity for an early military victory has passed, and that the
                            forces now available to the Viet Cong are incapable of dislodging the US
                            forces from South Vietnam. Hanoi is therefore faced with the need to
                            reappraise the situation and reassess its alternatives.</p>
                        <p>9. Courses of action open to Hanoi include the following:</p>
                        <p>A. Massive reinforcement of the Viet Cong, in the form of an overt
                            invasion, in an attempt to regain their offensive momentum and perhaps
                            defeat US forces before they are firmly established.</p>
                        <p>B. Limited covert reinforcement by infiltrating one or two additional
                                <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> divisions in order to restore
                            the balance which has now swung in favor of the US-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces and permit the continuation of
                            recent levels of offensive activity.</p>
                        <p>C. Modest retrenchment of activity, reducing the number of major attacks
                            and placing greater emphasis on local guerrilla activity and on
                            consolidating their political base in preparation for a protracted
                            guerrilla struggle.</p>
                        <p>D. Substantial reduction of activity aimed at creating the impression of
                            a collapsing insurgency to lull the US into relaxing pressure on both
                            the north and the south.</p>
                        <p>E. In combination with any of the above, initiating diplomatic moves
                            designed to bring about negotiations for a settlement.</p>
                        <p>10. Massive reinforcement, either by <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> alone or with Chinese Communist participation, would
                            require assurance of logistic support on a scale which is probably
                            beyond the capacity of the disrupted lines of communication in the
                            southern <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. Moreover, both Hanoi and
                            Peking probably would estimate that such action might provoke more
                            extensive US air strikes against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            and possibly even Communist China if the latter were directly involved.
                            The same limitations would apply to the use of massive numbers of bloc
                            volunteers. This course of action cannot be ruled out entirely as an
                            irrational, desperation move to prevent the defeat of the Viet Cong or
                            to provide a temporary strengthening of the Communist position as a
                            prelude to negotiations. Because of the risks involved, however, the
                            Communists probably would be inclined initially to pursue more limited
                            aims which would be attained with limited means. The Chinese are also
                            capable of participating in the defense of North Vietnam against air
                            attacks, but have thus far shown an inclination to avoid involvement
                            except when US aircraft approach the Chinese border.</p>
                        <p>11. Limited covert reinforcement, on the order of one or two <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> divisions committed in the same
                            fashion as the 325th, is more within their capabilities. Such a move
                            would permit the Communists to restore <pb n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0381"/>some semblance of a balance of forces without serious
                            risk of escalation beyond North Vietnam. The principal disadvantage of
                            this course would be the uncertainty of adequate logistical support
                            pending the development of a motorable supply route through the Laos
                            panhandle. Any substantial increase in the number of troops in the
                            highlands area would also further strain the already difficult food
                            situation confronting Viet Cong forces in that region. The Communists
                            cannot be sure that they will be able to deliver sufficient quantities
                            of ammunition by sea in view of increasing US efforts to interdict this
                            line of supply. Some reinforcement is obviously necessary to prevent the
                            Viet Cong from losing the initiative to the expanding US-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces, but, if the movement of the
                            325th Division is any gauge, the deployment of further reinforcements
                            would require two to four months from the date of decision. Both Hanoi
                            and Liberation Front radio broadcasts appear to be laying the groundwork
                            for some reinforcement through their reference to organizing the
                            “regrouped southerners” in preparation for their return to the south. On
                            the other hand, it must now be apparent to Hanoi that growing US-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> air and ground capabilities pose
                            serious risks to large concentrations of insurgent forces, thereby
                            placing a premium on smaller scale guerrilla actions of a type for which
                            the capabilities of “foreign” <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss>
                            units are not best suited.</p>
                        <p>12. A modest retrenchment of activity, similar to that which occurred in
                            1962 after the initial US intervention, would permit the Viet Cong to
                            conserve the offensive potential of their main force units while
                            studying the impact of current US deployments and operations and
                            evolving a new strategic approach. Widespread guerrilla activity would
                            be continued to counter <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> pacification
                            operations while consolidating the Communist hold on “liberated areas”
                            and developing the Viet Cong subversive apparatus in areas largely under
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> influence. Hanoi could continue
                            the infiltration of key cadre elements and weapons and ammunition to
                            permit the expansion of local guerrilla forces. A major portion of the
                            Viet Cong main force units could be dispersed to support the guerrilla
                            campaign. The principal disadvantage of this course of action would be
                            its adverse impact on Viet Cong morale. Political cadres would face a
                            difficult task in re-educating even the main forces in terms of a
                            prolongation of the struggle. Conscription in Communist areas brought a
                            substantial number of relatively unindoctrinated youths into Viet Cong
                            units of all types, even into the main forces. These inexperienced
                            youngsters have already shown symptoms of an unwillingness to fight, as
                            reflected in the rising numbers of defectors and ralliers from the Viet
                            Cong. If US and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces succeed in
                            inflicting a number of significant defeats on the Viet Cong and continue
                            air actions at the current level, this morale problem will mount despite
                            Viet Cong indoctrination efforts. Although a temporary retrenchment
                            would not decisively impair Viet <pb n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0382"/>Cong morale, a prolonged retrenchment might pose insurmountable
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>13. A substantial reduction of activity, coupled with a voluntary
                            curtailment of support from the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>,
                            might be attempted in an effort to lull the US into relaxing its
                            pressure. This course would, in effect, produce a limited disengagement.
                            By giving the appearance of a collapsing insurgency and avoiding major
                            actions, the Viet Cong might hope that the US would be inclined to
                            reduce its forces and discontinue its bombing attacks on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. The disadvantages of this course are
                            similar to those enumerated in the preceding paragraph. The adverse
                            psychological impact on the Viet Cong would be even greater, however,
                            since the absence of support from the north would tend to discourage
                            even some hard-core insurgents. If it were explained as a ruse, the Viet
                            Cong could not be assured that word of this would not reach US and
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> authorities, thereby negating
                            the effectiveness of this course. Hanoi might be tempted to adopt this
                            course however, taking the calculated risk that enough of the Communist
                            structure could be held together to permit a renewal of insurgent
                            activity when conditions were more favorable.</p>
                        <p>14. The Communists could, at any time, embark on diplomatic moves aimed
                            at bringing about negotiations for a settlement. They are not likely to
                            undertake this course until convinced that they cannot achieve success
                            by violent means in the south. <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            leaders continue to give the impression of confidence in the ultimate
                            success of the insurgency, and so far have conveyed no hint that they
                            are prepared to relax their conditions for the initiation of
                            negotiations or for a settlement. Should the Communists agree to
                            negotiations, they will probably first attempt some form of major
                            military action designed to strengthen their position. They can be
                            expected also to demand concessions on our part which would relax US
                            military pressure during the period of negotiations.</p>
                        <p>15. There are indications that the Communists have already laid down the
                            guidelines for their autumn-winter campaign. Agent reports suggest these
                            are similar—for the Delta area—to those of the summer campaign. Both
                            Hanoi and Liberation Front broadcasts reflect continued determination to
                            press the war, and indicate preparations are underway for the
                            introduction of additional troops from the north. On the other hand,
                            they now speak in terms of a prolongation of the struggle for up to
                            twenty to twenty-five years, suggesting that they see scant prospect for
                            the short-cut solution they were touting as possible only a few months
                            ago. Appeals to the urban populace to prepare for the violent overthrow
                            of the government have similarly lost their urgency. There are no
                            indications that the Communists are preparing for a massive
                            reinsurgement. Continuation of the insurgency at the present level or
                            retrenchment of activity poses serious problems with respect to
                            surrendering the initiative <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0383"/>to
                            the reinforced US-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces and
                            sustaining Viet Cong morale. Only limited overt reinforcement—provided
                            the logistical problem is overcome—offers some prospects for negating
                            the impact of the US build-up and sustaining the morale of the Viet
                            Cong.</p>
                        <p>16. In conclusion, lack of complete success of their summer campaign has
                            frustrated Viet Cong aims for 1965. If they have not done so thus far,
                            the Communists must soon acknowledge their inability either to achieve
                            an early victory or to dislodge the growing military strength of the US
                            forces in the south. Massive intervention is probably beyond their
                            capability to support, and would carry with it the risk of a substantial
                            widening of the war. While retrenchment might permit them to conserve
                            their capabilities, it would pose serious morale problems, and would
                            surrender the initiative to the US and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces, which would gradually be able to resume
                            pacification programs and regain control over populated areas recently
                            acquired by the Communists. Only limited reinforcement offers prospects
                            for sustaining the insurgency on a scale and at a level that provides
                            reasonable expectation of successfully testing and perhaps eroding US
                            determination to continue the war. Diplomatic moves to open negotiations
                            would appear unlikely until the Communists are convinced that US
                            determination to continue the war cannot be eroded and that defeat of
                            the Viet Cong is probable.</p>

                                    <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 15 VIET S)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. I had a meeting yesterday afternoon alone with General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> which lasted almost an hour, with him
                            doing almost all the talking in <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0384"/>deliberate, grammatical English, sometimes interspersed with French. I
                            began by saying that I wished to help in every possible way and that he
                            could count on me to respect a confidence.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> covered many subjects, but
                            his chief contention was that the people insisted on a revolution, that
                            it was impossible to compete with the Communists without treating the
                            peasant, the poor man, the laborer, and the soldier properly. Neither
                            Minh, <persName corresp="#p_Khanh1">Khanh</persName> nor <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> had really understood what a
                            revolution is all about.</p>
                        <p>3. It was impossible for a civilian government to carry out a revolution
                            with the military standing on the sidelines complaining. The military
                            had the power in Vietnam and they had to meet their responsibility.</p>
                        <p>4. For the future, he wanted the Americans to hold the “strategic points”
                            so that the Vietnamese could concentrate on pacification operations. He
                            was disgusted with the <persName corresp="#p_Chieu1">Chieu
                                Hoi</persName> program and the way it had been run and said that
                            much American money had been wasted. There were 30,000 cadres in various
                            government departments which he was going to regroup and retrain, and
                            send them to the 235 districts in the country. He would have a paper on
                            this for me to read very soon.</p>
                        <p>5. I agreed that a Communist offer of a revolution, even though it was in
                            brutality and slavery, could only be beaten by an offer of a revolution
                            for a new life in freedom. We Americans agreed completely and stood
                            ready to help. There were some things which we could not do, but there
                            were many which we could do. If he and his associates could stay in
                            power for a reasonable period of time, then it could be done. But
                            another coup would really be bad. Could we be helpful in this
                            regard.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> smiled at this, and it seemed
                            to me that he didn't take the possibility of a coup very seriously. He
                            said he had been at Dalat for the last two days and had met with all
                            division and corps commanders, and that they had all been in agreement.
                            He said there had been discussion about my arrival signifying that
                            something new was being brought into the Vietnamese problems. They did
                            not know whether this was true, but they all agreed that I was against
                            Communism.</p>
                        <p>7. Comment: If this is true, it is good that I am not taken for granted.
                            My main hope at the meeting with <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> was not to settle any specific problem, but to
                            develop a good atmosphere. I feel that this was done to some extent. He
                            was rather tense when I arrived but he had a big smile on his face and
                            was much more relaxed when I left.</p>
                        <p>8. Other remarks by <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> were as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>A. The Communists gave the peasant what in effect is a license to kill
                            the landlord and then take the land themselves. “We can do better than
                            that,” said <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>. I assured him of
                            our desire to help, having in mind the report that landlords are heavily
                            represented among generals.</p>
                        <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353" facs="0385"/>
                        <p>B. <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> said he was aware of the
                            importance of having able Ambassadors and that he would make a number of
                            appointments soon. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>.</p>

                        <p>1. The United States believes that your memorandum of August 12<note n="2" xml:id="d129fn2">See <ref target="#d119">Document
                                119</ref>.</note> contains a number of highly constructive
                            suggestions. It is our earnest hope that the memorandum will be useful
                            in initiating discussions which can provide a basis for the settlement
                            of the Viet Nam conflict. The views expressed below are designed to
                            contribute to this important objective.</p>
                        <p>2. We agree with your observation that the objective of a Viet Nam
                            settlement should be “a return to the essentials of the 1954 Geneva
                            Agreements.”</p>
                        <p>3. We concur in the principle you have set forth that neither zone in
                            Viet Nam should adhere to a military alliance or furnish military bases
                            to others, and that foreign troops should be withdrawn from both zones.
                            You have already cited President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s statement of April 7<note n="3" xml:id="d129fn3">See <ref target="frus1964-68v02#d245">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964-1968, vol. II,
                                    Document 245</ref>.</note> to this effect on military alliances
                            and military bases. On troop withdrawal, the United States stated on
                            April 8 in reply to the 17-nation declaration on <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0386"/>Viet Nam “… when conditions have been
                            created in which the people of South Viet Nam can determine their own
                            future free from external interference, the United States will be ready
                            and eager to withdraw its forces from South Viet Nam.”<note n="4" xml:id="d129fn4">For complete text of this statement, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents,
                                    1965</hi>, pp. 853-854.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. Equally basic is the principle of the Geneva Agreements that neither
                            zone of Viet Nam should interfere in the affairs of the other zone. This
                            principle was incorporated in numerous provisions of the Agreements,
                            including Articles 19 and 24 of the Agreement on the Cessation of
                            Hostilities in Viet Nam<note n="5" xml:id="d129fn5">For text of the

                            Article 5 of the Final Declaration of the 1954 Geneva Conference,<note n="6" xml:id="d129fn6">For text of the declaration, signed on July
                                21, 1954, see ibid., pp. 1540-1542.</note> providing that the
                            respective zones “shall not be utilized for the resumption of
                            hostilities or in the service of an aggressive policy.” It is the
                            violation of this principle by the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            which has led to the conflict in Viet Nam and to the presence of
                            American forces in the Republic of Viet Nam. These forces, like the
                            forces of other states assisting the Republic of Viet Nam, have as their
                            sole purpose its protection against aggression, consistent with the
                            provisions of the United Nations Charter.</p>
                        <p>5. It is therefore essential that provisions be made in any settlement of
                            the problem of Viet Nam for the withdrawal from South Viet Nam of the
                            troops and cadres infiltrated from North Viet Nam into the South. The
                            modalities and timing of withdrawal of American and other forces
                            assisting the Government of the Republic of Viet Nam can, of course,
                            only be worked out in the light of similar dispositions regarding the
                            tens of thousands of regrouped Southerners and Northerners infiltrated
                            by North Viet Nam into South Viet Nam over the past several years.</p>
                        <p>6. A third basic principle of the Geneva Agreements of 1954 was to ensure
                            that the people of Viet Nam have the right of free choice. That purpose
                            still guides our actions in two fundamental respects related to the
                            Geneva Agreements:</p>
                        <p>a. We maintain that the people of South Viet Nam should have the right to
                            shape their own destiny by peaceful, democratic means and without
                            interference from an aggressive neighbor to the north.</p>
                        <p>b. We believe that the people of both South Viet Nam and North Viet Nam
                            should have the right of free choice regarding the reunification of Viet
                            Nam. As called for in the Geneva Agreements, any elections held for this
                            purpose should be truly free and secret, with effective international
                            supervision. It was in this sense that President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> on July 28 referred to “free
                            elections … throughout all Viet Nam under international
                                supervision.”<note n="7" xml:id="d129fn7">See <ref target="#d97">Document 97</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0387"/>
                        <p>7. With respect to the political problems of South Viet Nam, we do not
                            consider that the provisions of the Geneva Agreements of 1954 are
                            directly applicable to the resolution of the internal problems of either
                            North or South Viet Nam separately, pending procedures for reunification
                            as discussed above. In this connection, the United States Government
                            notes that the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Viet Nam, on June 22,
                            made clear the view of the Republic of Viet Nam that South Viet Nam
                            should be free to shape its own destiny “in conformity with established
                            democratic processes without any intervention of whatever form and
                            whatever source.”<note n="8" xml:id="d129fn8">For an excerpt from
                                Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Tran Van

                            Secretary Rusk noted on June 23, the United States Government fully
                            supports this principle,<note n="9" xml:id="d129fn9">For text of Rusk's
                                remarks, see ibid., pp. 884-886.</note> and it was in this sense
                            also that President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                            referred on July 28 to “free elections in the South.” North Viet Nam
                            appears to have expressed a different point of view. We would welcome
                            any appropriate efforts by the Secretary-General to determine whether
                            these divergencies are in fact as profound as they now appear.</p>
                        <p>8. We concur in the Secretary-General's suggestion that a cessation of
                            military activity might be subject to a variety of formulae, and that it
                            might initially be a matter for de facto action—by both sides—rather
                            than for a more formal arrangement. In any unconditional discussions, or
                            in a conference, conditions for the cessation of hostilities might well
                            be the first order of business.</p>
                        <p>9. Finally, with respect to the role of the so-called National Liberation
                            Front, we agree that issues of this type need not and should not
                            obstruct the way to a settlement. On July 28 President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> referred to negotiation taking
                            place with governments (for example, if there should be a Geneva
                            Conference, those governments which participated in the Geneva
                            Conference of 1954), and indicated that the Viet Cong would have no
                            difficulty being represented and having their views represented if Hanoi
                            desired a peaceful settlement. This should not be an insurmountable
                            problem and could be worked out. This position does not, of course,
                            prejudice the United States Government's view that the so-called
                            National Liberation Front is not in fact an independent party inasmuch
                            as it has been established and is controlled by Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>10. We remain prepared to engage in unconditional discussions looking
                            toward a peaceful settlement whenever the other side is ready. This can
                            be done, for example, through reconvening the 1954 Geneva Conference or
                            by other means, including discussions through your good offices. We
                            shall give serious consideration to any proposals of this character. End

                        <p>1. (S) In the light of the introduction of major US combat units into
                            Southeast Asia, the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider it essential that we
                            further formalize our concept for the future conduct of the war.
                            Recognizing this need, they have developed a concept as set forth in the
                            Appendix. This concept, in which the views of <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> have been considered, envisions
                            the military actions that are part of the over-all US strategy for
                            Southeast Asia, including South Vietnam, North Vietnam, Thailand, and
                            Laos. The correlated military actions to carry out this strategy will be
                            conducted in concert with US major political, economic, and social
                            programs for Southeast Asia. They also will include measures for dealing
                            with the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> threat.</p>
                        <p>2. (TS) In summary:</p>
                        <p>a. The objective in Vietnam, as stated by <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss>-288, dated 17 March 1964,<note n="2" xml:id="d130fn2">See <ref target="frus1964-68v01#d87">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964-1968, vol. I,
                                    Document 87</ref>.</note> is a stable and independent
                            noncommunist government.</p>
                        <pb n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0389"/>
                        <p>b. The major problems to be dealt with in the conduct of the war are:</p>
                        <p>(1) The continued direction and support of Viet Cong operations by the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, infiltration from the north,
                            and the apparent attendant Viet Cong capability to provide materiel
                            support and to replace heavy personnel losses.</p>
                        <p>(2) The continued existence of a major Viet Cong infrastructure, both
                            political and military, in the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>(3) The greater growth rate of Viet Cong strength as compared to that of
                            the South Vietnamese ground forces.</p>
                        <p>(4) The continued loss of <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>s,
                            food-producing areas, and population to Viet Cong control.</p>
                        <p>(5) The lack of a viable politico/economic structure in the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>(6) The threat of ChiCom intervention or aggression in Southeast Asia and
                            elsewhere in the Western Pacific.</p>
                        <p>c. The basic military tasks, of equal priority, are:</p>
                        <p>(1) To cause the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to cease its
                            direction and support of the Viet Cong insurgency.</p>
                        <p>(2) To defeat the Viet Cong and to extend <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> control over all of the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>(3) To deter Communist China from direct intervention and to defeat such
                            intervention if it occurs.</p>
                        <p>d. The US basic strategy for accomplishing the above tasks should be: to
                            intensify military pressure on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            by air and naval power; to destroy significant <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> military targets, including the base of supplies; to
                            interdict supporting <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>s in the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>; to interdict the infiltration and
                            supply routes into the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>; to improve
                            the combat effectiveness of the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>;
                            to build and protect bases; to reduce enemy reinforcements; to defeat
                            the Viet Cong, in concert with <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> and
                            third country forces; and to maintain adequate forces in the Western
                            Pacific and elsewhere in readiness to deter and to deal with <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> aggression. By aggressive and
                            sustained exploitation of superior military force, the United
                            States/Government of Vietnam would seize and hold the initiative in both
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>, keeping the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, the
                            Viet Cong, and the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VM1">VM</gloss> at a disadvantage, progressively
                            destroying the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> war-supporting power
                            and defeating the Viet Cong. The physical capability of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to move men and supplies through the
                            Lao Corridor, down the coastline, across the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, and through Cambodia must be reduced to the maximum
                            practical extent by land, naval, and air actions in these areas and
                            against infiltration-connected targets. Finally, included within the
                            basic US military strategy must be a buildup in Thailand to ensure
                            attainment of the proper US-Thai posture to deter <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> aggression and to facilitate
                            placing US forces in an advantageous logistic position if such
                            aggression occurs.</p>
                        <p>3. (S) The over-all strategic concept for Vietnam, as set forth in the
                            Appendix hereto, provides a basis for terminating the war in Vietnam <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0390"/>under conditions which are
                            satisfactory to the United States and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. (S) The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that the attached concept be
                            approved as the basis for subsequent development of courses of action,
                            forces, and other requirements to include the phasing of operations.
                            Recommendations based thereon, including a current evaluation of the
                            capabilities of approved force deployments to achieve the objectives of
                            the concept, will be provided you at the earliest practicable date.</p>

                        <p>2. (S) The military operations envisioned in this concept paper must:</p>
                        <p>a. Conform to the over-all US strategy and guidelines for Southeast Asia
                            as a whole, including the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, Laos, and Thailand.</p>

                        <p>Factors Bearing on the Development of a US Military Strategy for
                            Vietnam</p>
                        <p>3. (S) The Viet Cong are directed, controlled, and supported (including
                            heavy military support and encadrement) by their sponsor, <pb n="359" xml:id="pg_359" facs="0391"/>the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. Viet Cong activities in the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> are characterized by persuasion through propaganda,
                            intimidation, and terror. Whenever possible, through armed assault and
                            coercion, the Viet Cong destroy the capability of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> authority to govern, thus progressively
                            reducing the ability of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to bring
                            the population and resources base to bear on the problem. Having assumed
                            control over an area, the Viet Cong install their own political
                            organization and infrastructure. Then, using local manpower and
                            logistics, the Viet Cong organize, equip, and train military units to
                            resist <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> attempts to establish its
                            authority and to expand Viet Cong control and influence into other
                            areas.</p>
                        <p>4. (S) For the most part, the Viet Cong have sought to avoid a
                            large-scale sustained battle with US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            forces. Instead, their tactics have been to maximize the advantages of
                            initiative and surprise and to strike at weakness with overwhelming
                            strength, “fading away” when the combat strength ratio is unfavorable to
                            them. Currently, one of their major objectives appears to be the
                            destruction, through both attrition and demoralization, of the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. (TS) At present, the Viet Cong and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            leaders appear confident that their course in the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> promises ultimate and possibly early
                            success without important concessions on their part. This apparent
                            confidence may have been fostered in part by the current quest for some
                            negotiating arrangement. They seem to believe that they can achieve a
                            series of local military successes which, sooner or later, will bring
                            victory through a combination of a deteriorating South Vietnamese Army
                                (<gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>) morale and effectiveness, a
                            collapse of anti-communist government in Saigon, and an exhaustion of
                            the United States will to persist.</p>
                        <p>6. (TS) In coping with larger US forces employed in a more aggressive
                            fashion, the Viet Cong would seek to avoid the kind of engagements which
                            risked a serious communist defeat. Instead, they would probably
                            concentrate on harassments intended to bleed and humiliate US forces,
                            attempting to trap and destroy isolated units where possible. At a
                            minimum, the Viet Cong would almost certainly continue present efforts
                            to cut land communications lines and would step up the dispatch of
                            small, expendable teams on sabotage and assassination missions designed
                            to gain propaganda advantages. The communists might also seek to
                            increase their activities in Laos.</p>
                        <p>7. (TS) Additionally, there is the possibility of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> overt commitment of major combat
                            forces in Southeast Asia and other areas in the Western Pacific. With
                            the greater US involvement in the war in Vietnam, US military posture
                            must be so oriented as to deter <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> intervention and defeat this intervention should it
                            occur.</p>
                        <p>8. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The war in Vietnam is the single
                            most critical international problem facing the United States today, and
                            it portends the most serious immediate threat to continued US world
                            leadership and national security.<pb n="360" xml:id="pg_360" facs="0392"/> The development of a US strategy for Vietnam is necessarily
                            influenced in varying degrees by the desirability to maintain amicable
                            relations with certain other nations; by the desirability to receive
                            from third countries a degree of support for US policy; by US objectives
                            and alliances elsewhere; by the fact of the sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>; and, by the necessity to provide an
                            effective Free World counter or answer to “wars of national
                            liberation.”</p>
                        <p>9. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The situation in the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> has deteriorated to the point where US
                            national objectives are endangered and may not be achieved unless <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces are bolstered, adequate security
                            for the South Vietnamese people is provided, and the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> is persuaded that the risks of further
                            involvement on their part outweigh the gains.</p>
                        <p>10. (TS) Our strategy for Vietnam should not allow the communists to keep
                            pace with or more than match our military efforts. A program of slowly
                            rising intensity with both sides in step carries with it the danger that
                            it will lead to less flexibility of choice, creeping intervention by the
                            Soviets and Chinese, first with materiel and later with troops, and the
                            eventual engulfing of both camps unwillingly into an expanded war.</p>
                        <p>11. (TS) Briefly, the major problems to be dealt with in the conduct of
                            the war are:</p>
                        <p>a. The continued direction and support of Viet Cong operations by the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, including infiltration from the
                            North, and the apparent attendant Viet Cong capability to provide
                            materiel support and to replace heavy personnel losses.</p>
                        <p>b. The continued existence of a major Viet Cong infrastructure, both

                                [Footnote in the source text.]</note> includes as an objective in
                            the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> a stable and independent
                            noncommunist government. Implicit in this objective is the containment
                            of Communist China insofar as expansion into Southeast Asia or elsewhere
                            in the Western Pacific is concerned. Basic military tasks, of equal
                            priority, in support of this objective are:</p>
                        <p>a. To cause the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to cease its
                            direction and support of the Viet Cong insurgency.</p>
                        <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0393"/>
                        <p>b. To defeat the Viet Cong and to extend <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> control over all of the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>c. To deter Communist China from direct intervention and to defeat such
                            intervention if it occurs.</p>
                        <p>13. (TS) Friendly control of population and resources is essential to
                            success in countering guerrilla warfare. In this regard, the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> areas of major military significance
                            are: the Saigon area and the Mekong Delta; the coastal plain; and the
                            central highlands. It is imperative that the US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> have the support of the people and the control of
                            resources in those areas. Elimination of the Viet Cong from these areas
                            must be vigorously undertaken in order to provide adequate security for
                            the people. Of particular importance is the need for friendly control of
                            the main food-producing areas in order that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> may gain control of rice, feed the people under its
                            control, enable exports of rice to bolster the economy, and cause the
                            Viet Cong to import or to fight for food. A paramount requirement under
                            this concept is the building and maintaining of a series of secure bases
                            and secure supporting <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>s at key
                            localities along the sea coast, and elsewhere as necessary, from which
                            offensive operations can be launched and sustained, with the subsequent
                            enlargement and expansion of the secure areas.</p>
                        <p>14. (TS) The US basic strategy for accomplishing the above tasks should
                            be: to intensify military pressure on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> by air and naval power; to destroy significant <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> military targets, including the base of
                            supplies; to interdict supporting <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>s
                            in the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>; to interdict the
                            infiltration and supply routes into the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>; to improve the combat effectiveness of the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>; to build and protect bases; to
                            reduce enemy reinforcements; to defeat the Viet Cong in concert with
                                <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> and third country forces; and,
                            to maintain adequate forces in the Western Pacific and elsewhere in
                            readiness to deter and to deal with <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> aggression. By aggressive and sustained exploitation
                            of superior military force, the United States/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would seize and hold the initiative in both the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>, keeping the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, the
                            Viet Cong, and the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VM1">VM</gloss> at a disadvantage, progressively
                            destroying the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> war-supporting power
                            and defeating the Viet Cong. The physical capability of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to move men and supplies through the
                            Lao Corridor, down the coastline, across the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, and through Cambodia, must be reduced to the maximum
                            practical extent by land, naval, and air actions in these areas and
                            against infiltration-connected targets. Finally, included within the
                            basic US military strategy must be a build-up in Thailand to ensure
                            attainment of the proper US-Thai posture to deter <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> aggression and to facilitate
                            placing US forces in an advantageous logistic position if such

                            must be made not only in terms of direct combat action to expand the
                            areas under US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> control but also to

                            progress. It will be noted in paragraph 13 above that, along with the
                            Saigon area, the Mekong Delta is considered of primary importance. While
                            no US land operations are currently envisaged in the Mekong Delta (IV
                            Corps Tactical Zone) because of the comparatively inactive enemy
                            situation now existing there, increased Viet Cong activity could later
                            necessitate US/Third Country operations in that important area.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>Herewith are some of my innermost preoccupations, which I have sent to no
                            one else, and which I send to you in the hope that they may prevent
                            reverses in the future. I will, of course, be glad to have this letter
                            go to Dean Rusk, Bob McNamara and MacBundy—and anyone else whom you may
                            choose.</p>
                        <p>I am concerned about the current U.S. stress on a “settlement” and on
                            “negotiations” to the neglect of the concept of a satisfactory “outcome”
                            or “result”.</p>
                        <p>I believe that with great and sustained effort we can get a satisfactory
                            “outcome”, but it is hard for me to visualize a satisfactory
                            “settlement”. <pb n="364" xml:id="pg_364" facs="0396"/>In other words,
                            we can succeed in warding off the communist aggression, but we will not
                            get them to admit it. If we do get a satisfactory “outcome”, it will be
                            a real achievement in which we will all be able to take pride.</p>
                        <p>You should probably make an announcement about it. It must look like the
                            true success which it most certainly would be, and it must not look like
                            a failure because we have not achieved a “settlement”—or because General
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> doesn't
                            enthuse.</p>
                        <p>We should therefore stress the need for warding off the aggression, for
                            getting a satisfactory “outcome”, and not lay so much stress on
                            diplomatic settlements which we probably are not going to be able to
                            get. The attempt to do so would probably make <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> lose face, thus causing him
                            to fight harder, thus lengthening the war and increasing the
                            bloodshed.</p>
                        <p>If I am wrong, and we do get a neat diplomatic document in which the
                            communists admit that they have been beaten, then we have lost nothing
                            by following my advice—although it is hard to understand the value of
                            such a document given the worthlessness of such a communist
                            commitment.</p>
                        <p>Let me give two illustrations:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Illustration No. 1</p>
                        <p>The heartland of Viet-Nam, as is shown on a population map which I
                            recently sent to <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Mac Bundy</persName>,
                            consists of the coastal plain plus the Delta (of which I class Saigon as
                            a part). About 65 per cent of the population is in those areas.</p>
                        <p>Suppose that we and the Vietnamese:</p>
                        <p>—really control the coastal plain (as we appear to be on the way to
                            doing);</p>
                        <p>—eliminate the Viet Cong from the Saigon-Delta area (which we have not
                            done, but which could be done); and</p>
                        <p>—continue to hold the 43 provincial capitals which we now hold as well as
                            the 240-odd district towns; and</p>
                        <p>Then suppose that:</p>
                        <p>we are strong enough in all these places so that with our air, sea and
                            ground power we can force the Viet Cong to stay back in the hills—or the
                            Camau peninsula—with the snakes and the tigers because they get such a
                            bloody nose every time they try to attack.</p>
                        <p>If all these things happen, we will be in a very strong position indeed
                            and everything else after that will be mopping up. We will be in control
                            of areas with a total population of about 11 million out of a national
                            total of about 15 million. (Source: Statistics Branch-<gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> Public Administration Division)</p>
                        <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365" facs="0397"/>
                        <p>Neither in the Philippines nor in Malaya was every last communist
                            guerrilla apprehended. Some of them became farmers and some of them went
                            into the hills where they still are—and where they do no harm.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Illustration No. 2</p>
                        <p>Another possibility is that the Viet Cong suddenly decides to stop
                            fighting and that a silence falls. This has happened in other oriental
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>We would consider either of the above illustrations as a satisfactory
                            outcome, and you would be entitled to put it out to the public as an
                            effective warding off of the aggression—something in which all Americans
                            could take pride.</p>
                        <p>But if you make a “settlement” and diplomatic “negotiations” as a symbol
                            of success, you are really reaching for the moon. The communists do not
                            like to sign papers in which they admit that they were defeated. They
                            prefer always to leave these situations hanging, with the implication
                            that a few years later they may be back. The fact that they don't come
                            back forcefully (as they didn't in the Philippines and in Malaya)
                            doesn't alter the fact that they don't like to look as though they have
                            given up.</p>
                        <p>I understand fully the inestimable value of making it clear to public
                            opinion at home that you are willing to go anywhere and try anything for
                            the sake of peace. It is your willingness to do this which has been a
                            major factor in the extremely skillful job which you have done in
                            unifying American public opinion behind U.S. policy in Viet-Nam—a
                            remarkable performance in every way. But I hope that you can keep U.S.
                            opinion united without at the same time getting yourself into a position
                            where you can't get credit for a satisfactory outcome once it is
                            achieved.</p>
                        <p>It is surely possible, as we have done so far, to handle U Thant
                            carefully without over-praising him. Surely the aggression can be
                            successfully warded off without at the same time stipulating a
                            re-affirmation of the Geneva agreement, a guarantee of free elections,
                            and undertakings concerning reunification of North and South
                            Viet-Nam—which are not worth much when signed.</p>
                        <p>With warm and respectful regards,</p>

                            only as forces arrive in the theater.</p>

                        <p>Today's long and fumbling session with <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> produced a very few elements useful in a
                            diagnosis of the Hanoi position but hardly anything that would advance
                            negotiations. Although <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>
                            insists he has been consistent throughout discussions he seems to
                            fluctuate in phase with Hanoi's pronouncements and this evening he took
                            a stiff line in an obvious effort to parallel that taken by Pham Van
                            Dong in declaration<note n="2" xml:id="d133fn2">Pham Van Dong's National
                                Day report on August 31 was broadcast in English over Hanoi Radio on

                            </hi>. Principal points to emerge were:</p>
                        <p>(a) According to <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>, any
                            “final solution would have to include a withdrawal of U.S. troops (Pham
                            Van Dong appears to call for their withdrawal now), and in any case
                            troops would have to have left before elections could take place. This
                            was first time <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> had made
                            this link.</p>
                        <p>(b) U.S. bombing, especially its intensification north and south in the
                            last fifteen days, could only be interpreted as attempt to force Hanoi
                            to negotiate. Also, U.S. insistence on “counterpart” concessions by
                            Hanoi was psychological warfare and unacceptable. Still, according to
                                <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>, bombing was
                            unilaterally undertaken; it must be stopped unilaterally immediately,
                            totally, and definitively; then and then only would there be a different
                            atmosphere and a possibility for negotiations. There could be no
                            question, he said, of accepting conditions laid down by U.S. ahead of
                            time as price of suspension of bombing.</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> opened by remarking that his
                            conversations with <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> had
                            aroused a lively interest among his friends in Washington, of which
                                <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> would find evidence
                            in TV interview of Secretary Rusk (August 23).<note n="3" xml:id="d133fn3">For a transcript of the interview, in which
                                    <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> and McGeorge
                                Bundy also participated, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, September 13, 1965, pp. 431-444.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> would find some
                            familiar expressions in this discourse and he would also find
                            confirmation that U.S. policy was the same as that expressed in the four
                            points which <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> had proposed to
                                <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> read extensively from the
                            interview and left the text with <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>. He noticed that the latter showed particular
                            interest in Rusk's expression of confidence in elections in the south
                            which <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> seemed to find
                            fantastic. He derided the Saigon Government as U.S. creatures and <pb n="368" xml:id="pg_368" facs="0400"/>jeered at its instability and
                            said that practically all Vietnamese, especially since <persName corresp="#p_Diem1">Diem</persName>'s oppression of nationalist
                            elements, utterly rejected it. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName>
                            observed he could not of course accept this evaluation and said whatever
                            it was southern population wanted he and <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> both knew that they didn't want Hanoi imposed on
                            them. Whatever procession governments in Saigon indicated it clearly
                            showed U.S. was not imposing a regime. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> retorted with the Vietnamese proverb to the
                            effect a sorcerer can raise phantoms but after a while they control the
                            sorcerer.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> indicated that that
                            might be but Hanoi had no intention of imposing a regime in the
                            south.</p>
                        <p>3. Discussion of bombing followed <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName>'s quotation of Rusk TV remarks on subject and was
                            intermittent throughout the rambling discussion. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> recalled <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>'s inquiry about U.S. Aide-Memoire<note n="4" xml:id="d133fn4">Not further identified.</note> and read excerpts
                            from the Memoire. Also left with <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> handwritten rough translation of pertinent
                            paragraphs on bombing. Also referred to British White Paper<note n="5" xml:id="d133fn5">For text, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, September 13, 1965, pp. 444-447.</note> and the
                            phrase “appropriate and commensurate” in connection with desired type of
                            response from Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>'s temperature here
                            rose to something approaching heat. He denounced U.S. proposal as
                            psychological warfare, as an effort to impress world opinion, etc. He
                            said that the intensification of military activity in the south and
                            bombing north and south, particularly in the last two weeks, showed U.S.
                            trying to compel Hanoi to the conference table. In these conditions
                            there could be no question of Hanoi's yielding. It was left with no
                            alternative but to continue the war. He insisted that U.S. requirement
                            of a counterpart was unrealistic; that U.S. began the bombing
                            unilaterally and should stop it unilaterally and stop its “aggression”
                            as well. He claimed to believe U.S. demanding as counterparts
                            concessions tantamount to abandoning Hanoi's entire military position
                                (<persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> cannot recall just what
                            particulars <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> cited).</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> again resorted to
                            phrase about “allegations” re activity of 325th North Viet Division.
                            Later when <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> said—you apparently
                            now deny 325th Division in the south, <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> said he did not deny it. He claimed, however,
                            that the 325th not now engaged in military operations.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> suggested that he preferred
                            Secretary's word “signal” to <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>'s word “counterpart”. U.S. not asking Hanoi to
                            abandon all its military leverage but wanted at least a token that U.S.
                            gesture in stopping bombing was understood as move toward peaceful
                            settlement. He quoted the U.S. Aide-Memoire to suggest other
                            possibilities for a response by Hanoi, such as stopping infiltration and
                            reducing level of <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0401"/>incidents. On
                            latter point <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> also referred to
                            Algerian precedent when French found it easier to come to conference
                            table when incidents dropped below certain level. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> said U.S. could not be expected to halt
                            bombing under circumstances which made it look as though it had found
                            the going too rough and too rude and was accepting military reverse.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> at no time rose to
                            bait on stopping infiltration or reduction of incidents. All he would
                            say (and repeatedly) was that if the U.S. stopped the bombing
                            unilaterally there would be a new atmosphere and a new deal.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> then went so far as to ask
                                <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> to comment on
                            handling the problem of a Hanoi response through device of parallel but
                            ostensibly unlinked courses of action, i.e., U.S. to halt bombing while
                            there would be simultaneous actions by Hanoi possibly synchronized by
                            “third party” unspecified.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> appeared interested
                            but would say only in effect that if U.S. so acted one would see.
                            However, he then repeatedly revived other Hanoi conditions, including
                            acceptance of the program of the “Front”, halting of U.S. “aggression”,
                            etc.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> again insisted he and
                                <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> losing time using
                            words like “aggression”. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> said he willing to substitute “war”. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName>'s reply to charge that U.S.
                            aggressively interested [intensified?] bombing was that Hanoi had been
                            unilaterally making war on the south for four years previously, to which
                            answer <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> sharply
                            interjected accusation about <persName corresp="#p_Diem1">Diem</persName>'s activities.</p>
                        <p>11. According to <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> his friends in
                            U.S. wanted some sign Hanoi understood what halt in bombing meant.
                                <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> should be aware
                            restraint in U.S. bombing policy. Although it could easily do so, U.S.
                            not interfering directly with harvest, had not destroyed Haiphong, was
                            not at the present time breaking up industry. Of course there was a
                            rising curve in military actions, especially as military machines on
                            both sides took hold and passions were aroused, but this is what he and
                                <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> had the opportunity
                            to prevent.</p>
                        <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> quite excitedly said
                                <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> was wrong, that thousands
                            were being killed, that he had the figures to show it. It was more
                            obvious than ever before that Hanoi and <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, both north and south, are being grievously hurt. For
                            present, however, <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> would
                            only say that these bombings more than ever made it inevitable that
                            Hanoi would continue the war for as many years as might be
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> rehearsed his earlier
                            arguments, that Hanoi could not obtain a decision, U.S. could not be
                            forced out, escalation could only mean stepping up foreign activity
                            (U.S. and Chinese), north and south, and could threaten continuance of
                            U.S. policy of restraint in bombing.</p>
                        <pb n="370" xml:id="pg_370" facs="0402"/>
                        <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> then undertook to begin review
                            of positions reached by him and <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> in current talks. Said although we wide apart
                            there seemed to be somewhat less difference of opinion re withdrawal of
                            troops and unification. In reply <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> made point, new in these discussions, that U.S.
                            troops would have to be withdrawn before elections could take place. On
                            being pressed to state his own understanding of what he and <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> discussed he affirmed that “any final
                            solution would have to include (comporter) withdrawal of U.S. troops”,
                            but this time added that such withdrawal would have to precede
                            elections. He claimed it was <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> who
                            had introduced the idea of “stages” in conversation. (<persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> supplied the word but Rupert if
                            anything was ahead of him in endorsing the idea.)</p>
                        <p>15. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> did not say whether this
                            timing was acceptable to his friends but did repeat that U.S. wanted
                            fundamental rights of Vietnam as presented in Geneva Accords agreed.
                            U.S. wanted independent, unified, possibly non-aligned Vietnam, and were
                            willing to put our policy to the test, including free elections without
                            outside intervention. If U.S. troops withdrawn it could not be under
                            conditions which left other outside forces, i.e., Hanoi, free to
                            influence results.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> observed that <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> had not previously made this
                            point on withdrawals, and took occasion to observe that while Pham Van
                            Dong and Rusk interviews demonstrated awareness <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> conversations, Pham Van Dong had taken a harder
                            line while press widely commented on Rusk's determination to seek peace
                            and had even used phrase “de-escalation”.</p>
                        <p>16. As to reunification and <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName>'s
                            claim that he and <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>
                            seemed not too far apart, i.e., with respect to international decision
                            by free consultation, north and south, timing and supervision, <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> said Hanoi was not imposing
                            any decision on the south (meaning the “Front”). Therefore the timetable
                            would be as the south and north should agree. (<persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> again referred to fact that most South Vietnamese
                            probably did not want unification on Hanoi terms.)</p>
                        <p>17. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> to try to resume where he and
                                <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> stood. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> reviewed the positions he had
                            just taken on bombing, reunification, and claimed these represented no
                            change in his prior position. He confirmed that he had noticed in French
                            press account taken by Secretary Rusk and others of these discussions.
                            With reference to internal regime he again insisted on program of the
                            “Front”. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> again said it was
                            unrealistic to expect strongest power in the world to accept adversary
                            fiat on agenda, withdraw all its troops prior to negotiation, and accept
                            a priori installation of “Front” as sole negotiating agent and
                            government in south. Latter would certainly find a role to play in
                            national life and reconstruction and could also be included in North
                            Vietnamese delegation. (<persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>
                            sneered at latter idea.) If, as <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> claimed, Front represented everybody in south
                                <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> said they would be
                            triumphantly returned by elections. However, <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> doubted it.</p>

                        <p>18. Early in interview <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> had
                            indicated desirability of meeting next week and <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> agreed to Tuesday,<note n="6" xml:id="d133fn6">September 7. <persName corresp="#p_MVBR1">Mai Van

                                    <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> officials indicated that he

                                further meetings. Paul Sturm (“Y”), who replaced <persName corresp="#p_GES1">Gullion</persName>, had an unproductive
                                meeting with <persName corresp="#p_MVBR1">Mai Van Bo</persName> on

                        <p>At close of meeting <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> said he would
                            “retain” particularly two of <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>'s points, i.e., position that cessation of
                            bombing could not be conditioned on prior promise or performance by
                            Hanoi of counterpart undertaking, and point that withdrawal of foreign
                            troops must be completed before elections. He expressed obvious
                            reservations, but said he would reflect and consult on these points, and
                            confirmed meeting for Tuesday.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> said a further meeting
                            might be worthwhile if there were anything new, but said discussions
                            thus far had produced little that was new or useful. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> said he thought talks had taken a
                            “zig-zag” course and that last previous meeting had seemed
                            “constructive”. This clearly worried <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> who demanded confirmation that he had always
                            taken a consistent line.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">General impressions:</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> had stronger impression than
                            previously that <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> fearful
                            of getting out of line with Hanoi. <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName> obviously worried at implication that in current
                            talks he had ever veered. Indeed, he may already have done so in
                            appearing on earlier occasion to be too relaxed about timing of U.S.
                            troop withdrawals. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> suspects some
                            of <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>'s waverings reflect
                            difference within Hanoi Government, pulling and hauling with Front,
                            Chinese, etc.</p>
                        <p>Although on surface <persName corresp="#p_Rupert1">Rupert</persName>
                            position on halting bombing and on withdrawal U.S. troops seems notably
                            unfruitful, Washington may wish to consider whether a third party might
                            not be enlisted (not French) to receive from Hanoi assurances that if
                            bombing suspended there might be some action on the part of Hanoi; also
                            what would be time relation between withdrawal U.S. troops and: (a)
                            popular consultation with respect to unification, and (b) with respect
                            to voting on internal regime of South Vietnam, (c) convening of a
                            conference, (d) putting Geneva Accords into effect; also relation of
                            these measures to international control? Should we ask Rupert these
                            questions?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName>'s general impression is that
                            talks very unfruitful at this point and unless something gives difficult
                            to see beyond next one or two sessions. He thinks Hanoi does not want to
                            talk at this point. In a month's time it may be different.<note n="7" xml:id="d133fn7">The source text bears no signature.</note>

                                Saigon, September 1, the Department of State noted with concern the
                                Embassy's report that General <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName> believed that events in South Vietnam favored
                                his eventual ascension to power. The Department agreed entirely with
                                    <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>'s plan to
                                discourage <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName> since it
                                feared that the effects of further political instability in South
                                Vietnam would have serious consequences on U.S. and international
                                public opinion and could only disrupt the war effort against the
                                Viet Cong. The Department asked for the Embassy's assessment of
                                    <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName>'s chances and methods
                                of a possible takeover. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Prospect of fresh political instability in Saigon which Gen. <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName>'s ambition may represent is merely
                            most recent manifestation of long-term, well-known problem. It is, of
                            course, not related simply to Thi or any other individual. Since early
                            1963 political instability has been a fact of life here. It does not
                            arise or disappear because of failures or successes against Viet Cong,
                            but it is affected by the way the war goes and changes form accordingly.
                            Were the war to end under acceptable circumstances the problem would not
                            disappear. As the Viet Cong find themselves increasingly frustrated and
                            as Hanoi sees the path to military victory blocked, they may even come
                            to regard the possibility of political chaos and ineffective govt as
                            their best hope for ultimate success and increase their efforts in this
                            sphere accordingly. However, if we were to find ourselves on the
                            threshold of or involved in negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, they would hope to gain in such
                            negotiations by virtue of political weakness in the south what they
                            could not gain because of combined US-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military strength.</p>
                        <p>2. The Directorate govt has so far taken the line that there must be a
                            moratorium on political activity until the Communist threat has been
                            dealt with. Such a policy is unrealistic by itself, but when complicated
                            by the possible fragility of the unity of the Directorate, it becomes
                            even more probable that we face the danger of sudden opportunistic
                            political moves and unpredictable political change. It is in this
                            context that the evidence of <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName>'s ambition or the maneuvering of <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> must be examined.</p>
                        <p>3. Political instability has tended to fluctuate in intensity. Two weeks
                            ago the political pot began to bubble in Hue with mild anti-mobilization
                            demonstrations which developed an anti-government theme.<note n="3" xml:id="d134fn3">In telegram 724 from Saigon, September 2, the
                                Embassy reported on anti-government student demonstrations in Hue.

                            <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0405"/>But now, due to a variety of
                            factors, the intensity of opposition to the government and the
                            maneuverings of ambitious individuals seem for the moment to have been
                            checked. Moreover, the government's decision to establish a civilian
                            advisory council (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 737)<note n="4" xml:id="d134fn4">Dated September 3. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 15 VIET S)</note> could take some
                            of the political heat off the govt for the immediate future.</p>
                        <p>4. The Directorate has been operating in something resembling a political
                            vacuum when it comes to domestic politics, non-military power groupings,
                            and individual ambitions. One of <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nguyen
                                Khanh</persName>'s essential weaknesses was his failure to deal
                            effectively with non-military political elements and eventually they
                            brought him down. The new advisory council seems able [garble] on part
                            present <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to cope with such
                            elements.</p>
                        <p>5. With these introductory remarks in the broader context the more
                            specific comments requested in <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>
                            can be provided.</p>
                        <p>6. Given the personality of I Corps Commander, Brigadier General
                                <persName corresp="#p_NCT1">Nguyen Chanh Thi</persName>, it is
                            extremely difficult to predict with precision just how he might try to
                            make his move or even whether he will try. By common consent, among
                            those who have known him well, Thi is an extremely complex individual.
                            Low-born, he has always been quite aware of the poverty of his
                            antecedents. He has had little formal training outside the army. He is
                            acutely sensitive to this lack. His role in the coup manque of November
                            11, 1960 has been cast into doubt by those who contend that he was a
                            “late starter” who threw in his lot with coup when they seemed on the
                            verge of victory and broke violently with them in exile in Phnom Penh,
                            berating them for involving him in a lost cause. Exile cost him dearly
                            in terms of pride because he was forced to accept handouts and menial
                            jobs from those he considered inferior merely to live. During this
                            period his wife, in Viet-Nam, took up with another officer and left
                            him.</p>
                        <p>7. When <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName> returned to Viet-Nam
                            following coup of November 1, 1963, he felt that Military Revolutionary
                            Council owed him something in the way of promotion and reward in view of
                            his association with attempt of November 11, 1960 and his long exile.
                            But he was given his old rank and shipped off to I Corps. There he
                            associated himself with <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nguyen
                                Khanh</persName> who had himself been “late starter” in coup of Nov.
                            1, 1963. Through his old connections with the airborne brigade,
                                <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName> helped <persName corresp="#p_Khanh1">Khanh</persName> organize the coup of January
                            30.</p>
                        <p>8. In wake of January 30 coup, <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName>
                            found himself back in I Corps despite promises by <persName corresp="#p_Khanh1">Khanh</persName> that he was to be his “right
                            hand man” in Saigon. He was First Division Commander and much later he
                            rose to become Corps Commander.</p>
                        <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0406"/>
                        <p>9. At various times during past year <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName> has played controversial political role in I Corps.
                            One has only to recall embarrassment <persName corresp="#p_Khanh1">Khanh</persName> suffered at hands of hostile crowd in Hue the day
                            that a Ngo Dinh Can henchman, Phan Quang Dong, was executed. Such an
                            incident could not have transpired without sure foreknowledge permissive
                            attitude <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName>'s part. There was
                            also <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName>'s “hands off” attitude
                            on Hue demonstrations that led to downfall of <persName corresp="#p_Huong1">Huong</persName>. Embarrassment of <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName> during course visit to Hue just
                            after Directorate formed is another case in point.</p>
                        <p>10. There is no doubt that <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName> has
                            often thought of himself as a potential saviour of his country. These
                            thoughts have probably also been accompanied by grave doubt about his
                            real ability to govern the land. He seems genuinely convinced of his own
                            honesty and his determination to cope with corruption and bad government
                            (according to his own lights).</p>
                        <p>11. There seems little doubt <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri
                                Quang</persName> and his adherents have felt for some time that
                                <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName> was sympathetic and
                            usable. There was a certain identity of interest between them, but at
                            the same time there was also a certain condescension on the part of
                                <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> and company.
                            Probably some of the Hue group of intellectuals around <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> began talking about how
                                <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName> could be used. Whatever
                            the means by which he learned of it, <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName> appears fully aware of an effort to transform him
                            into a deus ex machina and he resents it.</p>
                        <p>12. Articles 10 and 15 of Constitutional Charter promulgated June 19<note n="5" xml:id="d134fn5">For text, see <hi rend="italic">American
                                    Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1965</hi>, pp.
                                880-883.</note> contain provisions for replacement of President of
                            Directorate and Prime Minister respectively. These articles are
                            concerned with death or incapacity, however, and not orderly succession
                            for other reasons. Either could, of course, be used to cover case where
                            either <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> resigned and withdrew. By-laws of
                            Congress of Armed Forces (reported in FVS-11,922)<note n="6" xml:id="d134fn6">Not found.</note> are more specific and deal with
                            such subjects as reprimands, no-confidence and replacement by
                            Directorate members. Thus legal machinery does exist for orderly and
                            peaceful transfer of power to <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName>
                            assuming all parties are agreeable. Nevertheless it is not a question of
                            legal procedures but more a problem of power groups and power plays that
                            will determine the end result.</p>
                        <p>13. In his conversations with Mission officer regarding his destiny, Thi
                            has come down on side of a peaceful and orderly transfer if he is to
                            take power. He has said on one occasion that he would hope that
                                <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>, on becoming aware of his
                            incapacity to lead, would turn to him and say, “I tried, now it's your
                            turn,” and quietly return to his air force. Such remarks by <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName> must be weighed carefully, because
                            they were meant for American consumption with full knowledge of our
                            anxiety that governmental stability be maintained. Given <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName>'s mercurial nature, one must <pb n="375" xml:id="pg_375" facs="0407"/>conclude that the circumstances
                            of the moment would determine whether he made his play within or outside
                            the framework of the existing government. In any event, were he to
                            assume either <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName>'s position
                            or <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>'s one would have to expect
                            many changes in personnel (<persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName>
                            has always wanted his own men around him), programs and probably even in
                            fundamental <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> policy.</p>
                        <p>14. It is our judgment that <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName>
                            would be seriously deficient in either military backing or popular
                            support were he to try and assume power. One can imagine a situation
                            developing within the Directorate itself through which he might be named
                            either Chairman or Prime Minister, but he would face virtually
                            insurmountable difficulties from outset in attempting to allay any broad
                            base support. Your judgment is accurate that there would be sharp
                            reaction within the northern Catholic refugee bloc. In addition, the
                            southern mass would probably find this impossible to stomach. His only
                            assets would probably be in the center and even these are uncertain if
                            he were unwilling to accept guidance from <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri
                                Quang</persName>. (<persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName> and

                        </list>
                        <p>In seeking possible ways of ending the insurgency in South Viet Nam, I
                            have noted with some concern that some of our best friends often
                            consider that at some early point in the procedure it would be desirable
                            or even essential to declare a “cease-fire”. Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> in his recent speech<note n="2" xml:id="d135fn2">The text of <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>'s September 1 speech to the Senate is in
                                    <hi rend="italic">The Congressional Record</hi>—Senate,
                                September 1, 1965, pp. 22560-22562.</note> bore down heavily on the
                            need for a cease-fire and a stand-fast which, he indicated, might start
                            at the outset of negotiations.</p>
                        <p>If the users of this word, cease-fire, mean it in the sense of a
                            cessation of all use of firearms, it is no more reasonable to talk of a
                            cease-fire in South Viet Nam than of one between police and criminals in
                            a crime-wave. The hostile acts of the Viet Cong which must be brought
                            under control—terrorism, sabotage, oppression of the rural population,
                            recruiting and infiltration—do not depend on the use of weapons. The
                            prevention of these acts by the government does. Hence, a cease-fire
                            without something else would give the Viet Cong the opportunity to
                            continue to harass the population, impress recruits, expand their areas
                            of control and prepare for greater depredations.</p>
                        <p>The “something else” which would have to be added to make the situation
                            tolerable from our point of view must include provisions for the
                            continued maintenance of law and order by government forces, at least
                            outside of those areas which might be conceded to be normally under Viet
                            Cong control. The government could offer to cease bombings and clearing
                            operations in these Red areas and, in exchange, the Viet Cong/Hanoi
                            would undertake to cease all incidents anywhere in South Viet Nam and
                            all infiltration from outside South Viet Nam. Our side should retain the
                            right of unarmed air reconnaissance of infiltration routes in North Viet
                            Nam and Laos.</p>
                        <p>In summary, instead of talking of a mutual cease-fire we should talk of a
                            cease-fire on our side in exchange for a cease-aggression on theirs. A
                            fair offer would be for our side to cease all bombing in North and South
                            Viet Nam, and all new clearing operations in Viet Cong held territory,
                            but <pb n="377" xml:id="pg_377" facs="0409"/>to retain the right to use
                            force to maintain law and order outside of specified Viet
                            Cong-controlled areas. Additionally, we might agree to freeze foreign
                            force levels but should retain the right of unarmed air reconnaissance
                            of infiltration routes in North Viet Nam and Laos. Their side would
                            cease all incidents in South Viet Nam and infiltration of men and
                            equipment in South Viet Nam. Both sides should have the right on short
                            notice to denounce the agreement for cause.</p>
                        <p>I believe that the foregoing discussion suggests how involved a cessation
                            of hostilities is in a guerrilla situation such as we have in South Viet
                            Nam. In many ways, the requirements are as demanding as for the
                            negotiating of a final peace settlement. Even, if achieved, the
                            agreement would be susceptible to breach without warning either by a
                            deliberate decision of the Communist leaders or by an act of
                            indiscipline or carelessness by any of the hundreds of thousands of
                            armed men on either side. All of these points need careful consideration
                            before we allow ourselves to become involved in a so-called cease-fire
                            which can be a trap.</p>

                            Staff outline a concept for the future conduct of the conflict in
                            Vietnam. In the proposed concept, the Joint Chiefs outline factors
                            bearing on the development of a US military strategy, discuss US
                            objectives, tasks, and basic strategy, and recommend principal measures
                            necessary for executing the basic strategy and for achieving US
                            objectives. The concept includes certain generalized courses of action
                            about which there would be little or no dispute and a number of other
                            courses that are clearly controversial and raise far-reaching policy
                            issues (e.g., blockade and mining of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, US build-up in Thailand, intensified <gloss target="#t_RT1">RT</gloss>).</p>

                            recommend that the concept be approved as the basis for subsequent
                            development of courses of action, forces and other requirements, to

                        <p>In my judgment, an over-all approval of the concept proposed by the

                        </list>
                        <p>On my return from leave I found that not much progress had been made with
                            respect to bombing policy in North Viet Nam. It may be useful, <pb n="379" xml:id="pg_379" facs="0411"/>therefore, for me to set out
                            briefly the proposition about which I talked with you two weeks
                                ago.<note n="2" xml:id="d137fn2">No record of this discussion has
                                been found.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Perhaps the most firmly based proposition about the use of airpower is
                            that its systematic and thorough application against a few target
                            systems is geometrically more effective than its diffuse application
                            against many target systems.</p>
                        <p>2. For this reason, there is little doubt that the most effective use of
                            airpower against North Viet Nam would be systematically to attack
                            certain target systems which are critical to the military supply and
                            production capabilities of that country. The two best candidates are:
                            oil storage and electric power. Although attacks on these target systems
                            need not be sanguinary in terms of civilian casualties, it is evident
                            that they raise issues which have led the President thus far to hold
                            off.</p>
                        <p>3. This fact does not relieve us of the responsibility of insuring that
                            the use of airpower against North Viet Nam, within present limits, is as
                            efficient as it can be made. At the present time, from the evidence
                            available, I believe our attacks on North Viet Nam suffer from excessive
                            diffusion of effort with respect to target systems. We are attacking
                            ammunition dumps; barracks; some accessible power stations and oil
                            storage depots; transport targets; etc. The indecisive character of the
                            results is suggested by the analyses of the effectiveness of our
                            bombing. They indicate that we have damaged or destroyed a modest
                            proportion of each target system (roughly 5-20%).</p>
                        <p>4. I propose, therefore, that while keeping open the question of an
                            optimum use of airpower (i.e., systematic attack, including targets near
                            Hanoi, on oil storage and electric power), we devote ourselves forthwith
                            to a transport interdiction campaign with the objectives of:</p>
                        <p>—isolating Hanoi from the Laos and South Viet Nam borders;</p>
                        <p>—isolating particular regions of southern and western North Viet Nam from
                            each other and from Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>5. This judgment is based on ample evidence that our transport attacks in
                            North Viet Nam are producing a series of substantial effects on the
                            military and civil economy, as well as on psychological and political
                            morale; but there is also evidence that the lack of system and
                            follow-through in those attacks is denying us their full
                            potentialities.</p>
                        <p>6. To do this we must establish, by careful analysis, the 50 or so
                            critical transport bottlenecks in North Viet Nam and make a maximum
                            commitment of force to hold those cuts, if possible, by night as well as
                            by day. In turn, this would require that we permit the use of our full
                            sortie capabilities against this transport target system, dropping, if
                            necessary, <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0412"/>attacks on target
                            systems of doubtful or lesser value—perhaps barracks and ammunition
                            dumps.</p>
                        <p>7. No guarantee concerning results can, of course, be made. But a careful
                            reading of the evidence suggests that the transport system of North Viet
                            Nam has been rendered so vulnerable by bombing up to the present point
                            that such a truly systematic interdiction effort might not only make
                            even small military movements across the North Vietnamese borders
                            impractical but also produce significant economic, social, and political
                            consequences.</p>
                        <p>7. [sic] The adoption of such a program would make urgent an effort which
                            is not lacking in our government; namely, a sophisticated and systematic
                            effort to evaluate from all sources the various different military and
                            civilian effects being imposed by our bombing in the North.</p>
                        <p>8. A related transport interdiction system should be considered for
                            concurrent or later application; namely, the interdiction of Hanoi from
                            external sources of supply. This system involves the cutting (and
                            holding of cuts) in the rail and road system between Hanoi and the
                            Chicom borders and the mining of Haiphong harbor. A government in Hanoi
                            isolated from its own borders and hinterland and from regular flows of
                            external supplies is likely to take a relatively dim view of its
                            prospects, while still retaining its hard-won industrial and urban
                            infrastructure.</p>

                        <p>The range and complexity of our non-military activities are
                            noteworthy—from training village policemen to controlling inflation. The
                                <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381" facs="0413"/>key elements of this
                            comprehensive program are touched on briefly below.</p>
                        <p>Security and Political Operations. An ambitious internal security program
                            is concentrating on building national, provincial and Special Branch
                            police forces. Recruiting, training and equipping a force of almost
                            80,000 men is proceeding on schedule. Important steps have also been
                            taken to improve techniques of population control; 7 million identity
                            cards have been issued and population checkpoints have been established.
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>-trained counter-guerrilla units
                            are operating against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in its own
                            territory.</p>
                        <p>The objective of attracting popular support for the Saigon government
                            permeates the full range of programs involved in the counterinsurgency
                            effort. <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> has attempted to
                            project an image of revolutionary reform, but promises have only been
                            slowly fulfilled, and the lack of effective government ties into the
                            villages has dulled the impact of <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>'s revolutionary fervor.</p>
                        <p>The Mission is encouraging <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> to
                            give concrete meaning to his program and to build support for it among
                            the various elements of Vietnamese society. In theory these groups
                            welcome <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>'s objectives, but his
                            defensive attitude and the problem of enlisting the support of one group
                            without alienating another inhibit greater progress.</p>
                        <p>On the level of local action, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has
                            trained and equipped various types of small, highly motivated teams
                            which operate throughout the provinces, applying Viet Cong tactics of
                            living and working with the villagers.</p>
                        <p>The Mission is working with all important political groups to sublimate
                            their deeply embedded historic frictions and encourage their joint
                            effort to defeat the Viet Cong. There is greater covert than overt room
                            for maneuver and programming in this field and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has initiated programs to convince both leaders and
                            rank and file that only through cooperation and concentration on
                            prosecuting the war can they avoid Communist domination and realize
                            their respective objectives. The evolution of a national program which
                            can attract their collective energies and subordinate their self-serving
                            interests remains essential if greater progress is to be achieved.</p>
                        <p>Provincial Operations—Ex Security. The comprehensive military-civilian
                            operation in the Hop Tac area surrounding Saigon has shown progress. The
                            political situation is stable except in Hau Nghia Province where <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military interference with the Province
                            Chief's operations and instances of indiscriminate shelling have
                            alienated some of the local population.</p>
                        <p>The refugee problem continues to be serious, although not critical except
                            in the overcrowded camps at Qui Nhon where additional housing <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382" facs="0414"/>is being built. Through the

                        <p>Economic and Social Operations. Economic assistance programs are giving
                            priority to countering the growing threat of inflation, meeting serious
                            logistic problems created by Viet Cong interdiction of land routes, and
                            developing tactics for combatting Viet Cong economic subversion.</p>

                            most progress in the Delta and Saigon areas. There is special priority
                            for establishing a light industry complex and creating a planned
                            community in the Cam Ranh Bay area where a major port and U.S. military
                            base are being constructed.</p>
                        <p>Emphasis is being placed on improving medical facilities in the provinces
                            and increasing the number of surgical suites staffed by U.S. and other

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has initiated some limited new

                            still moving cautiously because of landlord sensitivities, at least the
                            initial step has been taken after a long period of inactivity in this
                            important area.</p>
                        <p>Psychological Warfare and Information. <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> propaganda directed at North Vietnam has increased
                            considerably with the expansion of Voice of America Vietnamese language
                            service and the initiation of extensive leaflet drops.</p>
                        <p>Propaganda and psychological operations in South Vietnam have also
                            expanded and grown more effective with the buildup of U.S. information
                            personnel.</p>
                        <p>U.S. troop orientation programs are attempting to reduce potential causes
                            of friction between U.S. troops and the Vietnamese. There have been
                            instances of friction in urban areas near U.S. military installations;
                            there does not seem to be much of a problem in the countryside.</p>

                        <p>Veterans benefits programs for the Vietnamese military are being
                            developed to improve morale and sustain their commitment to the war
                            effort and a non-Communist Vietnam.</p>

                            necessity for an effective external information program are now bearing
                            fruit. Pamphlets and other materials have been produced for foreign
                            distribution; newly recruited personnel for assignment abroad are being
                            trained; foreign correspondents, at long last, are being briefed by
                            Saigon spokesmen. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is focusing on
                            better diplomatic representation abroad; agrement has been requested for

                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Bombing policy</hi>. Bob McNamara is eager to get
                            general guidance for the next few weeks on bombing in North Vietnam. As
                            you know, he is engaged in a running discussion with the Chiefs on this
                            subject. His own view is that we should continue with carefully measured
                            attacks on clearly defined military targets that do not take us into the
                            Hanoi-Haiphong area, or into direct engagement of Migs, IL-28s, or the
                                <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>-site systems as a whole. (<gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> sites outside the Hanoi-Haiphong area
                            would remain targets of opportunity, as I understand it.) The wider
                            recommendations of the Chiefs have been referred back for additional
                                study.<note n="4" xml:id="d139fn4">See <ref target="#d136fn3">footnote 3, Document 136</ref>.</note>

                        <p>Yesterday Dean Rusk felt that while the present pattern of bombing should
                            certainly continue, we should not extend it, as Bob initially suggested,
                            into the part of North Vietnam which is northeast of Hanoi. Bob accepted
                            this advice, and I think the targets he will put forward will be
                            acceptable to Dean. It was also agreed that there would be a further
                            study of target systems in North Vietnam, with the thought that a more
                            sophisticated analysis may permit selection of target systems that would
                            hurt the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> a lot more, without
                            increasing civilian casualties. It was agreed that the target selection
                            so far has not had this level of sophistication.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Diplomatic situation.</hi> We had an extended
                            discussion also of the diplomatic situation. On this you must be
                            psychic. I told you yesterday that the Ruppert discussions<note n="5" xml:id="d139fn5">Reference is to the informal conversations between
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MVBR1">Mai Van Bo</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GES1">Edmund Gullion</persName>; see <ref target="#d112">Document 112</ref>.</note> were continuing. But
                            the fact is that Ruppert cancelled a meeting scheduled for last Tuesday,
                            and <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> has come home. <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> got the feeling at his last meeting
                            that Ruppert had been called up short, and that there might even be
                            someone watching from behind a curtain which had been drawn for the
                            first time across a doorway in the meeting room. Ruppert carefully drew
                            back from one or two marginal positions taken in earlier talks, and even
                            insisted that he had never taken those positions.</p>
                        <p>In this situation, there is general agreement that we ought not now to
                            look as if we were very eager for more talks, and we are inclined to
                            keep <persName corresp="#p_X1">X</persName> at home and show no
                            eagerness for further probes in the next few weeks. We will need your
                            judgment on this also.</p>
                        <p>(Discussion of this matter on Monday will be indirect and fuzzy because
                            Red Raborn is not currently a member of the Ruppert club—and I doubt if
                            he should be cut in right now unless for some reason you want him to
                            be.)</p>
                        <p>At the same time that we suspend private diplomatic probing, we think
                            that we should adopt a public posture that our position on negotiations
                            is now totally clear and that the next move is up to the Communists.

                            leaks to <persName corresp="#p_RJB1">Reston</persName> and Nixon, we are
                            inclined to agree with his assessment and to feel that we now have a
                            perfectly good public posture which does not need to be regilded every
                            day. I take it from our phone conversation yesterday that this is your
                            own general view.</p>
                        <p>Our most difficult and inconclusive discussions turned on the actual
                            program within Vietnam. Our common guess is that the Viet Cong will try
                            to avoid major engagements with our forces and that they will be quite
                            successful in doing so. In this situation, Rusk raised the question
                            whether we really need to move up toward 200,000 men. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            <pb n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0417"/>continues to feel that we do,
                            and I agree. The problem is to make sure that the role of our troops is
                            so understood that neither the country nor the troops themselves get
                            frustrated if the scene of major action shifts toward smaller terrorist
                            activities in which our troops cannot play the dominant role.</p>
                        <p>We finally agreed that we should ask <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> for a general assessment of the prospects
                            for the next few months in this area. We seem to have got past the big
                            monsoon dangers, and we need to be sure that we have an agreed program
                            for the continuing contest of pacification. We will not have anything
                            sharp to report tomorrow morning, but you should know that all of us
                            feel that this is the most important area of effort for the coming weeks
                            and months.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> informed the President
                            that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> had recommended the bombing
                            of <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> sites, airfields having IL-28s
                            and other targets in areas previously restricted around Hanoi and
                            Haiphong and close to the Chinese border. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he considered this a significant
                            escalation of war against North Viet Nam and believed that it was
                            premature for the President to consider or act upon any such
                            recommendation until we had a better feel for the likelihood of North
                            Vietnamese use of IL-28s and the North Vietnamese and Chicom reaction to
                            any such action. Rusk agreed with <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> also recommended that certain <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0418"/>other targets be hit. Rusk was worried
                            about hitting two bridges between Hanoi and the Communist Chinese border
                            indiscriminately and recommended that the action with respect to each of
                            those bridges be limited to one day. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed with Rusk and the President approved

                            that he would be back to the President, after study by Adm. <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName>, with a more fully considered

                        <p>753. Eyes only Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>1. Informal high-level review over weekend of Vietnam situation leaves us
                            with feeling situation has more major uncertainties, variables, and
                            possibly occasions for changes in our actions than for some time past.
                            Purpose this message is to give you feel of our thinking and of
                            questions we see becoming acute.</p>
                        <p>2. Seems likely increasing US ground strength is driving Hanoi/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to avoid major unit actions and in effect
                            revert to pattern of placing primary emphasis on small-scale actions.
                            Quite possibly we may be faced with <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            tactics of prolonged small-scale struggle in which they will rely on
                            international pressures and their doubtless exaggerated view of our
                            internal political opposition to bring about eventual reduction in our
                            effort, while they also hope and work for adverse internal political
                            developments in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. In combating such
                            prolonged tactics we need to consider just how we propose to use our
                            greatly increased ground and air<pb n="387" xml:id="pg_387" facs="0419"/> strength, especially the degree to which it can and should be
                            employed in any wider countryside efforts beyond necessarily slow
                            securing efforts close to our base areas.<note n="2" xml:id="d141fn2">In
                                the September 12 draft, McGeorge Bundy changed the phrase “extending
                                perhaps eventually up to 30-50 miles from our base areas” to read as
                                it does at this point. He also added the subsequent sentence in the
                                parentheses.</note> (We also question whether and how we can move
                            from patrolling to real pacification in these areas—can <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> police take advantage of our nearby strength for this
                            purpose in these areas?) There is even a residual question whether
                            further increases in strength at presently planned pace are wise, or
                            whether we should in some small degree defer further increases.
                            Obviously one crucial element in this is <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> popular
                            reaction to more extensive US ground operations, and on this subject we
                            would welcome your over-all and up-to-date assessment. In short, if we
                            move rapidly up in force strength, question is bound to arise of
                            effective employment these forces and exactly what concept and strategy
                            we should follow against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> lie-low
                            tactics.</p>
                        <p>3. Related question concerns scale and effective employment and
                            continuing evaluation of results of presently planned massive further
                            increase in air strike capacity. On this we have noted <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>'s excellent directive
                            concerning civilian implications of operations,<note n="3" xml:id="d141fn3">On September 7, <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> issued <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> Directive 525-3 prescribing guidelines designed to
                                minimize non-combatant battle casualties. (Johnson Library, National
                                Security File, Country File, Vietnam, Vol. XL)</note> but still feel
                            there is need for better over-all analysis of operations and for some
                            mechanism to evaluate operations currently from all standpoints. One
                            possibility would be to find civilian and military people akin to those
                            who did operations analysis in World War II to act as survey group
                            either on one-shot or continuing basis. Obviously, this too is matter
                            you have under continuing close study, and we need to know your
                                thoughts.<note n="4" xml:id="d141fn4">In the draft, the phrase
                                originally read: “exchange our thoughts.”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. As to pacification/reconstruction effort, we wonder whether time is
                            not fast approaching, or already here, when <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces freed by US deployments could put far more steam
                            into Hop Tac and perhaps other key pacification areas where efforts have
                            been pretty much stalled because of force shortage and general security
                            situation. This might involve selecting provinces for really planned and
                            systematic extension of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> control with
                            firm allotment of necessary military forces, plus police and all other
                            elements of effort. In this connection, we would like for you to develop
                            specific plan for our joint consideration involving concentration of
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces on pacification and
                            reliance on US forces to handle large <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            actions. What areas would be chosen for pacification; when could the
                            plan be started and what objectives would be set; how <pb n="388" xml:id="pg_388" facs="0420"/>many <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces would be required, where and when; how many US
                            forces would be required, where and when; etc?<note n="5" xml:id="d141fn5">Not marked as excised in the September 12 draft,

                            is next military question. Our inclination is to extend strike program
                            very gradually into area northeast of Hanoi, stressing key targets on
                            northeast rail line and limited number other valid military targets.
                            This would be without stepping up over-all number of strikes per week,
                            but might be accompanied by some intensification armed recce

                            area roughly up to 20th parallel. We are still inclined not to hit
                            Hanoi/Haiphong targets or to take actions that would have major chance

                            have taken it far enough to make abundantly clear in all reasonable
                            quarters that it is Hanoi, and especially Peiping, who are the obstacles
                            to peace. Obviously, we shall have to reiterate our position in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> debate, and may have to respond to
                            further third country initiatives, although the field is happily fairly
                            clear at the moment. But we agree we do not need to add to the record or
                            to state our position further except in response to clear need.</p>

                        <p>We have considered the Joint Chiefs of Staff's proposed Rolling Thunder
                            32/33 program for 17-30 September. That program would implement
                            immediately a major, concentrated effort of air strikes against North
                            Vietnam's Phuc Yen and four other Hanoi/Haiphong airfields, against rail
                            and highway routes and traffic between Hanoi and Haiphong, against rail
                            and highway arteries and traffic between Hanoi/Haiphong and China,
                            against four thermal power plants generating nearly 50% of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>'s thermal power, and against <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> installations which defend the above
                            areas.</p>
                        <p>At this date I am not persuaded by the reasoning of <gloss target="#t_JCSM1">JCSM</gloss> 670-65<note n="2" xml:id="d142fn2">In

                            proposal.</p>
                        <p>There is doubt whether the proposed program will mean a net advantage to
                                US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> operations within South
                            Vietnam. For example,<pb n="390" xml:id="pg_390" facs="0422"/> while the
                                <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> targets proposed in northeast
                            North Vietnam all relate to interdiction of war materials into North
                            Vietnam and therefore add to our efforts to interdict the flow of
                            materials out of North Vietnam into South Vietnam, the intelligence
                            estimates have been that such US strikes may well lead to a more
                            vigorous effort by the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> in support of
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in South Vietnam. And the
                            estimates have been that strikes of the kind proposed by the Joint
                            Chiefs would not at this time significantly injure the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> ability to persevere in the South or
                            persuade the Hanoi Government that the price of persisting was
                            unacceptably high.</p>
                        <p>More important is the risk of a US-Chinese confrontation, which could
                            well be increased by a program of the kind proposed. I am acutely aware
                            that it is possible that US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces
                            at Da Nang may be subjected to air attack by North Vietnam's eight
                            IL-28s (and perhaps <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss> 15/17s). The
                            intelligence judgment, however, has been that such an attack is
                            unlikely, largely because of the fear of widespread and large-scale
                            retaliation on North Vietnam by the United States. The judgment has been
                            that such a DRV attempt to strike in the South might be triggered by a
                                US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> strike against the
                            Hanoi/Haiphong area, and that there is a substantial risk that a strike
                            program of the weight recommended would induce the Chinese Communists to
                            intervene in the air from Chinese bases.</p>
                        <p>It has been decided therefore that:</p>
                        <p>1. The Rolling Thunder program proposed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff for
                            the period 17-30 September will not be approved at this time.</p>

                                that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam would probably be more

                                targets than it had been in the past. The Bureau of Intelligence and
                                Research of the Department of State dissented fundamentally from
                                this estimate, and its dissent is included in the <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss>.

                            opportunity for spearheading a national political revolution against

                            discussing with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Program envisages providing adequate care, temporary housing to refugees
                            who will be immediately organized into self-governing units (essentially
                            their own former village organization) and trained in processes of
                            democracy while undergoing rehabilitation. Men of military age will
                            receive paramilitary training for village defense with maximum effort
                            through Chieu Hoi surrenderee program to secure return of those men
                            (often the majority of those villages in refugee areas) still under Viet

                            role in all aspects of refugee program in zones of American
                            influence.</p>
                        <p>Objective of program (in coordination with military progress) is to send

                            monolithic solidarity within the armed [forces].</p>
                        <p>4. Military.</p>
                        <p>The lull in large-scale Viet Cong activity continued with the Viet Cong
                            apparently going through a period of realignment of their units and
                            re-evaluation of their plans.</p>
                        <p>5. Economic.</p>
                        <p>End of the month rice stores in both Saigon and the Delta dipped to lower
                            levels and the previous favorable decline in Saigon rice price was
                            arrested. Since recent rice arrivals have been delivered to Danang, the
                            supply situation in Saigon remains a matter of concern. Expected rice
                            shipment in the next fortnight should relieve the situation.</p>
                        <p>6. Psychological.</p>
                        <p>Editorials in the Vietnamese language press were marked by optimism on
                            the course of the war.</p>
                        <p>7. Negotiations.</p>
                        <p>(1)Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> is quoted
                            by the Associated Press under a September 12 dateline as saying that an
                            honorable peace “can only be achieved by negotiation premised on the
                            principles of self-determination”.</p>
                        <p>(2) If Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> is
                            correctly quoted, then I would like respectfully to disagree for reasons
                            set forth in my letter to you of August 31.<note n="3" xml:id="d143fn3">
                                <ref target="#d131">Document 131</ref>.</note> I am positive that
                            negotiation is certainly not the “only way”, and I believe that under
                            certain circumstances it may not be the best way.</p>
                        <p>(3) To the points of my letter of August 31, let me add the following
                            thoughts which have occurred to me upon further reflection:</p>
                        <p>(A) To maintain that the purpose of our military operations is to bring
                            about “unconditional negotiations” puts a floor under the risks which
                            the Communists run. If they know that they can always get to the
                            conference table they have the initiative in setting the time and the
                            terms for negotiations and thus they will have every incentive to
                            continue military operations.</p>
                        <p>(B) When considering the word “negotiations”, one must never forget that
                            the Communists will not enter negotiations with any intention of
                            “settling” anything, but with the aim of winning at the conference table
                            the prize which eluded them on the battlefield. One thing is absolutely
                            certain: there can be no hope of negotiating them out of anything that
                                <pb n="393" xml:id="pg_393" facs="0425"/>they hold on the ground.
                            They will strive not for stability, but for victory, and by then the
                            contest will be largely psychological.</p>
                        <p>(C) I am, of course, not opposed to negotiations in principle, provided
                            we have a clear and sagacious program, but we must recognize that
                            negotiations begin a new phase of the struggle rather than mark the end
                            of the old phase. Stakes remain extremely high and the conduct of
                            affairs grows more complicated, because it depends on so many
                            intangibles. Negotiations, therefore, require as careful and thoughtful
                            preparation as do our military campaigns.</p>

                        <p>Para 1</p>
                        <p>Agree with your feeling situation has more imponderables than usual.
                            While US military presence appears to have blunted <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> offensive, improved Vietnamese morale and
                            given us great opportunity, exploiting this opportunity depends upon
                            climate of mutual trust and confidence with young, inexperienced and
                            highly sensitive government facing complicated political problems.</p>
                        <p>Para 2</p>
                        <p>A. Agree with you that increasing US ground strength may be driving
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to avoid major unit actions and to
                            place primary emphasis on small scale actions. These must be dealt with
                            successfully by the Vietnamese themselves making the main effort in
                            conducting a combined politico-military campaign. The presence of
                            American troops does provide the opportunity for thorough pacification
                            of the areas in which they are stationed and full advantage should be
                            taken of this opportunity. It is<pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0426"/> a very big dividend from our investment of men and money. For
                            example, the Third Marine Division has scored impressive successes
                            north, south and west of Danang, while the police in the city of Danang
                            itself were doing a mediocre job. As I reported in another
                                telegram,<note n="3" xml:id="d144fn3">Not identified.</note> I
                            directed that the <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> police advisor
                            concentrate entirely on the city of Danang.</p>
                        <p>B. In this connection, consider the case of 1st Lt. Paul Ek, USMC, who
                            commands a joint action company consisting of 60 Americans and 150
                            Vietnamese in Phu Bai. They are causing somewhat of a sensation in
                            cleaning out the Viet Cong and, by their able political conduct,
                            increasing the intelligence “take”. If our American troops can emulate
                            this performance (and many are doing so now) in the ratio of 60 to 150,
                            ought to get a tremendous amount of small unit nighttime effective
                            pacification, and we would be neglecting an opportunity not to use
                            American troops for this purpose, thereby pacifying the country and
                            transforming the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>, making it into a
                            much more vital and effective element of Vietnamese society, able at
                            some not too remote date to carry on by themselves without outside
                            help.</p>
                        <p>C. General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> has had
                            under continuous study how he would use the increased ground and air
                            strength; in fact, the determination of his Phase I troop request was
                            based on a detailed analysis. The strategy and tactics that he
                            contemplates employing have been discussed in detail with the Vietnamese
                                <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> and a <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> concept paper is published for the guidance of US
                            commanders. This policy publication is being forwarded by <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> through military channels.<note n="4" xml:id="d144fn4">The <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> Concept
                                Paper, August 30, is in <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>

                            <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> feels strongly that
                            the full Phase I troop list should be deployed in accordance with the
                            schedule worked out in Honolulu in August. It is noted that the 1st
                            Division has been alerted but no public announcement has been made for
                            its deployment. We believe this division should be deployed on schedule.
                            In close coordination with the Vietnamese High Command, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> proposes to
                            follow the following broad strategy:</p>
                        <p>1. Halt the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> offensive—stem the
                            tide.</p>
                        <p>2. Resume the offensive—destroy <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> units
                            where they can be found and pacify selected high priority areas.</p>
                        <p>3. Restore progressively the entire country to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> control.</p>
                        <p>4. Support “rural construction” with comprehensive attention to the
                            pacification process as regards regional and popular force units, the
                            police, and the relationship therein between US and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> regular forces. Emphasis should be
                            accorded the role of civic action of which a police precinct program is
                            a necessary prerequisite. Appreciation and support of political and
                            psychological requirements would be stressed.</p>
                        <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395" facs="0427"/>
                        <p>5. It is assumed that the air campaign will continue against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and infiltration routes in Laos.</p>
                        <p>D. We need sufficient strength to insure the success of our strategy and
                            tactics. As we succeed it becomes more difficult for the Viet Cong to
                            marshal main-force units and the pressure will be on them to withdraw
                            such units to more remote areas and/or to transform themselves into
                            small units. This is a considerable triumph for us, because it means
                            that the US presence has in effect fragmented the main force, prevented
                            it from coming into being, or at least has forced it to play a lesser
                            role. We will have kept the main force from becoming more akin to a
                            regular army with which the enemy hoped to conquer the country
                            militarily and without which he surely cannot do so. We will have to
                            keep up the pressure on the main force whenever and wherever it appears
                            to prevent its resurgence on a large scale.</p>
                        <p>E. General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> and I are
                            intensively studying the question of “what concept and strategy we
                            should follow against VC lie-low tactics”. With our bases secure and
                            aggressive action against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            concentrations keeping them under pressure and off-balance, the lie-low
                            tactics that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> may adopt become more
                            a problem for police-and-social-action-type program. We would expect to
                            urge Vietnamese to use the police in the cities, and police-type
                            operation by military forces working out from thoroughly pacified
                            centers to pacify the environs as the basic element in what the
                            Vietnamese call “rural construction”. We are already discussing with the
                            Vietnamese the possibility of singling out areas that look like good
                            prospects, that are potentially pretty much over on our side, and then
                            pacifying them so as to get a little smell of across-the-board success
                            in the air.</p>
                        <p>F. I also think it is prudent to expect increased <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> terrorism, attempts to overthrow the government and
                            economic warfare.</p>
                        <p>G. We have had no unfavorable <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> reactions of significance to
                            more extensive US ground operations. Government leaders have made clear
                            their support for our efforts and their desire that we continue. While
                            personal, psychological and economic frictions can arise, there is no
                            evidence that these negative factors now outweigh the positive factors.
                            Our buildup and activity have convinced the Vietnamese that we do not
                            intend to pull out, which has been a nagging fear. Our efforts have
                            contributed to the belief that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            cannot win and have raised national morale and confidence in the success
                            of the anti-Communist struggle. There are many variables at work and it
                            is hard to predict how long this favorable attitude will continue or
                            whether CQ [<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>?] may possibly diminish.
                            In the near future we do not expect unfavorable attitudes of any great
                            significance. We are keeping our collective ears to the ground.</p>

                            concerning minimizing battlefield non-combatant casualties.<note n="5" xml:id="d144fn5">See <ref target="#d141fn3">footnote 3, Document

                            <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> feels and I agree
                            that an outsider survey group is not needed at this time. He believes
                            that he is able to translate recent experience into improved methods. He
                            has in his J-3 office a Requirements and Analysis Division which is
                            manned with well qualified officers who devote their entire time to
                            operational studies and analysis of force utilization and requirements.
                            They consult with the civilian elements of the Mission. He will be quick
                            to ask for help when he feels the need.</p>
                        <p>Para 4</p>
                        <p>A. I have directed the US Mission Liaison Group to grapple with needed
                            actions in this whole area, which it is starting to do most actively.
                            Also, fine early progress by the staff was made through informal liaison
                            with Minister Ung, Secretary-General of the Council of Rural
                            Construction (Pacification), with the Prime Minister's staff, and with
                            key technicians in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> Ministries
                            participation in pacification. The unexpected death of Minister Ung in
                            an Air Vietnam crash Thursday<note n="6" xml:id="d144fn6">September
                                16.</note> suddenly has imposed a whole new set of circumstances.
                            Meanwhile, the improvement of Hop Tac operations is receiving priority
                            attention now, including my discussing this with General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> and making a personal visit to the
                            Hop Tac area on Thursday morning.<note n="7" xml:id="d144fn7">September
                                23.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>B. I am not ready to say, “what areas would be chosen for pacification,
                            when could the plan be started, what objectives would be set,” but hope
                            to be able to do so soon. I am now encouraging General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> to concentrate <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> efforts and enthusiasm on pacification
                            so that this can have sustained, wholehearted <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> participation. This will permit development of
                            realistic requirements for our planning.</p>
                        <p>C. On the military side of the questions raised in para 4, <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> informs me that a
                            campaign plan is being refined by his staff in coordination with the
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. A first phase schedule of
                            operations has been agreed to between himself and General <persName corresp="#p_Co1">Co</persName>. Further, a study by <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> is now in progress for the purpose of reviewing AB 139
                            of 25 December 1964<note n="8" xml:id="d144fn8">Not further
                                identified.</note> (this concerns the roles and missions of the
                            various elements of the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>) and the
                            Chien Thang plan (<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> pacification plan)
                            to bring them in line with the campaign plan. I believe these efforts
                                are<pb n="397" xml:id="pg_397" facs="0429"/> responsive to what you
                            have in mind; however this can be better determined after you are
                            briefed on <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>'s plans. In this
                            connection, <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>'s J-3,
                            Brigadier General <persName corresp="#p_DPMGWE1">Depuy</persName>, is
                            going to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> for a conference
                            the last week of this month and thence to Washington for two weeks
                            leave. <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> states that
                            he will be available with appropriate charts and maps to brief the
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> if such is agreed to by <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> following the Honolulu meeting.
                            In this connection the main purpose of the Honolulu military meeting is
                            to allow <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> to present
                            his Phase II troop deployment concept. The Mission Council is being
                            briefed on this subject by <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> on Sept
                            21.</p>
                        <p>Para 5</p>
                        <p>Development of popular electoral processes from the rice roots up is part
                            of all our current planning for counter subversion/terrorism in “rural
                            construction” (pacification). For example, this has been taken into
                            account in developing temporary refugee status within rural communities
                            which have fled to safe zones pending their return home. I have also
                            been talking with General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> about
                            making use of provincial councils elected last May 30 in their further
                            election of delegates to Consultative National Council which also will
                            be given further task of commencing draft of new Constitution. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has made progress on land reform and is
                            giving increased emphasis to Chieu Hoi. But in this connection I cannot
                            believe it would be prudent to call a halt to military operations
                            anywhere.</p>
                        <p>Para 6</p>
                        <p>Appreciate what you say about the “negotiating front”.</p>
                        <p>Para 7</p>
                        <p>On the internal political front, we have had a period of relative quiet
                            ever since my arrival. I am studying extraordinary measures to protect
                            ourselves from a coup and hope that with the passage of time and with
                            our advice plus his own natural aptitude, General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> can become a really effective
                            political leader. The present leadership is sufficiently “young and
                            energetic”, but I agree that the problem is to maintain its cohesion and
                            gain more positive popular support.</p>
                        <p>Para 8</p>
                        <p>Hope you will keep Honolulu date open for a while, as it may be that late
                            October would be bad from the standpoint of the work here and that
                            mid-November would be better.</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> Executive Session with SecDef
                                and Deputy SecDef, 20 Sep 65, 1400 hours</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. This was the first of the regular Monday meetings in executive session
                            with only the Chiefs present initiated by the Chairman for better
                            communication between the Chiefs and SecDef. At the conclusion all the
                            Chiefs felt it had been one of the most useful meetings.</p>
                        <p>2. The SecDef doubted that there was a need for more air power in
                            Vietnam. He wondered if some of the air effort was not wasted. The
                            Chairman indicated that <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> had set up a group to study this.</p>
                        <p>3. The SecDef wondered what lies ahead for US troops. Based on the thesis
                            that a moderately successful blunting of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> Monsoon strategy has occurred, it would appear doubtful
                            that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> would make sustained attacks
                            for the next three to six months. What strategy will VC use? Will they
                            go to small-scale operations, and if so how do we combat it? The Marines
                            favor an oil spot strategy, expanding their enclaves gradually to hook
                            them together to keep the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> from getting
                            the rice in the coastal plain, mingling with the population there; at
                            the same time training Regional Forces and Popular Forces to take over.
                            SecDef wonders how we hasten this process. It was pointed out that
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>'s concept for
                            US forces would prevent main force concentrations; combination of US and
                                <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> forces to attack main force
                            sanctuaries that had been in existence for 25 years, move in and drive
                            them out, then police by <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>. Do away
                            with the sanctuaries. At the same time build up <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> forces. There should be a day when US forces should
                            leave the country. By the end of October we need a plan, a strategy. The
                            Chairman noted that <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>
                            has developed a strategy and a plan in conjunction with the senior
                            Vietnam leadership and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>.</p>
                        <p>4. The Secretary of Defense spoke with regard to the next Rolling
                            Thunder, indicating some fixed targets have not been too useful, that
                            fixed targets should be somewhat extended to interdiction in the
                            northwest rail and road lines, increasing slowly with no dramatic
                            impact.</p>
                        <p>5. The matter of air defense should be reviewed by the Army and Air
                            Force.</p>
                        <p>6. The SecDef concluded with a talk about leaks on security. He pointed
                            out the many times he had gone into this, including some investigations
                                <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0431"/>he had had, which really
                            produced no substantial results, but he urged everyone to look into this
                            again, maybe with a new group, to see what could be done. He pointed out
                            that some leaks had probably resulted in increased casualties for the US
                            and he wished it could be stopped.</p>
                        <p>7. In leaving he mentioned that he would like to have one of the Chiefs
                            go to Vietnam about each quarter. It was pointed out that General
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName> is going in
                            October and General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>
                            plans to be there at Christmastime.</p>

                        <p>1. Political-psychological</p>
                        <p>A. The Govt of Vietnam has finished its twelfth week of stability—a
                            rather astonishing fact which I attribute in large part to the
                            conviction that the U.S. is truly committed to staying as long as is
                            necessary and to doing whatever is necessary to ward off the Viet Cong
                            aggression. This conviction is created by the U.S. combat presence on
                            the ground.</p>
                        <p>B. The above statement is impossible to prove, but some unusually well
                            informed and sagacious persons believe it. In other words, your decision
                            on troops is not only a great thing militarily, but is paying big
                            dividends politically.</p>
                        <p>C. Let us hope that this stability continues, and I try to leave no stone
                            unturned to see that it does. I have made it clear in strategic places
                            that a coup would be most unwelcome. I also am taking steps to make sure
                            we are organized to hear about coup plotting in time to do something
                            about it.</p>

                        <p>D. The Viet Cong defection rate is still disappointing, and the level of
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> activity remains high, disruptive
                            and not effectively checked by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>E. But there is encouragement in figures indicating an increase in the
                            amount of information which Vietnamese citizens are giving to the govt
                            concerning the Viet Cong. Surely this is a most significant index. In a
                            very real sense, the citizen is not just expressing a Gallup Poll type
                            preference; he is actually “voting with his life.” If he decides to give
                            information about the Viet Cong and then gets caught, he may very well
                            get killed. This, therefore, represents a vital judgment. I am having
                            the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> look into it.</p>
                        <p>F. I also hear that an order has gone out in some places to the Viet Cong
                            not to congregate in groups of more than 100 men, or at any one place
                            for more than 48 hours. If this becomes a general Viet Cong policy, it
                            would be significant. Much of their strength has been because, in this
                            medievally structured country, they, too, organized themselves in
                            medieval fortresses which were totally impregnable on the ground, where
                            they could stay in safety with plenty of rest for long periods, coming
                            out only to make very well prepared attacks on what the govt had been
                            doing in the countryside. This made the govt's job quite hopeless. Now
                            we are destroying the fortresses.</p>
                        <p>G. Americans in Vietnam report “cautious optimism”—based on belief in the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s ability to carry out its
                            programs, in awareness of Viet Cong reverses, and in passive resistance
                            to Viet Cong “taxes” on recruiting.</p>
                        <p>H. Yet, all of the above is only the beginning of the impact of the
                            American presence—an impact before the First Cavalry and before most of
                            the First Infantry Division were here at all. Moreover, the U.S. troops
                            which are here have by no means done everything they can do to organize
                            the Vietnamese “regional” and “popular” forces for joint
                            American/Vietnamese police type tactics and night patrolling. Thorough
                            pacification has thus yet to be done even within the U.S. base areas.
                            When this happens, the psychological effect should be marked.</p>
                        <p>I. The proposed deployment of the First Infantry Division should allow
                            successful operations against the oldest and most vital Viet Cong
                            redoubt which is not only what has been threatening Saigon for so long,
                            but which is the line of communication from the food source in the Delta
                            to the Viet Cong north of Saigon.</p>
                        <p>J. On another political front, PriMin <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> traveled to Ban Me Thuot and personally presided over
                            the return of 483 Montagnard dissidents who had rallied to the govt. In
                            two speeches, <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> stressed the need
                            for national solidarity, freedom from discrimination, and for the
                            complete merger of the Montagnard and lowland people. He also told me he
                            had evidently taken my advice and had urged his local military
                                commander<pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401" facs="0433"/> to be gradual and
                            tactful in his relationships with the Montagnards. Tension continues and
                            tangible measures must be taken to relieve their inferior status. The
                            U.S. stands ready to help.</p>
                        <p>K. In Quang Nam Province of central Vietnam, govt forces broke up
                            demonstrations protesting against govt air and artillery bombardments,
                            demanding reimbursement for damages caused by military operations and
                            calling for the release of husbands and sons from military service.
                            These demonstrations apparently had nothing to do with the recent Hue
                            struggle movement. They followed the pattern of disturbances which have
                            occurred at widely separated points in the past, often as a result of
                            Viet Cong agitation.</p>
                        <p>2. Military</p>
                        <p>A. Combined forces (U.S., Vietnamese, Australian, and New Zealand) thrust
                            into a Viet Cong base area in Binh Duong Province to upset Viet Cong
                            plans to concentrate strong forces in the area. The 101st Airborne
                            Brigade defeated a major Viet Cong unit north of An Khe in Binh Dinh
                            Province. Meanwhile the Viet Cong mounted only one battalion-size
                            attack, their main activity continuing to be interdiction of
                            communication routes.</p>
                        <p>3. Pacification</p>
                        <p>A. The death of Minister for Rural Construction Nguyen Tat Ung was a
                            serious loss to the rural construction (pacification) effort. He was a
                            forceful Minister and <persName corresp="#p_LEG1">Lansdale</persName>
                            had begun a relationship with him which promised to be fruitful.</p>
                        <p>4. Economic</p>
                        <p>A. Wholesale rice prices began edging up, reflecting low rice stocks in
                            Saigon, poor prospects for further deliveries from the Delta this
                            season, and estimates that the 1966 crop will be 10 to 12 percent below
                            the level of the 1965 crop. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is
                            now relying on <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 imports for
                            immediate needs and for stockpile buildup.</p>
                        <p>5. General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>A. I took the occasion during our most recent joint meeting with the
                            Vietnamese to commend <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>'s
                            approach to the desertion problem. He is stressing the necessity of
                            eliminating corruption among top officers, of improving the troops'
                            understanding of the war, and of carrying out in practice the policy of
                            equal sharing by officers of hardships and dangers. I also congratulated
                            him for his imaginative attitude regarding the refugee problem.</p>

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> has
                            requested a reaffirmation of his authority to use standard riot control
                            munitions in certain specified combat situations in South Vietnam and
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> has supported
                            his request. This authority would extend only to lacrimatory agents
                            (tear gas) known as CS and CN. Use of nausea-producing agents DM and
                            CN-DM would not be authorized.</p>
                        <p>The agents would be used primarily to clear tunnels, caves, and
                            underground shelters in cases where their use will lead to far fewer
                            casualties and less loss of life than would the combat alternatives
                            which involve high explosive or flame munitions. Of particular
                            importance would be the reduction in casualties to civilians who are
                            inevitably mingled with hostile military elements as the result of
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> tactics.</p>
                        <p>I agree with General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>
                            that the use of these riot control agents far outweighs disadvantages
                            that may accrue; in fact there is every indication that we may be in for
                            censure if civilian casualties should accrue because we didn't use tear
                            gas. The disadvantages to which I refer are the likelihood of some sharp
                            international criticism, spurred by Communist propaganda, of the U.S.
                            Government authorizing the employment of what will inevitably be called
                            “poison gas”.</p>
                        <p>Unless you indicate otherwise I will reaffirm to General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> the current national approval
                            for the use of the riot control agents CS and CN under the combat
                            conditions described above.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Rusk concurs in this recommendation.</p>
                        <p>If you approve, the Department of State will send a message to all posts
                            informing them of the decision and providing public affairs

                        <p>To estimate probable Communist reactions to a US program of air attacks
                            on certain new targets in North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Assumptions</p>
                        <p>For the purposes of this estimate we assume air strikes against Phuc Yen
                            and four other airfields near Hanoi and Haiphong; against rail and
                            highway routes and traffic between Hanoi and Haiphong and between
                            Hanoi-Haiphong and China; against four major thermal power plants; and
                            against <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> installations defending
                            these areas. We further assume that attacks on all these targets are
                            begun within the next few weeks and in a roughly simultaneous fashion.
                            We also assume restrikes as necessary and subsequent armed
                            reconnaissance against the rail and highway targets.</p>
                        <p rend="center">The Estimate</p>
                        <p>1. For many months our estimates have emphasized the crucial importance
                            of the fact that the Communists, especially the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and China, believed they were winning the war in South
                            Vietnam and needed only to maintain their momentum until the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> collapsed and the US was forced to
                            abandon the struggle. In this confidence Hanoi has been willing to
                            endure bombings of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, to accept
                            the increasing US commitment, and to refuse any negotiations. Moreover,
                            the Communists have counted on international and domestic pressures on
                            the US, as well as on the growing capabilities of air defense around the
                            critical Hanoi-Haiphong area, to deter further escalation. Finally, they
                            probably have had strong doubts about US determination to face a
                            protracted war, and these feelings have probably been strengthened by
                            repeated US soundings and overtures for negotiations.</p>
                        <pb n="404" xml:id="pg_404" facs="0436"/>
                        <p>2. We think, however, that recently this general confidence has been
                            weakened both by US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military
                            successes and by tangible evidence that the US is willing to increase
                            its commitment. The situation has come to seem more dangerous and
                            discouraging than they probably had expected, and victory must seem to
                            them much further off than it did a few months ago. Thus, we think that
                            the assumed US action would come at a time when <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> doubts may be growing.</p>
                        <p>3. Public Communist declarations and commitments to continue the
                            struggle, however, remain as firm as ever. Recently, the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> has once again vigorously rejected
                            negotiations on any terms except its own, apparently in response to
                            approaches from various intermediaries. The Chinese have been vehement
                            in denouncing negotiations altogether; they have even warned the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> more or less openly against them. Their
                            warnings may indicate Chinese worry that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> is weakening; indeed, there are a few indications,
                            private and tentative, that Hanoi may not be quite as adamant in its
                            position as its public declarations assert.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Immediate Reactions</p>
                        <p>4. The Communists, while they have hoped that the US would continue to
                            exempt the Hanoi-Haiphong area from attack, probably have rated as
                            fairly high the chances of the kind of US attacks assumed here. Their
                            reactions, therefore, would probably not be greatly affected by shock or
                            surprise.</p>
                        <p>5. The North Vietnamese would, of course, defend as best they could
                            against the attacks. Beyond this, they might retaliate quickly. It is
                            possible that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> has contingency
                            plans for surviving aircraft to attack American bases in the South or US
                            carriers. There is no evidence of training for this type of mission.
                            They would probably expect such strikes to provoke wider and heavier US
                            attacks. Thus, we think that the chances would be against such
                            retaliation, though it cannot be ruled out.</p>
                        <p>6. A second immediate danger would be Chinese air intervention—either
                            over the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> or against South Vietnam or
                            US carriers. It is possible that Hanoi and Peking already have an agreed
                            plan for the Chinese to intervene from their own bases in response to
                            the kind of US attack assumed in this estimate. We doubt this; the
                            Chinese are not likely to have made a firm or unqualified commitment.
                            They would wish to weigh the effectiveness of the initial US attack and
                            to receive the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> reaction before
                            making any move likely to invite a US attack on South China. However,
                            the danger of accidental encounters would be particularly high if US
                            aircraft were operating close to the border.</p>
                        <p>7. Thus in the first few days, during and immediately following the onset
                            of the US attacks, there would be a chance of an attack on US bases or
                            ships and a chance of Chinese air intervention. But we think these
                            unlikely.</p>
                        <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0437"/>
                        <p>8. Of course, there would also be a great hue and cry from the Communist
                            side, and the usual stream of protests, threats and warnings. We would
                            also expect new acts of terrorism and sabotage inside South Vietnam,
                            particularly against US forces. Viet Cong capabilities in these fields
                            are considerably greater than they have yet chosen to demonstrate. The
                            principal Communist reactions however, would come in later weeks and
                            months, and they would of necessity be greatly affected by the ongoing
                            course of military and political events as well as by the US actions we
                            consider in this estimate.</p>

                        <p>9. <hi rend="italic">China</hi>. The Chinese would strongly urge the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to continue the fight; to this
                            end they would probably promise more equipment and personnel to build up
                            air defenses, and particularly to defend and repair the interdicted
                            lines of communication to South China. The Chinese might agree to send
                            their own aircraft and pilots to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, but on balance we think this unlikely in the wake of the
                            demonstrated vulnerability of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                                airfields.<note n="3" xml:id="d148fn3">The Director, NSA, National

                            negotiating, and they might warn the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            not to count on Chinese support if it moved toward a cease-fire or a
                            diplomatic settlement. We think Chinese views carry great weight in
                            Hanoi, particularly if the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> leaders
                            were divided over future policy.</p>
                        <p>10. It may be that these US attacks would tip the balance and cause
                            Chinese intervention. The Chinese might believe that the war had passed
                            the point of no return and that a US-Chinese confrontation was the
                            inevitable price of continuing the war in South Vietnam. The Chinese
                            have made this war the test case for their doctrine of “peoples war”
                            against the US; they have staked much prestige on it. We cannot be very
                            confident that the Chinese would continue to refrain from intervening in
                            the air from their own bases as the US continued attacks near the
                            Chinese border and against a weakened <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. But on balance we think it unlikely that they would so
                                intervene.<note n="4" xml:id="d148fn4">The Director, NSA, National

                                the source text.]</note> With somewhat more confidence, we estimate
                            that the US attacks would not provoke large-scale Chinese intervention
                            with ground combat forces; Peking would almost certainly believe that
                            this would run very high risks of war with the US.</p>
                        <p>11. <hi rend="italic">The USSR</hi>. The Soviets would increase their
                            efforts to halt the conflict. They would put pressure on the US and urge
                            negotiations on Hanoi. There are some recent indications that the
                            Soviets are now more<pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0438"/> willing to
                            put some pressure on the DRV, perhaps because they believe their
                            military assistance and the trend of the guerrilla war gives their view
                            greater authority. The Soviets would almost certainly agree to DRV
                            requests to replace air defense equipment, although they would do so
                            more to retain their influence with the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> than in the expectation that they could furnish an
                            adequate defense against US operations.</p>
                        <p>12. The Soviets could try to relieve pressures on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> by moving against the US in Berlin. We
                            continue to believe there are strong inhibitions against a double
                            crisis. Carefully controlled harassments and occasionally provocative
                            demonstrations of US vulnerabilities are always possible, however. A
                            potentially unstable situation in the Soviet leadership adds an element
                            of uncertainty to the Soviet positions.</p>
                        <p>13. <hi rend="italic">The DRV</hi>. In Hanoi, reactions would probably
                            develop along one of two conflicting lines:</p>
                        <p>(a) Hanoi might believe that the new US attacks and the subsequent
                            interdiction campaign did not alter the basic situation. The North
                            Vietnamese might stick to their belief that the guerrilla war is, by
                            definition, a prolonged struggle against heavy odds, that there will be
                            setbacks and defeats, but that the ultimate gain is worth it. They might
                            feel that damping down the war in the wake of US attacks would appear a
                            capitulation. They might feel that if the war were interrupted the Viet
                            Cong movement could not long maintain its morale and cohesion. Along
                            this line of reasoning they might also conclude that the US escalation
                            of bombings would still not do intolerable damage and would probably not
                            be extended to attacks on urban population. They might decide that the
                            US was desperate in the face of a long war involving US troops in the
                            South, and that further struggle, perhaps involving the dispatch of
                                <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> units to the South on an
                            increased scale, was the best course to crack the Saigon Government and
                            US resolve.</p>
                        <p>(b) On the other hand, the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> might
                            estimate the situation quite differently. The growing US commitment in
                            the South might persuade them that the guerrilla war could not be
                            prosecuted to final victory. Without such a promise of ultimate success
                            they might believe Viet Cong morale could not be sustained. Moreover,
                            the attacks on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>'s air defenses
                            and on a wider range of targets might convince them that the US intended
                            to escalate the air war almost indefinitely, if necessary. Thus they
                            might decide that, while their position in the South was still strong
                            and the Viet Cong still intact, it would be more expedient to move
                            toward negotiations or some tacit understanding in order to pursue their
                            objectives through political means, and possibly at some future time to
                            resume guerrilla warfare.</p>
                        <p>14. We believe that the US course of action assumed here would reinforce
                            the thinking described in subparagraph (b) above. Even so, it is not
                            likely that the North Vietnamese would move immediately to the
                            conference <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0439"/>table; they would
                            probably feel that there was still time to test the effectiveness of the
                            Viet Cong against US forces. They might still hope to strike a critical
                            blow against US and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> morale, perhaps
                            by engaging US forces somewhere in the hinterland. Failing this, they
                            might next revert to hit and run tactics for a time. And there is still
                            the question of whether China could prevent a switch to political
                            tactics.</p>
                        <p>15. In general, however, we think it unlikely that in the new situation
                            created by the US attacks assumed here, the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would simply continue the war along present lines. We
                            think that this US course of action would be more likely in time to move
                            the North Vietnamese toward political and diplomatic initiatives than to
                            cause them to escalate the war.</p>
                        <p>16. <hi rend="italic">The Viet Cong</hi>. As noted above, Viet Cong
                            morale is an important ingredient in <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            estimates of how to prosecute the war. We have little good evidence on
                            the state of Viet Cong morale. And it is difficult to judge the impact
                            of specific US moves, since their effectiveness is a gradual cumulative
                            process. In the assumed instance, the new US air attacks on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would be unlikely to affect Viet Cong
                            capabilities or intentions in the short run. Over the longer term,
                            however, if it became apparent that supply and reinforcement were more
                            and more difficult, it is likely that <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            morale would deteriorate, particularly if they suffered setbacks on the
                            order of Chu Lai together with continuing pressure on the ground and
                            from the air.</p>
                        <p>17. <hi rend="italic">Other Considerations.</hi> A current factor which
                            might play some role is the Indo-Pakistani conflict. The Communists
                            might see the new US move in Vietnam as an attempt to take advantage of
                            the diversion of world attention to the Indian subcontinent. The US
                            attack might help to dissuade the Chinese from any major involvement
                            there. Peking would almost certainly be increasingly reluctant to divert
                            resources to support Pakistan in the face of new escalation in Vietnam,
                            its primary area of concern. In general, however, we think that the
                            course of the Indo-Pakistani conflict would not greatly affect Communist
                            reactions to the US course of action considered in this estimate.</p>
                        <p>The following is the position of the Director of Intelligence and
                            Research, Department of State:</p>

                            State, dissents fundamentally from the key estimates made above. He
                            believes that the postulated air strikes against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>'s <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>
                            sites, airfields, thermal plants, and prime rail, road, and traffic
                            targets would be seen by the Communists—as well as by most other
                            observers—as marking a fundamental change in the character of our
                            escalation of the Vietnam war. Separated strikes on these targets,
                            carefully spaced over time, would help reduce adverse reactions,
                            although these would be serious in any event. The composite program
                            assumed here, however, would be regarded as a political and military <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0440"/>watershed comparable to that of
                            last February when our bombing of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> began.</p>
                        <p>2. Hanoi, Peking, and Moscow would all view the strikes as initiating—and
                            in large part executing—the highest level of militarily significant
                            escalation available in the DRV short of ground invasion. Even assuming
                            precision bombing, the strikes would inextricably involve industrial and
                            civilian losses beyond the objectives deliberately targeted, as well as
                            almost certain Soviet and Chinese casualties. In operation the new
                            program would appear to have exempted only deliberate attacks (of no
                            military significance) on the population itself. Communists and
                            non-Communists alike would consider that this sudden massive action
                            contradicted the many prior official indications, public and private,
                            that we intended to respect the special sensitivity of the
                            Hanoi-Haiphong complex. They would regard these undifferentiated and
                            simultaneous strikes as a gross departure from our past policy of
                            graduated pressure. They would probably conclude that we had decided to
                            forsake further efforts to project a judicious combination of
                            political-military pressures against the infiltration network, and had
                            chosen instead the blunt instrument of a broad military assault on the
                            chief elements of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> economy and
                            its self-defense capability. The credibility of our protestations of
                            limited objectives would slump, and our actions would just as plausibly
                            be seen to invite the capitulation of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> under pain of total destruction, raise the specter of
                            an eventual invasion on the ground, and in any case appear to threaten
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>'s ability to survive.</p>
                        <p>3. Under these circumstances, it is unlikely that Hanoi would choose to
                            move toward negotiations or compromise; it is unlikely that Moscow could
                            afford or would be willing to urge Hanoi to do so; and it is certain
                            that Peking would press Hanoi to persevere. These positions would be
                            mutually reinforcing.</p>
                        <p>4. The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> leaders, as the estimate
                            notes, have recently indicated that their terms for negotiation may not
                            be as inflexible as they have sometimes seemed. The assumed attacks,
                            however, would immediately deter Hanoi from any diplomatic overtures it
                            may possibly have been contemplating. It would fear that any sign of
                            compromise under such pressure would be read by friends and enemies as
                            capitulation, would undermine all possible future bargaining positions,
                            would irreparably damage Viet Cong morale, and would predispose the US
                            to renew these pressures at any time and under any conditions it thought
                            appropriate. Whatever hesitancies the DRV may have had would now be
                            resolved in favor of militant prosecution of the war and of more
                            insistent requests for, and far fewer qualms over, Chinese and Soviet
                            aid.</p>
                        <p>5. Far from seeking a respite from the bombings, the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would attempt to retaliate by raising
                            the tempo of the ground war. It would send additional ground forces to
                            Laos and South Vietnam as rapidly as the <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0441"/>infiltration routes permit. It probably would surface
                            these efforts, at least to the extent of acknowledging the despatch of
                            “regrouped southerners” and “volunteers,” both to raise Viet Cong morale
                            and to discourage the US and its supporters with the prospect of a long
                            jungle war.</p>
                        <p>6. The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would certainly at once press
                            Peking and Moscow vigorously for prompt aid in rebuilding its defenses
                            against air attacks. Inhibitions about additional Soviet and Chinese
                            presence in the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would diminish.
                            Hanoi might well drop whatever reservations it may have had against the
                            use of Soviet or Chinese pilots. It would be most impatient with
                            Sino-Soviet disputes about transit rights, but would expect those past
                            hurdles to be overcome in the new atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>7. Although Hanoi's reaction will continue to be of primary importance,
                            the locus of decision making will shift perceptibly away from Hanoi to
                            Peking and Moscow. Peking will have a major role in determining the
                            overall Communist response to the assumed US actions. Given the
                            preceding estimate of Hanoi's response, these reactions will be
                            consistent. Hence the frustrating dilemma of the main estimate probably
                            will not arise—Hanoi's switching to a negotiatory track despite giving
                            China's contrary views “great weight.” (Compare paragraphs 9 and 15 of
                            the <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss>.)</p>
                        <p>8. It is almost certain that Hanoi and Peking have concerted their
                            preparations and discussed plans for Chinese action in the event of US
                            attacks such as the ones assumed here. The Chinese would strongly urge
                            Hanoi to reject any thought of negotiations, and they will purposefully
                            underwrite the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>'s will to persist.
                            They would furnish the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> with logistic
                            assistance in prosecuting the war in the south and in making further US
                            air attacks as costly as possible. They would give safe haven to any
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> planes which escaped our strikes
                            and would permit them to operate from Chinese bases. They would probably
                            provide Chinese planes and pilots to operate from the remaining <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> facilities if and when useable.</p>
                        <p>9. The Chinese would immediately increase their defensive air patrols
                            along their frontier and perhaps over adjacent <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> territory in which their ground forces appear to be
                            active. The danger of accidental encounters with US planes will be high
                            and will increase as US planes approach the border. If the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> airfields are successfully interdicted,
                            there is a better than even chance that Chinese air will intervene from
                            Chinese bases.</p>
                        <p>10. The Chinese would probably in any case increase their presence on the
                            ground in North Vietnam, furnishing anti-aircraft, engineer, and supply
                            units and, if asked, providing combat forces to defend against a
                            possible US invasion of the north, thus freeing <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> forces to go southward. With the destruction of the
                            rail line into China, the logistical problem of supplying the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would increase. To the degree that the
                            US <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0442"/>program is successful and
                            South China must become the operational and infrastructure base for
                            further air defense of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, the
                            Chinese will need Soviet support and protection. Greater Soviet
                            involvement might reluctantly be desired to deter the US. This is an
                            additional factor likely to promote a constructive resolution of
                            previous Sino-Soviet frictions over the speed, scope, and method of
                            aiding Hanoi and bolstering South China bases.</p>
                        <p>11. We do not believe that the Pakistan-India war is likely to place any
                            limitation on Peking's willingness and ability to carry out the
                            foregoing responses. Peking has prepared its forces and its population
                            for some time to face the eventuality of the US actions assumed in this
                            estimate. Its likely actions against India, outlined in <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 13-10-65, will probably not be
                            deterred by such US actions, nor will the Indian theater require the
                            diversion of Chinese air or ground forces available to support North
                            Vietnam and to defend South China.</p>
                        <p>12. Indeed in addition to the general increase in pressures generated by
                            the interacting nature of the two Asian theaters of war, Peking would be
                            aware of certain comparative advantages in an escalatory response to the
                            American move in North Vietnam. Peking knows that the Vietnam theater
                            tends to bring the US into confrontation with both China and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, while the Indian theater tends to
                            bring the US into confrontation only with China. Therefore Peking would
                            hope to breach US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations on the
                            matter of Vietnam, reducing thereby the freedom of both the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the US to respond against Chinese
                            pressures in the Subcontinent.</p>
                        <p>13. The Soviets would be specifically affronted by the assumed US course
                            of action in Vietnam. They would almost certainly interpret it as an
                            assault on the viability of North Vietnam, whose security they have
                            committed themselves to defend. They would be likely to regard the US
                            action as a direct challenge to themselves, the more so since it would
                            probably result in Soviet casualties. They would be unlikely to place
                            any credence in assurances that US intentions were still limited
                            (something they have been prepared to do thus far). The sensational
                            nature of the American initiative and the obstinacy of the Chinese and
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> reaction to it would harden the
                            Soviet response.</p>
                        <p>14. Under these circumstances Moscow would be less likely than ever to
                            press Hanoi to negotiate, and it would redouble its effort to
                            participate meaningfully in the defense of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. Moscow would renew its earlier offers of additional
                            aircraft and pilots and would attempt to increase the flow of <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s and technicians to man them. The
                            Soviets would renew their proposals of last spring for a cooperative
                            effort with the Chinese to aid Hanoi. The Chinese, for their part, would
                            find it more difficult than previously to refuse reasonable cooperation
                            in expediting Soviet aid, especially in view of the assumed destruction
                            of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>-Chinese <pb n="411" xml:id="pg_411" facs="0443"/>rail lines. Despite the continuing
                            hostility between Chinese and Soviets, their respective stakes in the
                            struggle are likely to lead to competition to see who can help Hanoi
                            most effectively.</p>
                        <p>15. Unfortunately for them, Soviet problems in providing rapid and
                            effective aid would be serious. <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            airfields and associated installations would be unusable, heavily
                            damaged, or under continuing attack. Previously prepared <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> sites would likewise be difficult to
                            replenish, and the US would presumably not abstain from attacking sites
                            in preparation, as it did during the installation of the present
                            Soviet-supplied <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> capability. Under
                            these conditions, it is likely that the Soviets would make a strong
                            attempt to mount an air defense effort from Chinese territory and we
                            believe that, despite haggling, some arrangement to this end would be
                            consummated. As a bargaining factor with Moscow, Peking will probably
                            request—and Moscow provide—sophisticated Soviet air defense equipment
                                (<gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss> 21s and <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s) to protect bases and logistical lines in South
                            China.</p>
                        <p>16. We believe that fundamentally the Soviets would nevertheless remain
                            interested in an end to the conflict. While under the stepped up
                            military assistance effort which we believe they would be bound to make
                            the Soviets would be prepared to run the risk of direct engagements with
                            US forces in Vietnam, we believe that they would not contemplate these
                            risks with any equanimity and would still attempt to prevent escalation
                            from running out of control. Accordingly, even in addition to its
                            greater military involvement, Moscow can be expected to resort to
                            various forms of political pressures to deter the US, including a
                            further substantial worsening in bilateral relations.</p>

                        <p>You will recall that at your July 28 press conference<note n="4" xml:id="d149fn4">See <ref target="#d97">Document 97</ref>.</note>
                            you stated that you had ordered deployments which would raise our
                            fighting strength from 75,000 to 125,000 men almost immediately, that
                            additional forces would be needed later, and that they would be sent as
                            requested.</p>
                        <p>Prior to that date—specifically, on July 24—the Joint Staff, as a result
                            of <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> requests, had revised their
                            total for 1965 deployment, increasing it to a little more than 195,000.
                            I mentioned this higher figure to you at the time. At the August 2-6
                            Honolulu Meeting of General Wheeler, Admiral Sharp and General
                            Westmoreland, the 1965 “Phase I” requirements were refined to 210,000.
                            The Joint Chiefs of Staff on August 23 therefore made specific
                            deployment recommendations totaling approximately 210,000.<note n="5" xml:id="d149fn5">See <ref target="#d132fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                    132</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Refinements continue to be made. For example, General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> on September 4 listed an
                            additional 3,000 for the 1965 Phase I (mainly three engineer
                            construction/combat battalions); at the same time he indicated that
                            approximately an equivalent number listed earlier (mainly helicopter
                            personnel) will be arriving after the end of 1965. My prediction is that
                            the final version of the 1965 Phase I requirement will end up exceeding
                            210,000 by a few thousand.</p>
                        <p>The differences between the 175,000 figure first mentioned in July and
                            the 210,000 number now being discussed are primarily attributable to
                            additional (a) air lift to move supplies around the country for both
                            civilian and military purposes, (b) air defense, (c) artillery to
                            support offensive operations and to provide immediate response to calls
                            for help by villages under attack, (d) strike aircraft and associated
                            support, (e) engineers, primarily to construct additional air bases, and
                            (f) fleshing out, according to General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>'s requests, of existing operational units
                            and advisory and support elements (refugee relief teams, intelligence
                            teams, communications, and security units, etc.).</p>
                        <p>You have authorized the deployment of 175,000 US personnel. I recommend
                            that, at the present time, you authorize the movement of an additional
                            35,000 men, bringing the total to 210,000. These deployments are
                            essential to our effort. The authority will cover our requirements as
                            they now appear although, as we have discussed before, forces in
                            addition to the 210,000 may be needed later.</p>

                        <p>Tear Gas in Vietnam</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> has
                            requested a reaffirmation of authority to use certain riot control
                            agents in Vietnam, and Secretaries Rusk and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> join in recommending that he be given clear
                            authorization to use tear gas (CS and CN), but not the more violent
                            nausea-producing gases (DM and CN-DM), either alone or in combination.
                            As you know, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>
                            has had reservations about this recommendation, and in deference to his
                            wishes, the recommendation has been held up until after his initial
                            speech. But now Westmoreland wants to use the tear gas in an operation
                            on Saturday, and we all think it is time to go ahead.</p>
                        <p>If this recommendation is approved, our plan would be to have no
                            announcement in Washington, but to have Westmoreland make it clear in
                            due course after the Saturday operation that tear gas (and tear gas
                            only) is authorized in cases where it is more humane, and especially
                            with respect to civilians.</p>
                        <p>There will be some international criticism, but even the New York Times
                            is resoundingly with us on this. I do not worry you with the pros and
                            cons because it seems to me that the common sense of the matter is so
                            clear.</p>

                        <p>A recent review of the situation in Vietnam by key officials of State and
                            Defense and myself indicated that the emerging situation there required
                            some hard thinking on future U.S. military and political actions. We
                            posed several questions to <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>
                            for comment.<note n="2" xml:id="d151fn2">See <ref target="#d141">Documents 141</ref> and <ref target="#d144">144</ref>.</note>

                            <hi rend="italic">U.S. Ground Operations</hi>. In the light of our
                            military build-up we felt that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> may
                            be avoiding major unit actions and reverting to a strategy of
                            small-scale actions over a prolonged period. The problem arises as to
                            how we use our substantial ground and air strength effectively against
                            small-scale harassment-type action, whether we should engage in
                            pacification as opposed to patrolling actively, and whether, indeed, we
                            should taper off our ground force build-up.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> agreed that <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> may seek to avoid large-scale operations
                            but felt that the Vietnamese must deal with small-scale actions through
                            an effective military-political campaign. U.S. forces should undertake
                            “thorough pacification” within their own areas. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> endorses <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>'s current strategic
                            concept which calls for the deployment of all troops now scheduled for
                            Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>'s
                            concept:</p>
                        <p>1. Halt the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> offensive.</p>
                        <p>2. Destroy <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> units where they can be
                            found and pacify selected high priority areas.</p>
                        <p>3. Restore progressively the entire country to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> control.</p>
                        <p>4. Support “rural reconstruction” with comprehensive attention to the
                            pacification process.</p>
                        <p>5. Continue the air campaign against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and infiltration routes into Laos.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> feel <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> “lie-low” tactics will become
                            increasingly a police-social action problem. They expect increased
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> terrorism, subversion and economic
                            warfare. Thus far, there is no evidence of significant <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> resentment of U.S. ground actions.</p>

                            overall analysis and evaluation of our air operations. We suggested the
                            possibility of sending a military-civilian survey team (similar to those

                            the problem of using our increased air capability more effectively and

                            <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> reports that the Mission
                            has started to grapple with this whole problem. The Hop Tac operation
                            (pacification of provinces bordering Saigon) is getting priority
                            attention and <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> is
                            encouraging <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> to concentrate
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> efforts on pacification.
                            Westmoreland is working up a joint U.S.-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> campaign plan and will be prepared to brief Washington
                            on this by the end of this month. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> believes this will be responsive to our desire for
                            a definition of the respective roles for U.S. and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces.</p>

                        <p>Hanoi has now responded to U.S. policy statements on settling the war
                            with an official government memorandum detailing their own current
                            “views”. This statement, in the form of a Foreign Ministry paper, is the
                            most extensive pronouncement on Hanoi policy since the four point
                            proposal of 8 April.<note n="3" xml:id="d152fn3">See vol. II, <ref target="#d25">Document 25</ref>.</note> Hanoi probably regards
                            the document as its side of a dialogue with Washington on terms for
                            negotiation. The memorandum also serves as a response to the many recent
                            proposals by free world leaders on ending the war. Its timing may have
                            been set by a Hanoi desire to go on record prior to the opening of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly. (Incidentally,
                            the paper flatly rejects the use of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in settling the war.)</p>
                        <p>The memorandum offers no new proposals for settling the conflict, and no
                            explicit concessions. It does, however, by dint of its phraseology on
                            several points and by its omission of several hard-line concepts
                            contained in prior statements, convey an impression of greater
                            flexibility than has been present overall in any past policy
                            pronouncements. It is apparently not a signal that Hanoi is now ready to
                            step to the negotiating table, but rather that the North Vietnamese have
                            reviewed their bidding, made some adjustments, and are waiting to hear
                            the response of the other principals, most notably the United States.
                            The statement follows other indications, both public and private, that
                            Hanoi is now more interested in hearing what U.S. officials and friends
                            of the U.S. have to say about negotiations, and that Hanoi is also
                            trying to be more explicit in outlining its own position.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Bundy:</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CJA1">Califano</persName> told me the following

                        </p>
                        <p>1. The President asked him to discuss with <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> memo<note n="3" xml:id="d153fn3">
                                <ref target="#d147">Document 147</ref>.</note> on increasing the
                            number of US forces in South Vietnam. The President wanted to know
                            whether a decision had to be made immediately.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_CJA1">Califano</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> told him a decision did not

                        <p>3. Upon reporting this information to the President, the President asked
                            that a meeting be set up Tuesday to include <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, Secretary Rusk, you and <persName corresp="#p_CJA1">Califano</persName> to discuss any increase in the
                            current level of forces. The President appeared reluctant to contemplate
                            going above 200,000 and asked Califano to ask <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to be prepared with an
                            alternative ceiling.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> will be ready with an
                            alternative proposal on Tuesday, including a phased movement of forces
                            spread over a longer period of time so that a decision could be taken at
                            any time to stop further increases.</p>
                        <p>Marvin Watson has scheduled a luncheon for Tuesday at 1 p.m. at which
                            time this subject can be discussed.<note n="4" xml:id="d153fn4">A note

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked if we had really
                            made clear to the North Viet-Namese what our position was for a
                            settlement. I said that we had been in touch with the North Viet-Namese
                            through various channels but so far had found no disposition on their
                            part to have any serious discussion. He urged that we make clear to them
                            our exact position on their four points. I said I thought we had done
                            this in our many public statements as well as some indirect private
                            ones.</p>
                        <p>Upon being pressed by him, I said the one point that gave us the most
                            trouble was that concerning the role of the National Liberation Front.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that including
                            dependents, about eight hundred thousand people supported the Viet Cong
                            and our position left them no way out. I disagreed with this and said
                            that if peace were established, they could participate in elections and
                            obtain representation. I said that in dealing with this matter, however,
                            we had to take account of the attitude and position of the South
                            Viet-Namese Government. I said it seemed clear that the Chinese
                            Communists were pressing Hanoi not to negotiate. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked if I did not think there
                            was some difference in the positions of Peking and Hanoi. I said I was
                            not an expert in this field but it seemed to me that there was always a
                            slight difference in the public statements of Peking and Hanoi and that
                            Hanoi always seemed to want to keep the door open just a bit, whereas
                            Peking's position was absolutely rigid.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> reviewed his memorandum

                                <ref target="#d147">Document 147</ref>.</note> concerning the need
                            to increase the level of forces in Vietnam. He said that the original
                            estimate of 175,000 was now increased to 210,000. The proposed 35,000
                            increase did not involve any increase in combat troops; they were
                            support troops, such as communications personnel and refugee relief
                            units. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> requested an
                            interim authorization to go to 195,000 men and indicated that he would
                            be back to the President about November 15 with a request for the
                            remaining 15,000 men. The President commented that it was a situation in
                            which he had no choice but to approve the increase. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> confirmed the President's
                            comment and the President approved the increase to 195,000 men.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that the public
                            announcement of increased troops would be made from Saigon as the troops
                            arrived there. While he admitted that this would encourage rumors, he
                            said that this was important for the security of our men and in line
                            with previously announced policies.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Bundy noted that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had authorized a one-time use of tear gas by
                            General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d155fn4">See <ref target="#d150">Document 150</ref>.</note>
                            He said that the question of the continuing use of tear gas was still up
                            in the air, although the authority to use tear gas technically remained
                            with the field commander, General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said it would be desirable for Westmoreland to use
                            tear gas before the end of the week because of the Red Cross conference
                            next week in Geneva, which might make some statements opposing the use
                            of tear gas. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that
                            the use of tear gas must be handled carefully in the right operation and
                            that he was opposed to pushing <pb n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0452"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> to use it within
                            the next few days unless <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> felt such action was desirable. Bundy said
                            that the President might get a press query about tear gas if he held a
                            press conference tomorrow. McNamara suggested that the President respond
                            by stating (1) tear gas is a humane way to restore order under certain
                            circumstances and (2) <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> is authorized to use it in those
                            circumstances. Bundy underscored the importance of using the words “tear
                            gas” rather than “non-lethal agents” or “riot control agents”. <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Moyers</persName> said that we had been too
                            defensive in our public handling of the tear gas situation, that we
                            should remind the world that the Viet Cong slit throats and bomb
                            children and that any human being in one of the Vietnam caves would
                            prefer to cry from tear gas rather than be killed by hand grenades.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName> agreed.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Rice Shipments</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Bundy said <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> had requested
                            100,000 tons of rice as fast as possible. Bundy proposed to make the
                            rice available in four shipments of 25,000 tons each, rather than in a
                            single shipment. The President approved this. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that no matter how we
                            were shipping the rice, we were not sending enough rice to South Vietnam
                            and that we should be sending three or four hundred thousand tons of
                            rice. The President agreed and Bundy said he would make sure there was a
                            continuing program for the purchase and shipment of rice to South
                            Vietnam.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Bundy said he was inclined to the view that the President should make a
                            statement at his press conference about the non-military elements of our
                            Vietnam effort. Bundy said that only when the President makes such
                            statements did they get any substantial coverage. He believed it was
                            important to obtain such coverage in view of the world opinion and
                            forthcoming student demonstrations. Bundy said he would submit a
                            statement to the President for his consideration this afternoon.<note n="5" xml:id="d155fn5">At 7:30 p.m. on September 29, McGeorge Bundy
                                sent the President a statement that he entitled, “The Works of Peace
                                in Vietnam.” Bundy stated that he had learned from <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill Moyers</persName> that a press conference
                                was unlikely, but Bundy thought the President might be interested in
                                reading the statement and might consider releasing it in conjunction
                                with publicity for Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RH1">Howard

                            we were not rough enough in our bombing.<note n="8" xml:id="d155fn8">Apparently a reference to <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss>

                            may well be that some aspects of the bombing program were responsible
                            for Hanoi's hardening attitude. The President approved the Rolling

                        <p>1100. For the President. Politico-Military.</p>
                        <p>1. Progress along strictly military lines appears to be considerably
                            ahead of progress along civil and political lines. Yet civil-political
                            progress is utterly indispensable to a successful outcome.</p>
                        <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0454"/>
                        <p>2. For one thing, the majority of Viet Cong are probably still in small
                            groups rather than in main force units and will thus not be reached by
                            the planned military offensives. These small <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> groups cannot be overcome without the support of the
                            population, organized on a precinct basis. If these <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are not overcome, the worst of the
                            aggression will still be going on, requiring continuing presence of
                            American ground troops.</p>
                        <p>3. It seems clear that U.S. military can prevent the Viet Cong from
                            taking over the state, can destroy or neutralize main force units, and
                            can destroy hitherto impregnable redoubts. These are very big
                            achievements indeed. But they do not prevent the Viet Cong from
                            continuing to have a disruptive and debilitating effect on the country
                            which would mean that as soon as we left, the Viet Cong would take over
                            again. In other words, a durable result would not have been
                            accomplished.</p>
                        <p>4. In order to hasten the day when a true precinct organization exists
                            which will destroy the Viet Cong in small groupings, I called a meeting
                            on Monday and presented a working paper for illustrative purposes which
                            was discussed in detail paragraph by paragraph. As a result, there is in
                            the U.S. Mission an organized effort under the chairmanship of
                            Ambassador Porter to help the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> create
                            their own precinct type structure which will enable it to overcome the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in small groups.</p>
                        <p>5. The text of the working paper is as follows:</p>
                        <p>“In each city precinct and each rural hamlet immediately adjacent to a
                            thoroughly pacified city (i.e. the smallest unit from a public safety
                            standpoint) the following program should be undertaken in the following
                            order:</p>
                        <p>A. Saturate the minds of the people with some socially conscious and
                            attractive ideology, which is susceptible of being carried out.</p>
                        <p>B. Organize the people politically with a hamlet chief and committee
                            whose actions would be backed by the police or the military using
                            police-type tactics. This committee should have representatives of the
                            political, military, economic and social organizations and should have
                            an executive who directs.</p>
                        <p>C. With the help of the police or military, conduct a census.</p>
                        <p>D. Issue identification cards.</p>
                        <p>E. Issue permits for the movement of goods and people.</p>
                        <p>F. When necessary, hold a curfew.</p>
                        <p>G. Thanks to all those methods, go through each hamlet with a fine tooth
                            comb to apprehend the terrorists.</p>
                        <p>H. At the first quiet moment, bring in agricultural experts, school
                            teachers, etc.</p>
                        <p>I. The hamlet should also be organized for its own defense against small
                            Viet Cong external attacks.</p>
                        <p>J. When the above has been done, hold local elections.</p>

                        <p>6. I believe that all Americans here are pulling together on this—which
                            is the indispensable first step towards getting the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to move. <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423" facs="0455"/>We now await appointment of a Minister of Rural
                            Construction (Pacification) by Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>—at which time we are prepared to move in.</p>
                        <p>7. After the Viet Cong has been overcome by force, both in its large and
                            small grouping, there must be a certain degree of indigenous political
                            development. Otherwise, our defeat of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> by force could be followed by a Communist takeover by
                            political means. It could then well be said: the operation was a great
                            success, but the patient died. <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Tran Van
                                Do</persName>, the sagacious Vietnamese Foreign Minister, says:</p>
                        <p>“If peace were suddenly to return to the land and if elections were to
                            take place soon afterwards, the results would be catastrophic. What
                            would happen if there were to be a cease-fire? The Communists would
                            simply step in to fill a political vacuum.”</p>
                        <p>8. The United States must thus leave no stone unturned politically,
                            working through both the official and the unofficial (but highly
                            influential) Vietnamese to insure that our victory over the Viet Cong by
                            force is not followed by a Communist takeover by politics. End of

                        <p>10. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> went to Hue
                            on September 23 and shared the platform with General <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName>, I Corps Commander, who castigated
                            those who caused trouble on the home front while troops were dying in
                            the field. This represents a change in <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName>'s public attitude.</p>
                        <p>11. We hear that <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> is planning to
                            make a number of changes in key military posts and in the Cabinet in the
                            interests of increased efficiency. The military changes may in fact
                            reflect a response to sentiments expressed by junior officers during the
                            recent armed forces convention in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>12. While waiting for the Korean Prime Minister's arrival at the airport
                                <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> talked at length and quite
                            freely with the press. He probably did some injudicious ad libbing, but
                            the overall impression he gave was one of complete self-assurance.</p>
                        <p>13. The Viet Cong became considerably more active militarily during the
                            week particularly in central Vietnam, but so far have taken heavy <pb n="424" xml:id="pg_424" facs="0456"/>losses. They seem to be making
                            a major effort along Highway No. 1 north of Qui Nhon.</p>
                        <p>Economic</p>
                        <p>14. The Prime Minister and Chief of State put out a decree increasing
                            custom duties on a wide range of goods which should increase annual
                            customs revenues on the order of some 1.8 billion piasters.</p>
                        <p>15. I have appointed a small economic warfare working group to recommend
                            policy measures to deny needed resources to the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and to monitor the execution of such denial programs.
                            This has great potential importance.</p>
                        <p>16. The rice situation in central Vietnam is improving with the arrival
                            of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 and Thai rice. Last week I
                            signed a <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 Title I agreement with
                            the Prime Minister providing for shipment of an additional 100,000
                            metric tons of rice to meet November and December needs. This too is
                            vital.</p>
                        <p>Psychological</p>
                        <p>17. Field reports and Vietnamese newspaper coverage reflected
                            considerable optimism, perhaps almost over-optimism, among Vietnamese
                            regarding the progress of the war.</p>
                        <p>Added note:</p>
                        <p>18. Since writing the above, I have just learned that Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> sent for <persName corresp="#p_LEG1">Lansdale</persName> Wednesday morning in <persName corresp="#p_LEG1">Lansdale</persName>'s capacity as Chairman of the

                            <persName corresp="#p_LEG1">Lansdale</persName> arrived with members of
                            his committee. <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> kept them for
                            five hours, provided lunch and went over his ideas for pacification
                            which appear to be in harmony with ours. Encouraging is his awareness of
                            the psychological factor. He discussed places to receive priority for
                            pacification. He wants our views. He announced his intention of
                            appointing Le Van Tien as Minister of Pacification—an appointment he
                            said he had thought about a great deal, and a man whom he considers very
                            able. Tien has reputation as a brilliant braintruster and idea man. A
                            Catholic, he is said to “retain Buddhist tenets”.</p>
                        <p>19. <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> said that he will run
                            pacification himself—which he should do, as its importance to Vietnam
                            and to the U.S. is absolutely central.</p>
                        <p>20. I called a special meeting of the U.S. Mission Council so that we can
                            all take fullest advantage of this unusual and promising
                            opportunity.</p>
                        <p>21. I am advising <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> that he must
                            not have his pacification plan known as the “<persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> plan” because this will automatically put a lot of
                            people to work to sabotage it. He must manage to get credit for many
                            others and to involve all the leading men in Vietnam personally in the
                            plan's success.</p>

                            encouraging new step forward.</p>
                        <p>2. Yesterday Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>
                            asked <persName corresp="#p_LEG1">Lansdale</persName> in his capacity as
                            chairman of the US-Liaison Committee to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> Agency for Pacification to bring his committee members
                            from <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and JUSPAO and join him and some of his staff in a
                            wide-ranging informal five-hour discussion (including lunch) of a
                            revitalized pacification program.</p>
                        <p>3. Program has three main elements: (A) General <persName corresp="#p_Co1">Co</persName> will be appointed Deputy Prime
                            Minister for “War and Peace” with overall charge of pacification. Le Van
                            Tien will be appointed Minister of Pacification—an appointment he said
                            he had thought about a great deal, and a man whom he considers very
                            able. Tien has reputation as brilliant braintruster and idea man. A
                            Catholic, he is said to “retain Buddhist tenets”. (B) Special
                            pacification emphasis will be placed on three selected areas. (C) Cadres
                            will be reorganized.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> also intends discuss his
                            ideas with General <persName corresp="#p_Co1">Co</persName> and chiefs
                            of certain selected provinces tomorrow. He asked that <persName corresp="#p_LEG1">Lansdale</persName>'s group meet with him again on
                            October 2 to give him benefit of U.S. views. Accordingly, I called
                            special meeting of Mission Council this morning to discuss new program
                            and to enable us to respond constructively.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>'s program calls for mounting
                            major pacification effort in following selected areas: (A) Prime
                            areas—Danang-Quang Nam area: Binh Dinh Province; Saigon-Cholon-Gia Dinh
                            area; (B) Possible additions: Phu Yen area, Cai Son resettlement area
                            (part of An Giang-Ken Giang Province), Phu Quoc island. Pacification
                            efforts now under way other areas should continue.</p>
                        <p>6. Secondly, he intends to reorganize existing 25,000 cadres in such a
                            way that they would be operationally responsible to Deputy PM for War
                            and Peace to whom new Minister for Rural Construction (Pacification)
                            would also report. Cadres would only receive technical guidance from
                            other interested Ministries. Teams of perhaps 100, composed of 40 PATs
                            and popular forces and 60 public admin, health, works, education, info
                            technicians, would be tailored to needs of each district in Vietnam.
                            Furthermore, he plans establish 4 training centers, [garble] per zone,
                            and give cadres one month of motivational and basic military training.
                            He also plans revitalize concept of national institute of administration
                            and <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0458"/>give selected cadres
                            periods of training there, interspersed with periods of duty in
                            districts.</p>
                        <p>7. Following emerged from U.S. Mission Council discussion:</p>
                        <p>A. Selected areas. While Council generally concurred in concept and
                            location of 3 selected areas, believed that one area from IV Corps
                            should be added to prime targets. Was noted that Danang-Quang Nam and
                            Binh Dinh targets, while in contested areas, are places where increasing
                            U.S. and allied presence will afford solid shield. It is presumed
                            greater Saigon area will correspond roughly to Hop Tac area and that
                            latter will probably be gradually dropped as a separate concept or
                            operation.</p>
                        <p>In sum, Council endorsed idea of a few well-aimed rifle shots rather than
                            buck-shot approach; first emphasis should be on worth and durability of
                            programs in selected areas rather than on number of areas. Hopefully
                            these successes would spread.</p>
                        <p>B. Cadre. Essential that cadres be drawn from local areas whenever
                            possible in order inculcate local responsibility. Existing cadres should
                            be used and reorganized rather than imposing yet another layer of
                            officials. Employment in this cadre should be a substitute for army
                            draft. Council endorsed idea of integrating PAT teams into 100-man
                            teams. District-based mobile cadre should be broken down and assigned to
                            villages. Although it is not clear how <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> sees role of province and district chiefs in this set
                            up, Council believes it best to try use them as part of chain of
                            command, thus helping get government apparatus reestablished in
                            countryside. Relationship to these teams of U.S. military and civilians
                            in field will have to be studied in order best weave together our joint
                            efforts and put resources where they most needed.</p>
                        <p>C. General observations. Important that <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> put over this new program in statesmanlike manner,
                            trying to ensure adhesion all important leadership groups. At same time,
                            in light jaundiced press reaction to somewhat similar schemes that
                            failed in past, publicity on this program should be handled with great
                            caution until some tangible results are actually in hand. Advance notice
                            of areas to be pacified should not be given. In general we all hope this
                            [garble] an historical date for getting more lasting pacification
                            accomplished while taking advantage of the presence of allied combat
                            forces. Weaving all the strands together is complex.</p>

                            these pacification plans.</p>
                        <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> These developments are encouraging and
                            are responsive to our long standing desires. <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> has taken a sensible approach to this
                            all-encompassing problem of pacification, notably his awareness of
                            crucial psychological factor. His designation of a Deputy PM for War and
                            Peace in overall charge of pacification, his concept of telescoping our
                                <pb n="427" xml:id="pg_427" facs="0459"/>joint efforts in a few
                            areas (while normal pacification is continued elsewhere along present
                            lines), and the consolidation of cadres with a more clearly defined line
                            of authority to Saigon, are all steps in the right direction. Finally,
                            we are pleased that <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> has seen
                            fit to engage in this fruitful exchange of views and to seek our advice

                            private talk with no one else present. I told him that following

                            and had been in contact with Hanoi for the purpose of exploring
                            possibilities of peaceful settlement and counter proposals on Hanoi's
                            four points.<note n="4" xml:id="d158fn4">See <ref target="frus1964-68v02#d245">

                            have been uninformed by Hanoi, and did not press for details on the
                            nature of the contact beyond asking whether a third government was
                            involved—to which I replied no.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> refused to acknowledge
                            the basic fact of North Vietnam's infiltration and other action against
                            South Vietnam, but it was quite clear that he surely understood that we
                            knew about such things even if on policy grounds he could not admit it.
                            He said it was his impression that Hanoi could not possibly enter into
                            discussions on negotiations while bombing was going on. His point was
                            that Hanoi looked upon discussion during the bombings as a plea from a
                            position of weakness. I told him that Hanoi was not denying to us the
                            facts of their intervention or the presence of regular units of the
                            North Vietnamese Army. I told him we <pb n="428" xml:id="pg_428" facs="0460"/>were not asking for conditions because we were prepared
                            to talk while the fighting continued or were prepared to have
                            preliminary discussions about circumstances which would permit more
                            formal negotiations to occur. I told him that we had been unable to get
                            from any communist capital the slightest indication as to what would
                            happen if the bombing stopped. We were not asking this question to raise
                            a condition but were simply asking for a simple factual statement as to
                            what consequences any one could see in the direction of making peace.
                            Obviously, if we stopped the bombing and nothing else happened this
                            would be unacceptable.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was much interested in
                            whether contacts with Hanoi had been definitively concluded without
                            result or whether such contacts remained open. I told him that it was my
                            impression that both sides were prepared to renew contact if there was
                            anything interesting to say. His attitude seemed to indicate a hope that
                            whatever channel that was involved would remain open. He did not confirm
                            but did not contradict my remark that there seemed to be some
                            differences of views in Hanoi and that some debate might be going on in
                            that capital.</p>

                            acknowledging that Moscow has a real problem with China than he
                            personally has been with me in the past. For example, in response to a
                            question from me, he stated “very flatly” that he was confident that if
                            Hanoi came to a conference at which the Soviet Union and the United
                            States were present that Peiping would not use force to prevent it.</p>
                        <p>It was significant to me that he showed no bluster or threats about the

                            important matters, and that he was prepared to be relaxed but direct and
                            businesslike in discussing any matters in which we both are involved. He
                            did not attempt to apply pressure nor did he use threats or any of the
                            normal language associated with the rugged discussions of 1961 and

                        <p>Dear John:</p>
                        <p>This is in reply to your letter of September 28.<note n="2" xml:id="d159fn2">Not found.</note> I am not in a position to comment
                            further at this moment on the question of locks and dams, but I would
                            like to respond immediately to your last paragraph referring to the
                            language in paragraph 2 of the State dissent to <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 10-11-65.<note n="3" xml:id="d159fn3">
                                <ref target="#d148">Document 148</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>I have not attempted to go through all of the public statements and press
                            conferences, but it certainly would be my impression that—even though
                            there might not have been specific statements on the question—the
                            various responses indicated generally that we would continue, as far as
                            we could then see, the policy we have been pursuing, which of course
                            does not include attacks on Hanoi and Haiphong. I am confident that our
                            statements have been interpreted in this sense by diplomatic observers
                            and sophisticated newspapermen, and that if Hanoi has any eyes and ears
                            at all the overwhelming reading that has been reported to it is that we
                            were not planning to hit H-H at any early time. I say this despite the
                            fact that the general line of response in all our public statements has
                            been not to exclude such action.</p>
                        <p>As to private indications, I think you know that we have repeatedly been
                            asked point-blank by the British, Japanese, and others whether we
                            intended to extend our bombing to <gloss target="#t_HH1">H-H</gloss>. We
                            have always replied with some care that we had no such current plan,
                            although the time might come when it would be necessary as a part of the
                            over-all pattern of pressure on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.
                            I do not know whether these diplomatic conversations get back to Hanoi,
                            but I would suspect strongly that some of them do.</p>
                        <p>More broadly, the question of hitting <gloss target="#t_HH1">H-H</gloss>
                            has repeatedly come up in background conversations and briefings with
                            Congressional groups and newspapermen. We have taken the same line as
                            with the diplomats, but on occasion, notably with Congressmen, I
                            myself—and I am sure others—have necessarily argued the pros and cons in
                            such a way as to indicate that we certainly did not exclude this but had
                            doubts, as of the time of the statements, that it was likely to bring
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to accept a solution. Again, I
                            think the net of all these discussions must have been an <pb n="430" xml:id="pg_430" facs="0462"/>impression that we would weigh hitting
                                <gloss target="#t_HH1">H-H</gloss> as a very major step and that we
                            were not inclined to do it except for grave reasons or unless there were
                            a clear basis to believe it could significantly help in effecting a
                            favorable resolution of the problem. I cannot help but believe that
                            discussions with these groups necessarily percolate into the bloodstream
                            of Washington, and reach Communist ears which in turn pass them to
                            Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>On one specific point, I would like to flag that we have seen one TDCS,
                            brought to our attention by Andy Goodpaster, in which a <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> representative was quoted as telling
                            his Soviet contact that we had no plan to hit the <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> sites because Soviet personnel were
                            present. This was not an authorized statement, and we have flagged it to
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of all this, I do not suppose any of us can say what the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> leaders really think we intend.
                            The massive air defense effort in Hanoi strongly suggests the assumption
                            that we will eventually hit <gloss target="#t_HH1">H-H</gloss>. But I do
                            think that the statement in the paragraph in question—that there have
                            been many “official indications, public and private,” to the contrary,
                            at least for the present—does represent the fact. It may be that the
                            sentence is a shade overstated, in light of our consistent refusal to
                            exclude such action at some time, but I think the inevitable thrust of
                            all our statements has been in the direction indicated.</p>
                        <p>In any case, whether the sentence could have been improved or not, those
                            of use who saw the <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> dissent—and this
                            included Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>,
                            Alex Johnson, <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Len Unger</persName>, and
                            myself—would still agree with its essential point, namely that the
                            Communists (and non-Communists) would feel that the program discussed in
                            the Estimate would in fact represent a very major change in our level of
                            action.</p>
                        <p>I am writing this to meet your deadline of October 1, and without having
                            dug up the relevant memoranda of conversations and briefing notes in any
                            detail. But I am confident that I have summed up fairly what has been
                            said. I do want to conclude by assuring you and General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> that we have no intention of
                            changing the line we have taken consistently, basically that we are not
                            excluding this or any other action. Obviously, we must not say anything
                            that could impair our freedom of action or the President's freedom of
                            choice on future actions.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> asked the Secretary his
                            views on the situation in Viet Nam. He asked if the Secretary could see
                            any way out.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that this would depend on what Hanoi is willing to do
                            with respect to its own actions in South Viet Nam. The United States is
                            in South Viet Nam solely because of the infiltration from North Viet Nam
                            to South Viet Nam of armed men and munitions. If this infiltration would
                            stop, we could go home. But we want to be sure that South Viet Nam can
                            solve its problems without armed pressure from the North.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary went on to say that he had received the impression that
                            differing and sometimes contradictory attitudes had become apparent in
                            Hanoi of late. We think Moscow would be prepared to take part in a
                            conference if Hanoi would assent. It is Peiping which says no. Hanoi is
                            somewhere between the two but currently leaning toward Peiping.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> said that, in his opinion,
                            as long as the United States continues to bomb North Viet Nam, no
                            discussion could take place.<note n="3" xml:id="d160fn3">

                                50, October 7, summarized this conversation. The cable also noted
                                that after the discussion, <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> was interviewed by the press at some length
                                and he repeated his belief that a cessation of the bombing was an
                                indispensable first step to creating an atmosphere necessary for
                                negotiations. (Department of State, EA/ACA Files: Lot 69 D 412,

                            difficult to see what advantage can be gained from the continuance of
                            these air attacks.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary recalled that large-scale infiltration South of the 17th
                            parallel began in 1959 and 1960; we have waited four years before
                            beginning the bombing of North Viet Nam.</p>
                        <pb n="432" xml:id="pg_432" facs="0464"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> made the point that there
                            had been no advance warning of these bombings and no opportunity for
                            negotiations. The Secretary said that the United States had tried every
                            means before the bombings began—all of this is a matter of record. At
                            any rate, the United States has learned since that holding off does not
                            produce a peaceful settlement. In various ways we have tried to ask the
                            question, “What will happen if we stop the bombing; what will this lead
                            to?”</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that we have asked Hanoi what will happen and
                            get no answer. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> says to
                            wait and see. But the bombing and killing goes on every day in South
                            Viet Nam. What is the difference whether explosives are carried by a man
                            on foot or delivered in planes from the air? If we stop the bombing,
                            will the North Viet Namese troops go home? Will the Communists come to
                            the conference table?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> expressed his conviction
                            that, if the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> answered such questions
                            as to their intent while the bombing continues or the threat of bombing
                            is still present, it would be regarded by the world as an indication of
                            their weakness. The DRV does not want to look weak.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that, by the same logic, the reverse would be true
                            if we stopped bombing before we received any indication of intent from
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> said nobody could seriously
                            believe that the United States would stop the bombings out of
                            weakness.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary saw a difference in opinion on this point. Peiping is
                            continually preaching that the United States is a “paper tiger”.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CY1">Chen Yi</persName> enjoins the Soviet
                            Union not to take such a gloomy view of war. We take a very gloomy view
                            of war, indeed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary was of the opinion that there should be some way to avoid
                            the impression of weakness. We don't think that there can really be any
                            misjudgment on this score. If “face” or public posture is involved,
                            surely some private arrangement can be made. We are prepared to stop
                            bombing if we can be assured that this is a step toward peace.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> said that it certainly would
                            be a step toward peace. It would create the atmosphere which is
                            necessary to bring all the factors for peaceful negotiation into play.
                            In the present situation, however, Hungary is not able to propose
                            negotiations to its friends in North Viet Nam. The Soviets are in the
                            same position.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that part of the answer lies in Peiping. What will
                            Hanoi do if Peiping says no?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> said that the Hungarians
                            have some direct contacts with Hanoi. He mentioned that a Hungarian
                            delegation is scheduled to arrive in Hanoi today. <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName>'s firm conviction was that the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> is ready to negotiate but that
                            certain conditions must be met. Yet, while North Viet Nam is being
                            bombed or under the threat of bombing, any talks are impossible.</p>
                        <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0465"/>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that this works both ways. There is also
                            bombing in South Viet Nam.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> said that this situation
                            will continue as long as there is no improvement in the attitude of the
                            United States. The United States should show its goodwill in this
                            matter. The halt in the bombing last summer was not effective because
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> was still under the threat of
                            renewed attack.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that Hanoi had not shown any indication of a
                            desire to talk at that time. In fact, they just sent our message back
                            and stuck it under our door. Three days later <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> termed our suspension of
                            bombing “an insult”.</p>
                        <p>We have indicated our willingness to settle this problem not only to the
                            other side, but to our own people. The Secretary said he had repeatedly
                            indicated his willingness to depart “tomorrow” if any one wanted to
                            talk. We have said that we will come to the conference table, we will
                            agree to a cease-fire in the event that a conference is imminent, or
                            that we will come home if the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> stops
                            its aggression. We have repeatedly said that we want no bases in South
                            Viet Nam and that when the fighting in Viet Nam could be stopped we will
                            join in an economic development project for Southeast Asia.<note n="4" xml:id="d160fn4">The next paragraph began with the sentence: “We are
                                not rabbits to be frightened by a snake.” It was apparently erased
                                in the Secretary's office, but remains legible on the source
                                text.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>If the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> continues its aggression, the
                            war will continue. It is that simple. How do we deal with that
                            situation? <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> said that a
                            decrease of military action would be a start. There is no other way to
                            decrease military action but to halt the bombing of North Viet Nam.
                            Otherwise escalation will continue with all its dangers.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that escalation is the tragedy. If the war continues
                            to escalate, North Viet Nam will be destroyed. Why do we have to go down
                            that road?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> replied that the key to the
                            matter is in United States hands. If bombing is halted, conditions will
                            improve, and negotiations leading to peace will be possible.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we would get nowhere if such unilateral action
                            meant our acceptance of a program of the “liberation movement”.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> reiterated that the
                            conditions necessary to negotiations would arise if the United States
                            stopped its bombing. It would be impossible to get any guarantee from
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> until after the cessation of
                            bombing.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that we cannot move very long on a unilateral
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> said that before the United
                            States started its air attacks there had been no real proposal for
                            negotiations on the situation in South Viet <pb n="434" xml:id="pg_434" facs="0466"/>Nam. The air attacks began without notification thus,
                            if the United States stops its bombing, it is not purely a unilateral
                            concession, but a new start to try to find a solution.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked how long <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName>
                            felt it would take for the other side to enter negotiations after the
                            proposed halting of air attacks.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> replied certainly a few
                            weeks, provided the attacks were stopped without the threat of renewal.
                            The United States would not lose anything by it and the rest of the
                            world would surely gain.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that there are traditional ways and means of
                            coming to an understanding on such matters as this. In the past history
                            of such disputes, there have been means of making clear the
                            possibilities for peaceful settlement which existed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> remarked that, while the
                            bombings continue, any prior indication on the part of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> that it is willing to negotiate would
                            be a sign of weakness. They would think that the United States had
                            gotten what it wanted, namely negotiations, through military action.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that it is, indeed, very difficult to get the idea of
                            reciprocity across this ideological gulf. If Hanoi thought it could
                            succeed in achieving its objectives in this way, would the DRV come to
                            the conference table?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> said that it may be a long
                            way to the conference table.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary feared that Hanoi takes an exaggerated view of the force of
                            international opinion. We have consulted with most governments on the
                            problem of North Viet Nam and we know what they think. Hanoi may well
                            believe that, if we stop, the force of world opinion may prevent us from
                            resuming the air attacks. Thus the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            believes they will have an advantage if we stop.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> said that this would not be
                            a unilateral advantage. The United States would gain much more in the
                            way of international support if the air attacks were stopped.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he supposed there was always universal support for the
                            idea of a peaceful settlement, except in Hanoi and Peiping. Some
                            countries, however, feel themselves unable to express their support
                            until Hanoi assents to negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then recalled the manner in which Peiping had torpedoed the
                            conference on Laos and Cambodia. He said that we understand the
                            difficulties currently present in the Socialist world. But it does seem
                            to us that Hanoi has the key.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that, if Hanoi comes to the conference table with the
                            United States and the Soviet Union, Peiping would hesitate to interfere,
                            at least with force. Therefore, Hanoi holds the key. It simply doesn't
                            appear that Hanoi is ready to make any effort toward a peaceful
                            solution. If they wish to do so, there are ways and means of letting us
                            know.</p>
                        <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0467"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> said that as long as the
                            present situation continues, there can be no change in the attitude of
                            Hanoi. The bombing must cease.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked what, besides the bombing, would cease. There must be
                            some reciprocal action on the part of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> was certain that reciprocal
                            action would come, perhaps on the ground as well. It is impossible to
                            get both sides to move at once.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked why, at a very private level and in the most
                            sophisticated manner, is it necessary for one party to move in advance
                            of the other. This is not the traditional way to negotiate.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> didn't agree. The Secretary
                            then reminded him that, as an example, we had contacts with the Soviet
                            Union while Berlin was still under blockade.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> termed such contacts as of a
                            special nature and well-established.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then explained that the United States has no national
                            ambitions in Southeast Asia. South Viet Nam can be non-aligned, if it is
                            left alone. We want no military bases in Viet Nam. But we do feel
                            strongly about a small nation being overrun by force. Thus, there is an
                            enormous gap between our attitude and that of Peiping.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> said that, if the United
                            States has no ambitions in that area, the points of agreement between
                            the two sides are much closer than they seem. The main thing now is to
                            stop the bombing. For Hungary, as a Socialist country, it is impossible
                            to talk to friends in the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> about
                            negotiations while the bombing goes on. Peter went on to point out that
                            the air attacks are different from the ground fighting in South Viet
                            Nam.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he found it difficult to accept a distinction between
                            the bombing and the fighting in South Viet Nam. <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> repeated his certainty that the
                            key is in the hands of the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that, in conflict, surely the key is in the hands
                            of both sides.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> said that the United States
                            is the major power in this case.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that other elements entered into the picture. When
                            campaigning for re-election, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had told the American people that we did not
                            wish a larger war in Viet Nam. After the President had won the election,
                            Hanoi evidently misunderstood the meaning of the President's victory.
                            They thought that they could expand the war without danger of response
                            from the United States.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> said that, if the United
                            States were to stop the bombing, it could still maintain “all the
                            present possibilities” if Hanoi acted in bad faith. He then asked the
                            Secretary whether he had anything favorable to say on this whole
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that he had been very interested in hearing
                                <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName>'s views. He couldn't say
                            more than he had already said. The whole <pb n="436" xml:id="pg_436" facs="0468"/>matter needs further exploration. The greatest
                            difficulty is the absence of any reciprocal intent on the part of the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> told the Secretary that
                            reciprocity would come.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he did not want to mislead Peter. We have thought very
                            hard about this problem and we want peace very much. It is too late in
                            history for war; no one understands this better than we. Most of the
                            great powers understand the dangers of war, with the signal exception of
                            Peiping. This creates problems in the Socialist world as well as in the
                            West.</p>
                        <p>Suppose that we stop the bombing and the Chinese calculate that they can
                            intervene in safety?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> thought that this was an
                            extremely unlikely possibility.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary felt that, nevertheless, we would have heavy responsibility
                            if such should be the result.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> said that there could not be
                            any danger in stopping. It would change the whole atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary recalled one of the deepest disappointments the United
                            States has ever experienced—the failure of President Kennedy's fresh
                            approach on Laos. The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> never did
                            reduce its forces in Laos more than a few thousand men and continued to
                            use Laos as a base to infiltrate South Viet Nam. Everyone was ready for
                            a peaceful settlement but it didn't work.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> remarked that if one binds
                            one's hands as a result of bad experiences one will never get out of a
                            bad situation.</p>
                        <p>In return, the Secretary quoted an old saying of American horse traders:
                            “If someone cheats me once it is his fault; if he cheats me twice it is
                            my fault.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> said that the United States
                            would have many good friends supporting it if there was a cessation of
                            bombing. This would include the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that, since both he and <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> were Calvinists, we will continue to give the
                            entire matter “our prayerful Presbyterian consideration.” He wanted to
                            make it clear that he had not made any promise or commitment to Peter.
                            He expressed his appreciation for the opportunity for talking with
                                Peter.<note n="5" xml:id="d160fn5">This last paragraph was typed on

                        <p>On October 7, 1965, from 12:45 to 1:50 p.m., President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> met with Secretary of Defense
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, Acting Secretary
                            of State <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, and McGeorge
                            Bundy. Bundy left the meeting at 1:20 and <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> left at 1:30 p.m. (Johnson Library, President's
                            Daily Diary) No other record of this meeting has been found, except an
                            agenda that lists Vietnam as one of four items to be discussed. Under
                            Vietnam are three sub-topics: “1. Rolling Thunder, 2. New voluntary
                            organization, 3. Domestic debate.” (Ibid., National Security File, Memos
                            to the President, McGeorge Bundy, Vol. XV)</p>
                        <p>According to a memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William
                                Bundy</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>,
                            October 7, the Department of Defense informed the Department of State
                            that Rolling Thunder was not to be a topic for discussion at the October
                            7 meeting with the President. (Department of State, Vietnam Working
                            Group Files: Lot 72 D 219, Rolling Thunder—1965) The reference to a new
                            voluntary organization is apparently to efforts by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RH1">Howard Rusk</persName> to extend voluntary medical
                            services and personnel to South Vietnam's war victims and veterans. An

                            previewed the upcoming demonstrations of October 15-16 in the United
                            States and abroad against the Vietnam war and discussed the composition
                            of the protest movement within the United States. (Ibid., Country File,

                                State informed him in the telegram that he should not make contact
                                with <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> representatives who might be in Vienna, but rather
                                work through the Red Cross representative. <persName corresp="#p_SAP1">Schwartz</persName> should also “downplay the

                                “might signal the beginning of something more important.”
                                (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27-7 VIET)</note> embolden me to make following
                            comments:</p>
                        <p>2. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName>'s assertion that “US
                            has nothing to lose by cessation of bombing” is manifestly untrue.
                            Bombing is our strongest current weapon against Viet Cong aggression and
                            to cease it, in the way in which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> suggests, would be a very serious blow both to our
                            effort in Vietnam and to that of the Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>3. Believe the Secretary was absolutely right to reaffirm US
                            position.</p>
                        <p>4. It is extraordinary to one who worked eight years at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to find such apparently widespread
                            indifference to the concept of aggression the prevention of which is,
                            after all, one of the prime aims of the Charter. Yet, if the press is
                            any guide, it is seldom mentioned. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> is right in all that he has said about
                            suppressing aggression. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> rests on
                            the principle that it is wrong to use force except in self-defense. If
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> does violence to that principle it
                            will cease to deserve respect. Our actions in Vietnam are in full accord
                            with purposes of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter, rooted
                            in Article I, “Measures for the … Suppression of Acts of
                            Aggression.”</p>
                        <p>5. One of the most effective things which we can do to ward off
                            aggression and promote peace is our bombing in the north. There should
                            be no pause from us without a pause from them. If we stop cutting roads
                            and blowing up bridges in the north, let them stop doing the same thing
                            in the south, or stop destroying the railroad. A proposition whereby
                            their side is allowed to do with impunity the things which we are not to
                            be allowed to do is manifestly unacceptable.</p>
                        <pb n="439" xml:id="pg_439" facs="0471"/>
                        <p>6. The agitation for a pause should not be taken at face value. When it
                            comes from one of the so called non-aligned countries, it often
                            represents a response to an organized minority more than it represents
                            what the government really thinks.</p>
                        <p>7. We must avoid steps which: will cause the Hanoi regime to think we are
                            weak and near defeat; of being believed in South Vietnam to be about to
                            negotiate in a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to which <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> does not belong and behind their backs;
                            of thus lowering morale and destroying an important quantity of
                            Vietnamese fighting power which our own fighting men will have to pay
                            for; or in general, of giving up something and really getting nothing
                            back.</p>

                        <p>There is no accurate estimate of the current number of refugees in
                            Vietnam. Best guesses hover around 600,000 and more (possibly as much as
                            400,000 more) by December. Although there are refugees in virtually
                            every provincial capital, the major concentrations are in I and II
                            Corps.</p>
                        <p>Refugees have flowed in from a variety of causes: floods, <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> repression, rice shortages, and the
                            destruction of villages by military (<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            and U.S.-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>) action. If one can
                            generalize at all, the refugees are largely apolitical; the vast
                            majority are children, women and elderly folk with no special
                            skills.</p>
                        <p>Conditions in the refugee camps are probably not too bad from the
                            physical point of view when compared to the general standards of the <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440" facs="0472"/>country as a whole, which is
                            not to say that there aren't serious problems of food and shelter. But
                            it is the political-psychological aspect of the problem which needs
                            careful attention; the refugees represent a potential source of
                            disaffection and unrest exploitable by the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            Approach</p>
                        <p>Despite the enormity of the problem and the prodding of the U.S. Mission,
                            there is a lack of interest, planning and action at the top levels of
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. This is reflected in
                            uncertainty and confusion at the province level. The Commanders of I and
                            II Corps regard the refugee problem as a tactical one and take the view
                            that additional refugees should be turned away from the existing centers
                            and that resettlement of those in the centers should be undertaken
                            immediately.</p>
                        <p>In a country where poverty and misery are so widespread and where social
                            welfare resources are spread so thin, it is not unnatural that refugees
                            are regarded as an unnecessary burden by the government. Moreover, there
                            are many instances where refugees in well-run and well-supplied centers
                            are much better off than non-refugees nearby. The Government is
                            justifiably concerned that “model” centers will simply attract “rice
                            refugees”.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s Ministry of Social Welfare is
                            the executive agency for the care of refugees and in terms of its
                            resources and capabilities, is doing what it can. But it is not big
                            enough for the job. Enter the U.S.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The U.S. Program</p>
                        <p>The U.S. Mission has been concerned with the refugee problem since the
                            major floods of last April. With the increase of Viet Cong activity in
                            II Corps and the stepped-up military activity of late spring and summer
                            the refugee rolls began to swell and U.S. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and private efforts expanded. During the summer <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> established a Refugee Task Force and
                            a coordinator for refugee matters was appointed until <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> could recruit a refugee expert. Several
                            Task Force teams were dispatched to the principal refugee centers.</p>
                        <p>In September a Refugee Relief Division was established in <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and a Vietnam relief coordinator was
                            appointed in Washington. Sixteen specialists in relief and refugee
                            problems have been recruited for the Relief Division and most are
                            already in place. The Chief of this Division (Ed Marks) and I have had
                            two useful sessions; he will leave this weekend for Saigon.</p>
                        <p>At least as important, is an overall policy and program which was
                            developed in consultation with the Ministry of Social Welfare. (It is
                            hoped that General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> will soon
                            announce his Government's interest in and policy toward the refugee
                            problem.) The operative concept for <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> is to “advise and recommend”, but also to be ready to
                            compensate <pb n="441" xml:id="pg_441" facs="0473"/>for gaps in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> capabilities. We must, however, make
                            sure that this is basically and conspicuously a <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> program.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Voluntary Agencies</p>
                        <p>The principal agencies now operating in Vietnam are CARE, the Church
                            World Service (primarily Mennonites), the Catholic Relief Service, and
                            the Friends. Each of these agencies, with our urging and encouragement,
                            are expanding their activities and some agencies not now active in
                            Vietnam (notably the Lutherans) may soon undertake programs there. Most
                            of these agencies intend to intensify their fund-raising activities
                            (CARE has already launched theirs) to finance these expanded
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>In my own contacts with them, in their testimony to the Kennedy
                            Subcommittee, and in discussions with <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> officials, the voluntary agencies have revealed a great
                            sensitivity to coordination by a new “umbrella” group and infringement
                            of their sovereignty in fund raising. They are taking steps to increase
                            their coordination effort (which the more candid admit has been thus far
                            unsatisfactory) through their trade association, the American Council of
                            Voluntary Agencies.</p>
                        <p>Representatives of about 7 key Voluntary Agencies will leave for Vietnam
                            in about a week for a five-day investigation. They are scheduled to
                            return to Washington before Senator Kennedy arrives in Vietnam in late
                            October.</p>

                        <p>This group, a non-legislative subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee,
                            became interested in the Vietnam problem in late June. It has held a
                            large number of hearings, but transcripts are hard to come by (I have
                            obtained several involving the Voluntary Agencies). According to
                            Committee staff members, the Report will be prepared around mid-November
                            following the Senator's return from Vietnam. I suggest we get a reading
                            on Senator Kennedy's thinking before he leaves and before we get too
                            deeply into our Foundation. Should I endeavor to do this? (Yes__

                        </p>
                        <p>The increased military power we are bringing to bear in South Viet-Nam
                            must have made the Viet Cong realize that we are going to make a
                            determined and serious effort to destroy their capability. As this power
                            makes itself felt, they will probably decide in the near future to break
                            up most of their large units and to move toward one or the other of two
                            strategies: <pb n="443" xml:id="pg_443" facs="0475"/>They may change
                            their tactics in the direction of small acts of terror and sabotage; or
                            less likely, they could adopt an even more passive strategy of
                            apparently “fading into the woodwork.”</p>
                        <p>The purpose of the latter strategy would be to cause a cessation in
                            United States pressures, north and south, until a more propitious
                            moment. This would not be easy for the Viet Cong to accomplish; they
                            would have problems of morale, organization, etc. But if it were
                            attempted it would face us with a critical point of decision with regard
                            to bombing of the north. Two sharply divergent theses could be argued.
                            On the one hand it could be argued that a step-up in bombing of the
                            north would be justified in this circumstance since we could not permit
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to turn the pressure on and off at
                            their convenience. Stepped up bombing would be designed to force the
                            issue. On the other hand, it could be argued, probably more
                            convincingly, that the bombing should be reduced, perhaps in proportion
                            to the reduction in military activity in the south. This would assume
                            that the pacification program could be pursued successfully and that the
                            United States could persevere in its political and military commitments
                            recognizing that to effectuate the pacification program will take a long
                            period, perhaps years. Though we do not believe we are yet at the
                            preceding point of decision, we do believe that it should be anticipated
                            and the groundwork laid for reaching the necessary policy decisions when
                            and if required.</p>
                        <p>It is unlikely, however, that our actions in the south have made them
                            ready to switch from a military to a political strategy, and they are
                            unlikely to do so for a matter of months at best. They will in all
                            likelihood recede from “Stage 3” and pursue a strategy of active
                            guerrilla hit-and-run strikes, terror and sabotage. They will continue
                            to oppose negotiations except upon their own terms until such time as it
                            becomes clear to them that we will stay the course and successfully, if
                            gradually, push them back into the woodwork and begin a discernible
                            trend toward pacification of most of the country. The more immediate
                            question, therefore, is what our policy should be with regard to bombing
                            the north in the interim, that is, during the period when the intensity
                            of our own effort in the south is growing, when the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are pursuing a “1963-4” or “Stage 2”
                            strategy, and when the question whether the VC will recede to “Stage 1”
                            is still unclear.</p>
                        <p>It is now obvious that we shall probably be faced with the prospect of a
                            continuation of our present courses of action, including the bombing of
                            North Viet-Nam, for many months more. The present rate of escalation of
                            our bombing, however, is bringing us to a point where in a few months
                            further escalation will be possible only by attacking sensitive targets
                            which may pose, in acute form for the other side, the issue of greater
                            Chinese and/or Soviet involvement. We are beginning to attack the last
                            remaining geographic area apart from the area around Hanoi and Haiphong.
                                <pb n="444" xml:id="pg_444" facs="0476"/>We may be able to recognize
                            the optimum time for exerting further pressure by increasing the level
                            of our bombing but an increase in our bombing of the North at the
                            present time may bring matters to a head too soon.</p>
                        <p>It does not appear to us necessary that there be a pronounced escalation
                            in our bombing at the present time since our present activities, while
                            not destroying the military and economic capacity of North Viet-Nam, are
                            causing great strain as indicated in the letters quoted in Annex B.<note n="3" xml:id="d164fn3">Not found.</note> (As noted below, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> and Mr. Bundy would
                            interpret the permissible continuing level of bombing somewhat more
                            narrowly than would General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName>.) Moreover, the effects of our present
                            attacks are to some extent cumulative and are bringing a steady increase
                            of pressure on Hanoi. The impressive reports of the growing number of
                            targets destroyed or damaged in the daily armed reconnaissance reports
                            illustrate this. We therefore believe we should more or less level off
                            at about the present rate of bombing in the North. For the present, we
                            should not attack the most sensitive targets, large dams, Phuc Yen and
                            the Hanoi/Haiphong area before January 1, 1966. Though we would not
                            initially recommend hitting such targets as thermal power plants, as we
                            begin to exhaust profitable targets, we might begin very gradually to
                            nibble at some of the industrial targets.</p>
                        <p>The northeast quadrant presents a special problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> would favor maintaining
                            approximately the present level of attacks; i.e. about four or five
                            missions every two weeks against major LOC targets, to assure
                            destruction of the railroad. These missions should include specific
                            armed recce to prevent daylight movement on the roads. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> would prefer a slight increase
                            from the present level. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> and Mr. Bundy feel that the present level of
                            activity might well tempt the North Viet-Namese to throw their <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>s into the equation and that this, aside
                            from its intrinsic disadvantages, could lead to a succession of events
                            broadening hostilities still further. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> and Mr. Bundy would favor a
                            reduction to approximately one attack on the railroad every two weeks
                            and no armed recce except in very special cases and limited to specific
                            targets.</p>
                        <p>We also conclude that serious consideration should be given to employment
                            of a pause. Though it would have to be carefully managed, its objective
                            would be to provide an opportunity for the north to give concrete
                            evidence of a willingness to come to terms, an evidence which it is
                            difficult, in a political and psychological sense, for it to give while
                            under the pressure of our bombing. We would have to exercise great care
                            that a mere willingness to initiate negotiations would not in and of
                            itself <pb n="445" xml:id="pg_445" facs="0477"/>qualify for an
                            indefinite moratorium on the bombing. We would have to convey our intent
                            to reinstitute bombing if the North Viet-Namese refused to negotiate or
                            if their willingness to negotiate is not accompanied by a manifest
                            reduction of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> aggression in the south.
                            If it is necessary to reinstitute bombing, we should be prepared to
                            consider increasing the pressure, e.g. through striking industrial
                            targets, to make clear to Hanoi our continuing, firm resolve.</p>
                        <p>In summation, we conclude that:</p>
                        <p>1. the present escalation in the bombing of the north is likely to become
                            increasingly out of phase with the progress of our military operations
                            in the south. It would thus run the risk of forcing the other side
                            prematurely to face the issue of negotiations or greater Chinese and
                            Soviet involvement.</p>
                        <p>2. we should therefore level off our bombing of the north (with some
                            variance of views among us as to permissible levels in the northeast
                            quadrant, see above) for the interim.</p>
                        <p>3. we may well be faced with the prospect of altered Viet Cong strategy
                            in the south which will require a reevaluation of our policy on bombing
                            of the north and that this problem should be anticipated and study of
                            its implications begun at once and finally,</p>
                        <p>4. that a pause in the bombing should be considered, recognizing that it
                            may be a prerequisite to establishing the political and psychological
                            framework for initiating negotiations, but recognizing also that unless
                            carefully managed it contains dangerous pitfalls.</p>

                        <p>1269. Subject: Vietnamese attitudes.</p>
                        <p>1. Completion of <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> government's
                            first hundred days seems an appropriate moment to review Vietnamese
                            attitudes toward the government. In general, on the basis of contacts
                            with opinion molders within key groups, one is forced to the conclusion
                            that the Vietnamese continue <pb n="446" xml:id="pg_446" facs="0478"/>to
                            be fence-sitters. There is no evidence of any rise in public acceptance
                            of <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> government, and the various
                            key groups appear to be awaiting some demonstration of performance on
                            the part of the government, although there is little clarity as to what
                            form such performance might take. It seems noteworthy that there was
                            little editorial reaction to <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>'s
                            hundred day speech in vernacular press and what comment there was seemed
                            perfunctory and unenthusiastic. One can only deduce that the editors
                            chose not to react to the speech because they were aware that critical
                            commentary would be censored. Press, in general, continues to be
                            somewhat unsympathetic toward the <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> government. This unhappiness has, in part, a selfish
                            base, stemming from government's attempts to control the number of
                            newspapers and their opinions.</p>
                        <p>2. Within individual groups, general attitude seems to be as follows:</p>
                        <p>A. Catholics. <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> government is for
                            the moment acceptable to some Catholic groups but there is no great
                            enthusiasm for it. Northern refugees and southerners alike are still
                            devoted to idea of civilian government. They are prepared to give Ky a
                            further grace period but they will be watching every move the government
                            makes and will be prepared to criticize when they feel their interests
                            are in danger. Catholic daily Xay Dung continues to display friendly
                            attitude toward <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> but paper is
                            the personal vehicle of Father Nguyen Quang Lam, a friend of <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>'s, and no great importance should be
                            attached to it.</p>
                        <p>B. Buddhists. <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> continues
                            to indicate his displeasure with present government. However, he has not
                            shown any inclination to mount a full-scale campaign to bring it down.
                            He has taken line that it will, in time, collapse of its own weight.
                            Fact of matter probably is that Quang has not been able to find an issue
                            with which he might rally a significant following in an anti-government
                            campaign. Quang probably found instructive the failure of the student
                            campaign in Hue in August to achieve much backing. <persName corresp="#p_TC1">Tam Chau</persName> continues to talk on what is
                            apparently a friendly and frequent basis with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>. Chau has told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> that he believes Viet-Nam needs
                            a government that can stay in place at least two years, thus signalling
                            his intention not to oppose the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. The
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is extending substantial support
                            to the <gloss target="#t_UBA1">UBA</gloss> (e.g., Van Hanh University)
                            which undoubtedly makes it easier for Chau to support it. There seems to
                            be a parallel between the current state of play within the <gloss target="#t_UBA1">UBA</gloss> vis-a-vis the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and that which existed during the early days of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_Khanh1">Khanh</persName> government. At that
                            time, <persName corresp="#p_TC1">Chau</persName> was able to assure that
                            the <gloss target="#t_UBA1">UBA</gloss> would not oppose the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. This equilibrium proved fragile then
                            and could prove equally fragile now, especially since preparations are
                            now underway for the biennial meeting of the Unified Buddhist
                            Association (<gloss target="#t_UBA1">UBA</gloss>) in December at which
                                <persName corresp="#p_TC1">Chau</persName> will be re-elected or a
                            successor will be chosen.</p>
                        <pb n="447" xml:id="pg_447" facs="0479"/>
                        <p>C. Sudistes. There is no great affection for <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> government amongst southern politicians or
                            southerners in general. <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> is
                            regarded as a brash young man from the north and despite the presence of
                            certain southerners in the Cabinet, his government is not considered
                            representative of the southerners. As has so often been the case in the
                            past, the southerners lack the organization and energy to make their
                            displeasure known in any concerted fashion. Nevertheless, their attitude
                            prevents <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> from being able to
                            rally support within mass of the Vietnamese people, ten million of whom
                            are, after all, Cochin-Chinese.</p>
                        <p>D. Military. In wake of the September 11 Armed Forces Convention at
                            Saigon, the army continues to give the impression of being unified.
                            Directorate members also provide a public impression of unity. In August
                            and September, General <persName corresp="#p_NCT1">Nguyen Chanh
                                Thi</persName> supported <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> against
                            agitators in Hue, and this display of Directorate unity undoubtedly
                            contributed to easing the situation. Lately, however, we have heard
                            rumblings that command changes announced by <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> at his October 1 press conference were not well
                            received in some quarters (e.g., certain southern officers view
                            appointments of Generals Nguyen Bao Tri and <persName corresp="#p_NDT1">Nguyen Duc Thang</persName> as further evidence that northerners
                            are gradually taking over all key positions within the military). All
                            this demonstrates that Directorate unity is a fragile thing, constantly
                            subjected to divisive forces. It will require frequent
                            reaffirmation.</p>
                        <p>E. Student-intellectuals. Student-intellectual group has recorded its
                            unhappiness with the <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>
                            government. Hue student newspaper is continuing to publish despite
                            general <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName>'s open expression of
                            displeasure and has not restricted its criticism of the military regime.
                            Intellectuals, after their late August seminar in Hue, have not as yet
                            organized a promised follow-up meeting in Saigon. Individually, however,
                            they continue to voice their dislike of the military and wish for a
                            civilian government. This group, despite its articulateness, has little
                            power unless it can draw on the Buddhist mass.</p>
                        <p>F. Labor. Tran Quoc Buu's <gloss target="#t_CVT1">CVT</gloss> raised
                            threat of general strike at the beginning of September. Immediate cause
                            for <gloss target="#t_CVT1">CVT</gloss> grievance was rigid enforcement
                            by government of a <persName corresp="#p_Diem1">Diem</persName> era
                            decree prescribing 48-hour advance notice before trade union meetings
                            could be scheduled. <gloss target="#t_CVT1">CVT</gloss> felt this
                            procedure unduly restrictive if applied to public meetings held in union
                            offices. Behind this issue, however, were other grievances: workers'
                            dissatisfaction with regime's failure to cope with rising cost of living
                            and to provide solutions to accumulated specific labor problems, denial
                            of exit visas to permit attendance at international meetings, and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> refusal to discuss grievances.</p>
                        <p>3. By and large, Vietnamese populace seems convinced that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> will not now be able to achieve a
                            military victory. Thus, this fear no longer preoccupies their attention.
                            Neither is there any longer any doubt <pb n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0480"/>about US intention. Main preoccupations of the
                            Vietnamese now are their concern over the damage being inflicted on
                                <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> as the war intensifies and their
                            concern over their economic problems. Cost of living has risen sharply
                            in last year, particularly in period since <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> government came to power. Costs of basic commodities
                            have increased an average of 33 percent since this time last year.
                            Significant fraction of that increase has been registered since June 19,
                            when <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> government was formed and
                            great build-up of American forces became apparent. In the minds of the
                            city dwellers and those Vietnamese in regions where the American buildup
                            has been most obvious, an unfortunate equation of American presence with
                            rising prices has asserted itself. Editorials have begun to appear in
                            certain Saigon dailies (notably the Buddhist Institute organ Chanh Dao)
                            which, though they do not directly criticize the American presence,
                            nevertheless take line that the sharp increase in the number of
                            foreigners in Viet-Nam endangers Vietnamese culture and national way of
                            life. Hanoi and the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> can be counted
                            upon to encourage public dissatisfaction, building upon daily
                            irritations and complaints about the cost of living, in order to develop
                            an active hostility to the American presence, something which has not
                            previously been a factor here.</p>

                        <p>1. Trend of the war</p>
                        <p>A. General <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName>, Chief of
                            State, during a call by me to present <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> visitors, made a rather sweeping review of the whole
                            situation, during the course of which he said:</p>
                        <p>B. He would not be surprised if the Viet Cong eventually accepted an
                            offer to negotiate—as soon as they were convinced that they could not
                            achieve a military victory with main force units, as guerrilla doctrine
                            prescribes. The purpose of accepting the offer to negotiate would be to
                            end or suspend U.S. military activities, presumably in the expectation
                            that the effect on public opinion in the U.S. would be such that it
                            would be difficult, if not impossible, for us to continue
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>C. He believed that for the last three months, the Viet Cong had been
                            training political cadres to go into the communities in Vietnam and win
                            the war politically which they had been unable to win militarily. He
                            thought there might be as many as 150,000 such cadres. It would mean 5
                            Viet Cong political cadremen where now there was one. He spoke of a
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> demobilization following an
                            armistice, with the demobilized men returning to their villages to
                            become active Communist political subversive workers. They were already
                            taking credit for the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            economic and social programs. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> was
                            wholly unready for such a political contest. I reported the same from
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Tran Van Do</persName> in
                            my wire to you of 30 Sept.<note n="3" xml:id="d166fn3">
                                <ref target="#d157">Document 157</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>D. There was no doubt in Thieu's mind that they “could beat us
                            politically now”, not because of their appeal, but because of their
                            superior organization. Evidence available to me indicates only about 15
                            per cent “sympathize” with the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and
                            that an aversion to Communist methods, particularly to ChiCom
                            domination, continues strong. But these are no substitute for terrorism
                            and poor <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> operations. Incidentally, a
                            recent survey indicates 97 percent of the people know the U.S. is
                            helping, with good opinions of Americans prevailing over bad, and 81
                            percent believing that Americans are here mainly to prevent Communism.
                            Thieu recognized that his view about negotiation was frankly a guess but
                            he seemed absolutely certain that as soon as the Viet Cong were
                            convinced that they could not win militarily, they would switch their
                            effort to gain a political victory, with or without diplomatic
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>E. It is not a fair criticism of the Vietnamese to say that they cannot
                            defeat the Viet Cong politically because they are tired and weak and
                            this implication is a major fallacy in Lippmann's recent article, “The
                            Stalemate in Vietnam.”<note n="4" xml:id="d166fn4">
                                <hi rend="italic">The Washington Post</hi>, September 30,
                                1965.</note> The truth is they have not had the chance to do so.
                            When the chance to win over the people was missed some years ago, a <pb n="450" xml:id="pg_450" facs="0482"/>situation came into being in
                            which it was indispensable for the Viet Cong large units to be defeated
                            before true community building, with its mixture of political and
                            security measures, would be possible. Otherwise, the Viet Cong
                            battalions, emerging from untouchable sanctuaries, would destroy
                            whatever community building had painstakingly been achieved.</p>
                        <p>F. Now it looks as though we can surely overcome the Viet Cong main force
                            units. Furthermore, it looks as though the Viet Cong knows this and has
                            already begun to act on this knowledge, transforming themselves into
                            small units, into individual terrorists, and into subversive political
                            operators. General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>
                            reports an intensification of Viet Cong “incidents” from 605 to 701 in
                            the last week, including a sharp rise in acts of terrorism. This is the
                            highest weekly total since September 1964. There is also a downward
                            total in actions by large units. In fact, no major battles occurred
                            during the week. This transformation to terrorism is emphatically not
                            “de-escalation” as one American “expert” recently said. But it is a
                            change, and a change which we have been anticipating.</p>
                        <p>G. It cannot be said that since we began defeating main force units the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> have let the grass grow under
                            their feet. When the Minister of Rural Construction (i.e. community
                            building), Mr. Ung, was killed in a plane crash, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> developed a new governmental
                            organization which I discussed in my 1190 to you of 6 Oct,<note n="5" xml:id="d166fn5">Not printed. (Department of State, Central Files,
                                    <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27 VIET <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</note> and which is as well thought
                            out as one can expect. <persName corresp="#p_LEG1">Lansdale</persName>'s
                            committee is in close and constant touch. This week they called a
                            meeting, which I attended, of all province chiefs plus elected
                            provincial councillors to enthuse them and give them a clear idea of
                            what they had to do. Vietnam is indeed much further ahead militarily
                            than it is politically for the simple reason they could not really get
                            going politically until the Viet Cong battalions were put out of
                            business.</p>
                        <p>H. I believe the U.S. Mission is doing everything that it can to help
                            prepare this country for a political struggle. But I am eager for new
                            ideas and would very much appreciate any ideas or guidance which
                            Washington can give me so that if a major political offensive were to be
                            undertaken by the Viet Cong, we could gain time until we could score a
                            real political victory. When we win such a victory, we can feel that we
                            have accomplished something durable and truly worthy of our
                            sacrifice.</p>
                        <p>2. Coup rumors</p>
                        <p>A. It is disagreeable to have to report a few coup rumors, the first
                            which have occurred since my arrival. Although they do not look serious
                            today, they are a preoccupation to me, and I am putting out the word in
                            every way available that we do not want a coup, that this is the time to
                                <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0483"/>subordinate petty
                            individualistic jealousies and ambitions, and also, that it behooves
                            those who are in government to try to act like real political leaders,
                            by reasoning with the people who are disaffected, by involving them in
                            the new projects, and by arranging matters so that others get some of
                            the credit. This is not normal procedure for Orientals, particularly
                            those who have had a long dose of the egoism of French politicos, but we
                            are trying it.</p>
                        <p>B. I am also planning to visit the III Corps headquarters which I have
                            not yet visited, to have some frank and, I hope, helpful talks with
                            Generals who, although theoretically military, are actually the heads of
                            civil and political activity and a serious potential threat.</p>
                        <p>3. Economic</p>
                        <p>A. The general price trend for the grade of rice used by the working
                            classes continued slow increase as for more than a month. The end of
                            November stock levels are expected to be low but not dangerously so, as
                            a result of delayed <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 arrivals. The
                            early rice crop from the Delta area has begun moving into the milling
                            centers. <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>'s index of food prices
                            last week rose by 4 percent to a level 6 percent higher than a month ago
                            and 34 percent higher than a year ago. Non-food consumer prices went up
                            3 percent to a level 6 percent over last and 18 percent over last year.
                            The Vietnamese piaster continued to weaken in terms of hard currencies
                            and gold.</p>
                        <p>4. Psychological</p>
                        <p>A. Vietnamese popular attitudes during the week reflected continuing
                            feeling that the war was going badly for the Viet Cong and increasing
                            concern over economic matters.</p>

                                Embassy suggested that the Viet Cong executions of American
                                prisoners were an effort to spare or save the lives of Viet Cong
                                agents and terrorists convicted and sentenced to death by South
                                Vietnam. The Embassy outlined three possible courses of action: 1)
                                tacit submission, by convincing South Vietnam to declare a de facto
                                moratorium on executions of Viet Cong agents and terrorists; 2)
                                taking indirect action against Viet Cong reprisal executions by
                                mobilizing world opinion against them; and 3) retaliation at a level
                                of violence calculated to induce the Viet Cong to become reluctant
                                to employ executions. The Embassy favored the third option.

                        <p>1. Greatly appreciate your most thoughtful message on <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> reprisal executions of American prisoners
                            and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> threats to treat their US
                            prisoners as war criminals. We agree that we can neither submit tacitly
                            to these actions or threatened actions, nor can we ignore them. However,
                            problem is to find ways and means of bringing effective pressure against
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to move them to treat prisoners in accordance with 1949
                            Geneva Convention. At same time, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            must be free to go on treating <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            terrorists in accordance with Vietnamese law (but ensuring that
                            punishment is commensurate with crime) and we must continue to do
                            everything possible to reaffirm and emphasize to world clear distinction
                            between such terrorists and prisoners of war.</p>

                            active consideration here. In meantime, hope shortly to get cable to you

                        <p>The Secretary said there is no lack of means for communicating with
                            Hanoi, Peiping or Moscow, but we have no evidence yet that they are
                            prepared to talk. We have the impression that Hanoi might be willing to
                            talk, and that Moscow would like to see talks take place, but that
                            Peiping is the real obstacle. Nevertheless, there has been some
                            progress. Hanoi no longer denies the existence of infiltration into
                            South Vietnam from the North, and they no longer insist upon a complete
                            withdrawal of US forces as a precondition for discussions. They still
                            insist, however, that any settlement must be on terms imposed by the
                                <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>—a condition which the US can
                            never accept.</p>
                        <p>The Rumanians, according to Manescu, have some contacts with Hanoi. Since
                            Hanoi is no longer insisting on withdrawal of American forces from South
                            Vietnam as a prerequisite to negotiations, it is unfortunate that the
                            United States apparently cannot consider the cessation of bombings.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we very definitely can think of stopping the bombing.
                            The Government has promised its own people—and this should be
                            convincing—that American troops will be withdrawn as soon <pb n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0486"/>as North Vietnam ceases its attempt to
                            impose its system on the people of South Vietnam by force. But Hanoi
                            still insists on acceptance of the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>
                            program as a prerequisite to negotiations. We cannot accept the
                            imposition of the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> on South
                            Vietnam—whether by Hanoi, a combination of Hanoi and Peiping, or of
                            Hanoi and Moscow. The Secretary said he was prepared to go to Geneva
                            tomorrow if Hanoi would agree to negotiate without preconditions. There
                            is hope that we may see moves toward peace in Vietnam early next year.
                            It appears that there are divided counsels in Hanoi. The Foreign
                            Minister said he hoped the Secretary was not being too optimistic. The
                            US may be taking external signs as indications of division in Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>The US has sufficient contact with Hanoi and with Peiping, according to
                            the Secretary. Apart from our own regular contacts, there are many
                            people who are constantly offering their services. At critical moments,
                            however, when there seems to be possibility for agreement, Peiping moves
                            to get in the way of a settlement. Mr. Manescu asked whether the four
                            points made by <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> are unacceptable. The
                            Secretary replied that three of the four points are negotiable. One is
                            entirely unacceptable—imposing the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>
                            program on the people of South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that one of his colleagues had suggested that,
                            in view of Rumania's relations with Hanoi, it should try to do
                            something. Mr. Manescu had replied that in his view a solution could be
                            reached only by direct talks and that Rumania could not act as a
                            mediator.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we have our own contacts with Hanoi and he was
                            not asking Mr. Manescu to act as a mediator. One could never tell,
                            however, what channel, direct or indirect, might be used. If Rumania
                            should pick up a signal he would only ask Mr. Manescu to make sure that
                            the signal was not blocked. The Foreign Minister replied that he would
                            inform his Government of this request.</p>
                        <p>Rumania wants its relations with the US to be better than “normal”. The
                            present situation in Southeast Asia could create very great problems.
                            The Foreign Minister said that so far as Vietnam is concerned, he would
                            be saying too little if he said only that we were in disagreement.
                            Rumania cannot understand the US position. The dangers of escalation are
                            always high and the ladder of escalation is one which is very difficult
                            to descend. In the Rumanian view a military solution is impossible; the
                            problem of Vietnam can be solved only by the Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that we had suffered a great disappointment in
                            Southeast Asia. President Kennedy had come into office and taken a new
                            look at Laos and concluded that if the Laotians were left alone they
                            would not be interested in killing each other. Both the President and
                            Khrushchev had agreed at Vienna that everyone should leave the Laotians
                            to themselves. Thus the Geneva Conference of 1962. We had <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455" facs="0487"/>withdrawn our military, but Hanoi had
                            never accepted the agreement, and had never had less than 6,000 troops
                            in Laos. Nor has <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> stopped using Laos
                            as an infiltration route into South Vietnam. We do not hold Moscow
                            guilty of bad faith, but it is a disappointment to us, since we had
                            hoped it would be the first step to peace in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister asked, “How do you think that the US will emerge
                            from this mixed-up and venturous program in Southeast Asia?”</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he did not know. The choice is between peace,
                            which is possible if North Vietnam leaves South Vietnam alone, or war.
                            This is the agonizing problem. The US would not object if South Vietnam
                            should decide by free and peaceful means to join with North Vietnam. We
                            cannot permit North Vietnam to impose this unity by force, however. We
                            will remain only so long as Hanoi persists in seeking to impose its
                            solution by force. If North Vietnam continues to use force for 20 years,
                            we also will be there for 20 years. If North Vietnam thinks it can wait
                            until the US loses interest and withdraws its forces, it is wrong.
                            Moscow understands that we cannot accept a forceful change in the status
                            quo, just as Moscow itself would not accept a change in the status quo
                            by force. But Hanoi does not understand this.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister suggested that perhaps the US should look at the
                            opinions of other countries, to which the Secretary replied that we had
                            done so and are doing so. The 17 unaligned nations have urged
                            negotiations without conditions; we have agreed, but Hanoi has said no.
                            The British Commonwealth had tried to send a group to Peiping, but China
                            had responded by calling the British Prime Minister a nit-wit. Hanoi had
                            sent a delegation to Moscow, but Peiping had moved to block all
                            possibility of agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister remarked that Cambodia had put forward a sound
                            proposal some years ago, but the US had rejected it. The Secretary
                            pointed out that we had thought that before there was a general
                            conference there should first be bilateral discussions between Cambodia
                            and Thailand, and Cambodia and South Vietnam. We had used our influence
                            to that end, but Prince Sihanouk had been unwilling to discuss any
                            problems with his neighbors. At any rate, that was three years ago. The
                            Laotian settlement of 1962 had been a critical moment in the move toward
                            peace, but Hanoi had rejected it.</p>
                        <p>In response to a remark that in the long run everyone might say that the
                            Chinese were right, the Secretary said that China is being rejected by
                            one country after another—even Indonesia. The Chinese doctrine of
                            military conquest has not been accepted either by the Socialist world or
                            by the Free World. China is headed either to a basic change of policy or
                            to catastrophe. Fortunately many of the Chinese leaders are practical
                            men who are more prudent in actions than in words. The US is not looking
                            for a pretext to attack China. After all, Chinese nuclear capability
                            within the <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0488"/>foreseeable future
                            will always be trivial as compared to that of the US. We are not seeking
                            an opportunity for a preventive strike—all that we want is that smaller
                            nations within the range of China be allowed to live in peace. The
                            Rumanians have a stake in this—it is important to establish that the
                            presence of a great power does not mean that small powers in the area
                            must lose their independence or security. We cannot forget that Hitler
                            moved into the Rhineland and into the Sudetenland without opposition, as
                            Japan moved into Manchuria. These developments led to World War II, for
                            which we were partly responsible. We are not going to make the same
                            mistake again. There is one important element which might bring the
                            opposing parties together in Southeast Asia. Peiping and Hanoi continue
                            to talk of the 1954 agreement, as do we. Both parties have also referred
                            to the 1962 Laos agreement. There is some reason to think that these
                            agreements can be the basis for peace in Southeast Asia. If there are
                            disputes, let them be solved by peaceful means. This is basically the
                            position of Moscow, although it cannot fail to support North Vietnam
                            because of its own dispute with Peiping.</p>

                        <p>On October 18, 1965, at 10:26 a.m., McGeorge Bundy telephoned Secretary
                            Rusk to inform him that Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> would like to arrange for

                        <p>1356. For Secretary from Ambassador. Your 1058.<note n="2" xml:id="d170fn2">In telegram 1058, October 19, Rusk asked <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> to send him privately his
                                reaction to three questions concerning the proposed second phase
                                deployment of U.S. troops to Vietnam. The answers provided by
                                    <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> would aid in the
                                consideration of the issue in Washington. The first question
                                concerned the need for such substantially increased deployment, the
                                second related to the problems such deployment might create in
                                Vietnam, and the third question dealt with the best timing and
                                phasing for such deployment if the U.S. Government decided to
                                undertake it. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>A. I believe that substantially increased deployment such as is
                            envisioned in Phase 2 would have a good political effect because it
                            would enable us effectively to destroy or neutralize the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> main force units and destroy their
                            present redoubts more quickly than is now the case. This would surely
                            help the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in getting an effective
                            community building pacification program going.</p>
                        <p>B. Clearly an increase in U.S. personnel has possibilities for friction,
                            but I think a long, drawn out American military presence creates more
                            friction in the end than a shorter presence with the people.</p>
                        <p>C. The contemplated timing is satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>D. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> believes and I concur that the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> is working hard to restore the old
                            balance which our U.S. presence has upset. In other words, we have
                            achieved some momentum and should not only maintain, but increase it if
                            we can.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> The President, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and yourself can take pride
                            in both the diversified scope and thoroughness of the present American
                            effort here, which I believe is quite unprecedented. The extent to which
                            all Americans are pulling together is noteworthy. I feel that some very
                            big things are being created of which Phase 2 is an important part. But
                            if for any reason you cannot undertake Phase 2, I believe we can still
                            do big things with what we have, although it will take longer. If a
                            feeling should catch hold among the people that they have a real stake
                            in this government, things could go very fast indeed. Of this, however,
                            there is as yet no dependable sign.</p>

                                before. I have talked at some length with both Joe Alsop and Warren

                            the telegram. (Johnson Library, National Security File, Memos to the
                            President, McGeorge Bundy, Vol. XV)</p>
                        <p>1355. For the President. Herewith my weekly telegram. Hope you are
                            feeling better.</p>
                        <p>1. Current political.</p>
                        <p>The most striking political news of the week was the complete failure of
                            the Viet Cong's call for a general strike in Saigon on October 15 to
                            inaugurate a “hate America” month. In Saigon and throughout the
                            countryside the population paid not the slightest attention to the
                            strike call.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> went on the air
                            with the first in a series of five planned fireside chats. He talked
                            about the rising cost of living for which he blamed hoarders,
                            speculators and the Viet Cong. He explained that the displacement of a
                            number of families in Saigon was due to the construction of a projected
                            new bridge which would increase access to the port of Saigon and thereby
                            increase the port's cargo handling capacity. He promised that death
                            benefits to families of deceased servicemen would be paid within a month
                            or that full explanations would be required.</p>
                        <p>A conference of province chiefs and members of provincial assemblies was
                            held to improve communication between the national and provincial levels
                            of government. The conference came up with a number of recommendations
                            concerning training, standardization of salaries, and tenure for
                            province chiefs. Some older politicians among the provincial
                            representatives took the occasion to circulate a petition calling on the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to form an interim assembly from
                            the provincial councils and to prepare for National Assembly elections.
                            This initiative aroused very little public attention.</p>
                        <p>2. Basic political.</p>
                        <p>The more I study and learn, the more impressed I am with the savage and
                            thorough way in which the Viet Cong has destroyed the political <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0491"/>structure of this country.
                            Everything that I have read about successful counter-guerrilla activity
                            says that one must start in each hamlet by picking out a good man to be
                            chairman of a committee of up and coming young men. In this country the
                            “good man” all too often has had his head cut off, the grade B people
                            have been driven out and what is left are the old and the weak and the
                            children—not a real community at all.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, therefore, faces the need of
                            actually bringing in the proposed local leadership. I thought the war
                            veterans would be a likely nucleus but I now learn that 80 percent of
                            the war veterans are afraid to live out in the country and have gathered
                            in the cities. We are, therefore, not just starting from scratch but
                            starting well below scratch.</p>
                        <p>The plan to form cadres of about 200 carefully selected people with above
                            average gumption and recruited as much as possible among men who used
                            once to live in the village which it is planned to pacify seems
                            sensible.</p>
                        <p>The political action teams which the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            has formed can be the nucleus and should be a big help.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LEG1">Lansdale</persName> is working on this—and
                            on the psychological and emotional side to try to make people want a new
                            life and stir them up a little bit with songs.</p>
                        <p>He and I think rural electrification has a great potential as something
                            that can be done quickly—action rather than words—and which has a
                            wonderful psychological effect.</p>
                        <p>As the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> picks its first group of 200
                            and pacifies—or rather rebuilds—its first community, it will, of course,
                            have the <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> resources in back of
                            it.</p>
                        <p>I believe a few genuine successes can have a profound psychological
                            effect. We saw how radically psychology can change for the better
                            following your decision to send U.S. troops. I have just learned of 1400
                            refugees in Binh Dinh Province to whom Americans have given such
                            confidence that they actually went back home. A similar change as
                            regards community building is not inconceivable. The Viet Cong clearly
                            do not expect it. But neither did they expect the capacity to destroy
                            main force units which we have demonstrated.</p>
                        <p>Whatever we do must be durable. Dependable, local security forces must
                            remain. The new village leaders must be protected from assassination. It
                            is better to do nothing rather than simply recreate another pattern of
                            terrorism and assassination.</p>
                        <p>3. Security.</p>
                        <p>The total number of Viet Cong incidents increased for the fourth
                            successive week reflecting largely increased acts of terrorism and
                            increased anti-aircraft fire. The total number of actual Viet Cong
                            attacks decreased considerably. Big U.S. sweeps in two provinces failed
                            to trap <pb n="460" xml:id="pg_460" facs="0492"/>Viet Cong units but did
                            keep the Viet Cong on the move, thus weakening their ability to mount
                            attacks.</p>
                        <p>4. Economics.</p>
                        <p>Saigon retail rice prices dropped slightly during the week, reversing a
                            slow upward trend that had continued for over a month. The prices
                            dropped despite a decrease in rice stocks on hand. This reflected
                            confident expectations that <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480
                            shipments will bring in sufficient rice to meet demands. However concern
                            continued over the increased cost of living in general and the
                            Vietnamese piaster continued to weaken in terms of hard currencies and
                            gold.</p>
                        <p>The government took a number of measures against the increased cost of
                            living. It rationed sweetened condensed milk. It withheld new price
                            schedules, reflecting tariff increases, pending the liquidation of old
                            stocks. It arrested and fined merchants who sold old stocks at new
                            prices.</p>
                        <p>5. Psychological.</p>
                        <p>The failure of the Viet Cong's call for a “day of revenge” to include a
                            general strike and an “hour of silence” on October 15 demonstrated that
                            the Viet Cong enjoy very little real support from the people. The
                            failure of this effort represented a psychological defeat for the Viet
                            Cong and this fact has not been lost on either the Vietnamese people or
                            on foreign correspondents, particularly Asians, who were watching
                            developments closely.</p>
                        <p>The high cost of living continued to dominate much Vietnamese thinking
                            throughout the country.</p>

                        <p>1361. 1. Henry Kissinger <note n="2" xml:id="d172fn2"> Henry Kissinger
                                recalls that <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> asked him
                                to visit South Vietnam as a consultant. He toured the country for 2
                                weeks in late October and early November talking with civilian and
                                military leaders. See <hi rend="italic">White House Years</hi>, pp.
                                231-233. Records of 12 of Kissinger's “more important” conversations
                                were transmitted in airgram A-285 from Saigon, November 4.
                                (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27 VIET <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</note> and
                            I had lunch with PriMin <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> at Nha
                            Trang Oct 19. <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> has been in Nha
                            Trang recuperating from a bad cold. In <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461" facs="0493"/>relaxed environment <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> discussed problems of a negotiated settlement and his
                            internal political difficulties with considerable candor.</p>
                        <p>2. When the subject of negotiations came up, <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> stated emphatically that Vietnam was in no position
                            at the present time to negotiate a settlement with Hanoi. He said there
                            were two basic reasons for this: (A) Fragility of internal situation and
                            the continuing presence of political divisions, especially on the
                            civilian side. The political fabric of Vietnam is weakened to the extent
                            that it could not yet compete with the Viet Cong in many parts of the
                            countryside—not because <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are popular,
                            but because of their ruthless organization. (B) The announcement of the
                            acceptance of negotiations could weaken the morale and will to resist
                            Communism to a dangerous extent—even to the point where the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> could lose its will to fight with
                            “many soldiers giving up and going home.” <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> said also that he did not think a cease-fire at the
                            present time would do anything but provide a means by which the Viet
                            Cong would further consolidate their hold over those areas of the
                            country which they now controlled. This would in effect perpetuate the
                            partition of South Vietnam into pro-Viet Cong and anti-Communist
                            areas.</p>
                        <p>3. He said that he believed that Hanoi had made a great error from its
                            viewpoint in not accepting the offer to negotiate several months ago
                            when South Vietnam was in even worse shape politically. Things were a
                            little better now. Nevertheless, much had to be done in reorganizing
                            South Vietnam before the govt would be in a position to deal with the
                            Viet Cong politically on the ground. Viet Cong cadres remained well
                            disciplined and the re-orientation and re-dedication of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> cadres was yet to be accomplished.
                                <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> said that the military
                            strength of South Vietnam, supported by its allies, had now reached the
                            stage where pacification and strengthening of the govt's position could
                            proceed so that hopefully in about one year's time things would be much
                            better.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> said that the most important
                            political requirement for the immediate future was the maintenance of
                            unity among the various Generals in the armed forces. He said that the
                            only element able to provide necessary leadership in South Vietnam was
                            the armed forces. Civilian political groups had demonstrated their
                            inability to work together and the age-old problems of regionalism and
                            religious differences were such that any govt built around one group
                            would automatically draw to itself such internal political opposition
                            from others that it could not survive. In the circumstances the armed
                            forces must seek to rise above sectional and religious differences. They
                            were capable of doing so because its various people for years had been
                            used to working together regardless of traditional factional
                            factors.</p>
                        <p>5. He then described a recent conversation with General <persName corresp="#p_Co1">Co</persName>, Deputy PriMin, and other military
                            leaders in which he had impressed upon them the importance of
                            maintaining their unity. This plea, he said, <pb n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0494"/>had been occasioned by the interjection of regional and
                            religious differences over the appointment of certain key officers in
                            the last governmental changes. He claimed that as a result of
                            conversations among the Generals, unity had been reaffirmed and the
                            situation was quieter.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> said that he recognized the
                            importance of enlisting the support of various non-military elements in
                            the work of the govt. He was hopeful that the recent conferences of
                            province chiefs and provincial council reps was a first step in securing
                            a wider participation of all key elements in the community. He intended
                            that such confs would now take place at the regional level to be
                            followed later by another national conf. In this way people would get to
                            know each other and used to working with each other. It would give him
                            the chance to weed out any Communist sympathizers. A national advisory
                            council drawn from the provincial councils and leading sects and groups
                            to serve as a consultative group for the govt would be created. He would
                            see how the first steps now being taken work before formalizing any such
                            arrangements. Its work should be limited to matters which did not
                            embarrass the govt in the conduct of foreign relations or which did not
                            endanger the security of the state.</p>
                        <p>7. Finally, <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> said that he was
                            placing great emphasis on the new pacification and rural construction
                            effort which was getting underway under the leadership of General
                                <persName corresp="#p_Co1">Co</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_Thang1">Thang</persName>. Cadre reorganization and
                            training would soon begin and he wanted to get the program in action in
                            primary areas: Danang-Quang Nam, Binh Dinh, and the Saigon-Cholon-Gia
                            Dinh area. He asked for full support from the U.S. for these efforts,
                            which I assured him was going to be forthcoming. He said that over the
                            next year he expected that these efforts would yield great results and
                            he expressed confidence in the ability of the govt to re-organize itself
                            to meet the needs of the fundamental political and social economic
                            struggle in the countryside.</p>
                        <p>8. When I was alone with Gen <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>
                            after lunch, I brought up our concern over the leakage of info to the
                            Viet Cong about military operations. We knew that it worried him as much
                            as it did us. He agreed and said that this was due largely to the
                            frequent changes which had taken place in the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and in the military structure. Whenever there were
                            changes, it gave the Communists the chance to work in. He assured me of
                            his best efforts.</p>
                        <p>9. I took occasion to express the hope that whenever sentence is passed
                            on prisoners that it be publicly made very clear that the punishment was
                            commensurate with the offense. His treatment of prisoners concerned us
                            very intimately because of the fate of our own prisoners. He said he
                            understood and agreed to cooperate.</p>
                        <p>10. Coming back to the problem of inflation, I stressed the points which
                            had been put to him by Mann at a previous meeting and went on to make a
                            few suggestions as follows: he should particularly watch the <pb n="463" xml:id="pg_463" facs="0495"/>prices of the important staples which
                            the people eat, such as rice, nuoc mam, milk, pork, etc. <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> said that he was having this done. I
                            said that it was not too difficult to watch these and that he was in a
                            position to act affirmatively, and that action was better than words or
                            a futile attempt to set up a big administrative structure.</p>
                        <p>11. I cited reports of Viet Cong in <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            uniforms diverting truckloads of rice. I pointed out that the police
                            were not allowed to arrest anybody in uniform and that therefore the
                            Vietnamese military should establish checkpoints to stop these trucks
                            and verify the presence of Viet Cong in army uniform.</p>
                        <p>12. I especially suggested establishing a few emergency sales outlets in
                            Saigon for children and the needy where the scarce staples could be sold
                            at govt price. This was something simple and it too was action rather
                            than words. Yet it would create favorable sentiment for the govt. He
                            could later consider the question of giving some food away.</p>
                        <p>13. I referred to the congestion in the port of Saigon. He had obviously
                            thought about this a great deal and felt it was not due to trouble with
                            labor unions, but to a very real labor shortage.</p>
                        <p>14. He referred specifically to a pier owned by the Messageries
                            Maritimes, a French steamship line under control of the French Govt.
                            This pier was not in use and yet the steamship line refused to make it
                            available. General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> told me
                            finally he had decided to requisition the pier.</p>
                        <p>15. Comment: This refusal to make an unused pier available to the
                            Vietnamese or to the American military is widely believed to be a direct
                            manifestation of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                            anti-American policy. How this helps the French colony in Vietnam, or
                            how it helps the rank and file French people in France, or how it can be
                            considered the reaction of an ally are questions the answers to which do
                            not exist here.</p>
                        <p>16. Every time I see General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>, I
                            am impressed with the way in which he has grown, in knowledge of this
                            job, in judgment and in general stature. If fate enables him to stay on
                            the job for a reasonable period of time, he could become a first class
                            political leader in the best sense of the term. If there are govts in
                            this world which have a man of much better quality and potential than
                            General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>, then I do not know
                            what they are.</p>
                        <p>17. When, therefore, I read Dar-es-Salaam's no. 11<note n="3" xml:id="d172fn3">In this telegram, October 18, sent to the
                                Department of State as telegram 757 and repeated to Saigon,
                                Ambassador William Leonhart reported a conversation on Vietnam with
                                Tanganyikan President Julius Nyerere. (Ibid.)</note> in which
                            Nyerere speaks seriously of “establishing a broader based regime,” I am
                            astounded. I presume the phrase “broader based regime” means putting in
                            the Communists which, of course, means taking out General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>. I can understand why a Communist
                            would suggest this, but I cannot understand why anyone should consider
                            it other than a crass attempt at gaining <pb n="464" xml:id="pg_464" facs="0496"/>by political intrigue what they have not been able to
                            obtain in other ways.</p>

                        <p>1360. Dept repeat as desired. Ref: Depcirtel 630.<note n="2" xml:id="d173fn2">In circular telegram 630, October 20, the
                                Department suggested that, in light of the increasing number of U.S.
                                personnel in North Vietnamese hands, the question of appointing a
                                protecting power capable of assuming the rights and responsibilities
                                under the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War of 1949 should be
                                urgently explored. (Ibid.)</note>

                        <p>1. Following are Mission comments on idea of protecting power for US
                            prisoners in <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> under Geneva
                            Conventions of 1949.</p>
                        <p>2. As Dept is aware we have long been dubious of significant practical
                            benefits which can reasonably be expected in terms of improved treatment
                            for US prisoners from any of series of legal or propaganda gambits which
                            have been suggested or attempted recently. Dept has under consideration
                            our recommendations for more belligerent measures to improve prisoners'
                                lot.<note n="3" xml:id="d173fn3">See <ref target="#d167fn2">footnote
                                    2, Document 167</ref>.</note> We continue to believe that
                            self-interest is only motive governing Hanoi treatment of our prisoners
                            and that normal compunctions of relatively civilized govts do not apply,
                            nor does decent respect for opinion of mankind. It is possible, however,
                            that Hanoi regime does value favorable attitudes of some segments of
                            foreign opinion sufficiently to take their sensitivities into account in
                            weighing best use to make of prisoners. We have in mind here especially
                            Japanese and some other Asian opinion. Thus, for instance, if Hanoi were
                            convinced that Japanese left-wingers would be more upset by execution of
                            U.S. prisoners following sham war-crimes trials than by horrors suffered
                            by <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> civil populace they would be
                            accused during such trials of having caused, then <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> might take this factor into account,
                            along with others, in deciding whether to execute prisoners or not.
                            Thus, our legal and moral leverage through the exercise of public
                            opinion is extremely limited, though there are some points at which we
                            can bring it to bear.</p>
                        <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465" facs="0497"/>
                        <p>3. The above considerations are relevant to subject at hand for two
                            reasons: we should not expect too much from this proposal, and we should
                            recognize that proposal is essentially an attempt to marshal
                            international public opinion to protect welfare of our prisoners.</p>
                        <p>4. We think it likely that if request for acceptance of protecting power
                            is advanced by U.S., Hanoi will reject request and will also reject
                            request for assumption by <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> of role
                            of protecting power. Hanoi has refused to respond substantively to
                                <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> question about whether it is
                            willing to apply Geneva Conventions to present conflict, and it
                            therefore presumably regards itself as not bound by their provisions.
                            Admittedly, its position is equivocal and inconsistent, since it has
                            cited one of its reservations to Geneva Conventions in laying groundwork
                            for possible trial of U.S. prisoners as war criminals, and has accused
                            U.S. of violating Conventions in our bombings. Nevertheless, we strongly
                            believe that Hanoi regime does not want a third country acting in
                            interests of U.S. nor an international body such as ICRC traveling about
                                <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> visiting prisoners, etc., as
                            required by Conventions. Furthermore, we do not believe Hanoi will want
                            to set any embarrassing precedents for their Front stooges and the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in accepting applicability of
                            Geneva Conventions.</p>
                        <p>5. Having said the above, we agree with Dept. that there may be some
                            advantages in propaganda field to be gained from proposal. We should
                            bear in mind our propaganda objectives in making our request and in
                            subsequent steps. First three specific advantages cited in para 3 of
                            reftel presuppose Hanoi's agreeing to protecting power or <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>, so fourth advantage is one we should
                            be prepared to hammer home.<note n="4" xml:id="d173fn4">In this
                                paragraph of circular telegram 630, the Department enumerated three
                                advantages of applying the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War.
                                The first was its provisions requiring due process of judicial
                                proceedings (and exposing reprisals masquerading as war crime
                                punishment); the second was 35 specific articles in the convention
                                defining the role of the protecting power vis-a-vis POWs; and the
                                third was the fact that the protecting power's role supplemented and
                                complemented the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>. A fourth
                                advantage would be a propaganda one accruing from the refusal of
                                North Vietnam to accept a protecting power and casting itself in a
                                bad light in world opinion. (Department of State, Central Files,
                                    <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27-7 VIET)</note> One other
                            advantage of course would be that <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>
                            would be given another project to work on besides alleged U.S. and
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> shortcomings in application
                            Geneva Conventions and it would set record a little straighter on which
                            side trying to act humanely in this conflict. Another advantage would be
                            improvement in our posture with U.S. public and Congress to show that we
                            are doing everything possible, regardless of seeming futility, to try to
                            improve welfare and safety of U.S. prisoners. For same reason it would
                            have a helpful effect on morale of U.S. pilots engaged in NVN
                            missions.</p>
                        <p>6. We likewise do not see serious disadvantages in proposal, since it is
                            even more unlikely <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> would request
                            protecting power in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, as <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0498"/>they do not admit having forces in
                            conflict or legitimacy of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Such an
                            eventuality might be embarrassing for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and ourselves until handling of prisoners has improved
                            (it is continuing to get better daily and most problems are of
                            administrative nature) and would presumably also afford fine propaganda
                            opportunities for Communists. Should Front call for a protecting power
                            (which we also think unlikely), we might be faced with public opinion
                            problem ourselves in refusing to permit one. This would however open way
                            for us to demand protecting power (perhaps same one as in <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>) for prisoners held by <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>7. With reference to last sentence para 5 <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>,<note n="5" xml:id="d173fn5">In paragraph 5, the
                                Department noted that since the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>
                                was not recognized and North Vietnam denied its forces were in South
                                Vietnam, there was no question of their requesting a protecting
                                power for their prisoners. However this did not mean that prisoners
                                held by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> should not have a
                                protecting power appointed. As the last sentence in paragraph 5
                                indicated: “Second paragraph Article 10 GPW [Geneva Prisoner of War
                                treaty] requires Detaining Power (<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>) to appoint neutral state or impartial organization
                                to fufill this function, if Hanoi fails to take action in this
                                regard.”(Ibid.)</note> we note <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            and other Communist states expressed reservation limiting application
                            second paragraph Article 10, and wonder whether <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> also did so when it adhered to Conventions (our files
                            are incomplete).</p>
                        <p>8. Subsequent paragraphs are concerned with which protecting power we
                            should choose. As Dept aware <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> assumed
                            protection of U.S. interests and custody of U.S. property when we closed
                            Hanoi Consulate in December, 1955 and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            continues to function in that capacity. Why would continuance that role
                            on behalf U.S. prisoners raise recognition issue more than it already
                            has been? Since <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> is already our
                            “protecting power,” in one sense, perhaps British could simply notify
                            Hanoi they had been asked expand that role to cover U.S. prisoners and
                            see when Hanoi responds.</p>
                        <p>9. We have expended great efforts to persuade Morocco and Senegal not to
                            send reps to Hanoi. Is it worthwhile suggesting they do so now,
                            especially since we doubt DRV would let them subsequently adopt
                            protective power role? Rabat and Dakar of course have better feel for
                            effects of our switch in position on local attitudes.</p>
                        <p>10. Could <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> be asked to take over this
                            role? Article 10 seems to refer to such possibilities. Even if such were
                            possible, however, we doubt wisdom of involving ICC in this question and
                            do not think they would wish to enter into it. Nevertheless, there may
                            be advantages to such idea which we here do not know about.</p>
                        <p>11. Bearing in mind propaganda aspects of this proposal, what would be
                            pros and cons of requesting Czechs or Rumanians to be our protecting
                            power, after Hanoi had rejected other choices? Do Eastern European
                            regimes feel themselves now under sufficiently greater moral restraint
                            to warrant our choosing a relatively unfriendly and Communist <pb n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0499"/>state to look after our
                            prisoners? Hanoi would surely find it harder to refuse bloc country as
                            protecting power, and if they did, propaganda gains for U.S. would be
                            even greater. If contrary to expectations, Hanoi accepted them, bloc
                            protecting power presumably would be better than none.</p>
                        <p>12. We doubt very much that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would
                            request a protecting power for their own troops held by <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> (so far as we know none are held by
                                <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>) since problems of recognition
                            would be raised.</p>
                        <p>13. Finally we wish to note that none of above affects prisoners held by
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. They are the ones who suffer
                            greatest hardships and the three prisoners who have been executed in
                            reprisals were murdered by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>Potentially more serious is the difference between <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>'s public and private
                            statements at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> (which are
                            presumably made on instructions from Washington) and <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>'s not-so-private views. We may
                            be confronted with the Hawk-Dove syndrome in the press and, more
                            importantly, with the erosion of the government's credibility. The <pb n="468" xml:id="pg_468" facs="0500"/>fact of the matter is that if
                            Hanoi gives a clear “signal” that it is ready to talk we will be placed
                            in a very awkward position if we don't respond in the light of the
                            President's statement (most recently re-asserted in a speech by
                                <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Cy Vance</persName>)<note n="4" xml:id="d174fn4">Not found.</note> that we will go “anywhere anytime

                        <p>I was told yesterday by <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Joe Sisco</persName>
                            that <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> is very concerned
                            about this—as well he might be.</p>
                        <p>You may recall that before <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>
                            left I suggested that the President clear up the negotiations matter
                            with him. The longer we leave this in limbo the more difficult it will
                            be to deal with when we have to. At a minimum, I suggest that <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> be instructed to keep his
                            private thoughts private and be reminded that when and if the time comes
                            when Hanoi says “Geneva here we come”, we will be going too. One of
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>'s high priority tasks
                            should be to reach the kind of understanding with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> that will permit the U.S. and the

                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>I wish to make a further suggestion concerning United States posture
                            toward unconditional negotiations on Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Contrary to our earlier expectations, the situation in Vietnam did not
                            receive overriding emphasis in the General Assembly's general debate—a
                            development due primarily to the sudden eruption of the conflict between
                            India and Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>Vietnam was, of course, the second topic most frequently touched upon in
                            the general debate. It has been encouraging to find not only that the
                            United States role in Vietnam found considerable support but also <pb n="469" xml:id="pg_469" facs="0501"/>that criticism of the American
                            role was neither so severe nor so widespread as had been anticipated.
                            Unqualified criticism of our role and full support for Hanoi was voiced
                            by only the Congo (Brazzaville), the Soviet bloc, plus Cuba, Albania and
                            Cambodia (the latter three predictably exceeded all others in
                            harshness); in addition, somewhat less hostile, but still very critical,
                            statements were made by Kenya, Guinea and Mali. On the other hand, the
                            United States position received support from some eighteen countries,
                            including—and this is worthy of particular note—most of those countries
                            in the Far East which are closest to the threat posed by Hanoi's actions
                            toward South Vietnam. The remainder of the speeches, some with implied
                            criticism of the United States and some with implied criticism of Hanoi,
                            tended to emphasize one of two themes: first, the impossibility of a
                            military solution and the urgency of beginning negotiations (often
                            combined with appeals for a cessation of all hostilities); second, the
                            advocacy of negotiations, coupled with the argument that continued
                            American bombing of North Vietnam virtually rules out negotiations.</p>
                        <p>It is clear to me that the relatively good treatment the United States
                            role in Vietnam received in the general debate is a direct product of
                            two factors: the frequent reiteration, in months past, of our
                            willingness to begin unconditional negotiations; the excellent work done
                            in Washington and in our Embassies throughout the world to explain the
                            United States goals in Vietnam. In short, the posture the United States
                            has assumed toward negotiations, besides being correct in terms of
                            substance, has proved advantageous in terms of our international
                            image.</p>
                        <p>Despite the outcome of the general debate, however, I must report that I
                            have sensed some doubt (even among some of our friends) whether we
                            really want negotiations. This doubt has, of course, been compounded by
                            certain statements made recently, as well as by reports of South
                            Vietnam's opposition to unconditional negotiations. It is generally
                            expressed not in outright questioning of United States sincerity; it
                            takes the form, rather, of a feeling that United States
                            publicly-expressed interest in negotiations may stem less from a desire
                            to begin negotiations immediately than from a desire to maintain a
                            positive international image while improving our military posture for
                            negotiations in the future.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>'s speech of
                            October 19<note n="2" xml:id="d175fn2">See <ref target="#d174fn3">footnote 3, Document 174</ref>.</note> was, of course,
                            immensely helpful in countering this undercurrent of doubt. It would be
                            even more helpful, in my view, if there were to be further periodic
                            reiteration by you and the Secretary of both our continued desire for
                            prompt unconditional negotiations and of our willingness to suspend
                            bombings <pb n="470" xml:id="pg_470" facs="0502"/>provided there were
                            some assurance North Vietnam would respond with comparable measures to
                            restrain its military activities in the South. I can, of course,
                            emphasize such statements here, as I have in the past, with good effects
                            on other countries.</p>

                        <p>I. Vietnam not ready</p>
                        <p>A. This telegram is occasioned by General <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName>'s statement to me on Oct 13 that he guessed there
                            would eventually be an offer to negotiate from the Viet Cong (presumably
                            through Hanoi). To this <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName>
                            added the statement (concurred in emphatically by FonMin <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Tran Van Do</persName> and on Tuesday, Oct 19, by
                            PriMin <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>) that Vietnam is
                            absolutely unready for the serious political warfare with the Communists
                            of which such a move would be the beginning; that this offer would
                            cripple Vietnamese military activities; and that it would thus
                            jeopardize all that we and they have struggled to achieve.<note n="2" xml:id="d176fn2">See <ref target="#d166">Documents 166</ref> and
                                    <ref target="#d172">172</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>B. I concur with the remarks of these Vietnamese leaders. At present
                            South Vietnam suffers from a fragile political structure, governmental
                            authority is not strong in the countryside. The govt is so overwhelmed
                            with immediate pressures that it has not been able to prepare public
                            opinion for a negotiated settlement. Unless the way has been most
                            carefully prepared—and perhaps even then—entering into negotiations
                            could lead to a direct threat to the existence of the govt. It might not
                            lead to a coup but it would almost certainly lead to frantic jockeying
                            for position <pb n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0503"/>in Saigon and
                            encourage Viet Cong political and military pressure against the
                            stability of the govt. To minimize these dangers requires stating
                            conditions which the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> can endure. Any
                            pressure on the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to depart from what
                            they consider a satisfactory outcome could have disastrous
                            consequences.</p>
                        <p>C. Clearly Hanoi can call for a meeting at any time that it wishes. It is
                            prudent to assume that they will do so at a moment of maximum
                            disadvantage to us. In the light of what has been said we cannot refuse
                            to meet. The protection of our vital interests, therefore, depends on
                            the terms of the negotiation rather than on a refusal to meet. It also
                            means that we be clear and specific in our own minds with respect to
                            these terms. I say this as one who approves the decision of last spring
                            to express a willingness to enter into unconditional discussions, which,
                            I believe, played a big part in bringing about public support of our
                            Vietnam policy in the United States and abroad.</p>
                        <p>D. If we are going to get ready to negotiate—or to discuss—then I believe
                            it is essential that we have as a standard of measurement what
                            concretely we consider would be a satisfactory outcome of our efforts in
                            Vietnam. In other words it is time to attach specific meaning to such
                            phrases as “ward off the aggression” or “to help the Republic of Vietnam
                            achieve and then maintain its independence.” A satisfactory outcome
                            could be achieved by military, civil-political, economic, and
                            psychological means within South Vietnam or by persuasion on North
                            Vietnam, or by a combination of these various factors. We should decide
                            to remain here until it has somehow been accomplished.</p>
                        <p>E. The opinion of the U.S. Mission here on what concretely constitutes a
                            satisfactory outcome is obviously pertinent. Accordingly, this matter
                            was discussed at a meeting of the U.S. Mission Council on Tuesday, Oct
                            19. What follows is the consensus which emerged, broken down into its
                            component parts, of what seems reasonable at this juncture.</p>
                        <p>II. A satisfactory outcome in Vietnam</p>
                        <p>A. A satisfactory outcome is, to be sure, distinct from a negotiating
                            position. Off-hand, I would think that an opening negotiating position
                            might insist on a complete elimination of all Viet Cong activity in the
                            entire country, removal of the Viet Cong to North Vietnam, a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> inspection system in North Vietnam to see
                            that no further aggression is committed, freedom for anti-Communists in
                            North Vietnam to move south, and assurance of economic aid (to pull them
                            away from Peking)—all to be agreed to by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>B. What we consider a satisfactory outcome to be would, of course, be a
                            very closely kept secret. It would include the following, not
                            necessarily in this order:</p>
                        <p>1. The area around Saigon and south of Saigon (all of the Delta) must be
                            pacified. This area includes about 55 to 60 per cent of the population
                                <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0504"/>of Vietnam. “Pacified” is
                            defined as the existence of a state of mind among the people that they
                            have a stake in the govt, as shown by the holding of local elections. It
                            also means a proper local police force. In brief, a pacified area is
                            economically, socially and politically a part of the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. The thickly populated northeastern strip along the coast which
                            includes 25 per cent of the population would be completely pacified.</p>
                        <p>3. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would retain its present
                            control of all cities and all provincial capitals.</p>
                        <p>4. All principal roads would be open to the Vietnamese military day and
                            night.</p>
                        <p>5. Those areas not pacified would not be safehavens for the Viet Cong but
                            would be contested by energetic offensive forays to prevent
                            consolidation of a Communist base.</p>
                        <p>6. The Viet Cong disarms; and their weapons and explosives are removed
                            from their hands. Their main force units would be broken up.</p>
                        <p>7. North Vietnam stops its infiltration.</p>
                        <p>8. North Vietnam stops its direction of the war.</p>

                            rehabilitation would be extended to individual Viet Cong who are
                            suitable (including those who were impressed into the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> by terrorism), with plans to resettle
                            them.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> This means that we would not be
                            insisting on the complete elimination of the Viet Cong from all corners
                            of the country although no land of safehaven would be allotted to them.
                            It would mean that we and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would
                            control 80 to 85 per cent of the population and that the Viet Cong would
                            be limited to the jungle and mountainous areas where they would go on as
                            bandits, much as their counterparts do today in Malaya and in Luzon—and
                            where the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would have the right to
                            pursue them and try to destroy them.</p>
                        <p>III. Conduct of talks</p>
                        <p>A. I assume, of course, that the above will not become relevant unless
                            Hanoi itself asks for talks.</p>
                        <p>1. If this happens, I would advise that our military activity be at first
                            intensified and then continued during the talks. Without continuing
                            military pressure by us, no worthwhile results can be expected.</p>
                        <p>2. Under no circumstances should a cease-fire be agreed to, because a
                            cease-fire would legalize and make permanent the present occupation of
                            part of the country by the Viet Cong and would stultify our sacrifices.
                            Communists never give up the terrain where they are except under
                            pressure. Moreover, the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> would try to
                            expand their present influence into new areas under cover of the
                            cease-fire.</p>
                        <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473" facs="0505"/>
                        <p>3. We should place a time limit on the talks—perhaps not more than a
                            month. Failure to set such a time limit will give scope to the favorite
                            Communist tactic of delay which makes us look contemptible, impatient
                            and undignified. It also means that they will use the time which their
                            diplomats gain for them to bring about an improved military position
                            which their soldiers, unaided, had been unable to achieve.</p>
                        <p>4. Agreement on supervision of any understanding should be item one on
                            the agenda, at the beginning, when our pressure is greatest.</p>
                        <p>IV. Value of talks</p>
                        <p>A. In spite of the fact that the Communists will attempt to violate any
                            agreement which is reached if they think it is in their interest to do
                            so, negotiation with the Communists can be said to have value if, in
                            fact,</p>
                        <p>1. It ends or reduces the bloodshed, and</p>
                        <p>2. Sets down enforceable conditions which, if we are strong enough to
                            maintain them, will prevent a relapse into the aggression which brought
                            about the conflict in the first place. While we must never depend on the
                            given word of the Communists, an agreement can have value if it can be
                            inspected and enforced.</p>
                        <p>B. A prolonged negotiation, or one in which we aim to force <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> into a corner by requiring
                            him to admit his defeat by signing a paper, can drag out the conflict
                            and increase the bloodshed. A de facto end of hostilities would be
                            preferable to either of these alternatives and would also be easier for
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to accept.</p>
                        <p>C. It seems clear that we were not as ready for the end of hostilities in
                            1945 and in 1953 as we should have been. Surely we should learn from
                            these experiences and be perfectly ready for the new turn this war will
                            take if Hanoi decides to try negotiation. You have mounted an American
                            effort here which is unprecedented in the breadth of its sweep, the
                            thoroughness of its execution and in the extent to which all Americans
                            are pulling together. I am sure that our reaction to the next move—if it
                            comes—will be on the same level of excellence.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>a. To remove for an adequate time the element of continued bombing of the
                            North and thus to test the willingness of North Vietnam to reduce its
                            support of the Viet Cong and Viet Cong activities in the South, and to
                            enter into negotiations without preconditions (i.e., to abandon the
                            present conditions particularly on the “four points”). In other words, a
                            second pause is first and perhaps foremost a serious effort to see if
                            there can be real progress toward a political solution.</p>
                        <p>b. Whether or not this pause brings about such results, to underscore
                            again our willingness to work toward a solution by reciprocal
                            actions.</p>
                        <p>c. To satisfy domestic and international opinion that we have indeed
                            exhausted for the time being all possibilities of progress toward a
                            peaceful solution, as a prelude to whatever increased action might then
                            become necessary, such as Phase II deployments or further expansion in
                            the bombing of the North.</p>
                        <p>d. To halt temporarily the possibilities of a wider war. However, this
                            can only be a subsidiary objective because we must envisage that, if
                            there is no response, we will resume bombing and there may be a larger
                            chance of escalation thereafter.</p>
                        <p>e. By varying the pattern of bombing attacks on the North, to make the
                            resumption of bombing, if and when it takes place, more psychologically
                            damaging and effective.</p>
                        <p>f. To insert a proposal that may produce substantial disagreement among
                            the various Communist parties.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>a. We do not wish to upset confidence in South Vietnam or faith in our
                            continued firmness as necessary.</p>
                        <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0508"/>
                        <p>b. To avoid any misunderstanding in Hanoi that our action means we are
                            ready to compromise our objectives and are ourselves afraid we cannot or
                            will not stay the course.</p>
                        <p>c. To avoid getting into a position where we abandon bombing of the North
                            in return for the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> entering into
                            negotiations while still continuing major support of the Viet Cong. This
                            is an essential point in itself, made more so by our public statements
                            that we would suspend or cease bombing only if Hanoi took appropriate
                            corresponding action with respect to its support of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>d. If a reciprocal reduction in hostilities should result, to avoid
                            getting into a situation in the South in which the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> was not able to go about restoring its
                            control throughout the country.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Discussion</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If our primary objective is to move Hanoi toward a peaceful solution, it
                            means that we must frame our communications to them and all our public
                            discussion in such a way as to play down the threat of stronger action
                            in the event the pause fails; in other words, we must not appear to be
                            delivering an ultimatum. Yet we must recognize that, even if we do not
                            stress what we will do if the pause fails, and even if we do not take
                            preparatory actions for additional measures, it will be widely assumed
                            that we will resume, and we shall almost certainly have to commit
                            ourselves to the GVN to that effect. In other words, we can only seek to
                            play down the element of threat; we cannot fully remove it.</p>
                        <p>A second consequence in the listing of our objectives as above is that we
                            must put the diplomacy of the pause at the very front of our
                            calculations. Our May pause lost effect in the world because it seemed
                            too short and because the negative indications from Hanoi, while
                            conclusive to us, could not really be spelled out to the world. This
                            time, we must have a pause that is long enough and includes enough
                            diplomatic openings so that the most skeptical will be persuaded that it
                            was a serious and honest try. In this respect, there is no latent
                            conflict among the various objectives, for what we do towards Hanoi,
                            even if it cannot be revealed in toto, will strengthen our case with the
                            world.</p>
                        <p rend="center">B. What We Do at the Outset of the Pause</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">1. Nature of Military Action</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. Against the North, we would stop all strikes and armed reconnaissance
                            but would continue Lucky Dragon and Blue Springs (as appropriate) for
                            all North Viet-Nam, and low-level reconnaissance (Blue Tree) in the
                            infiltration areas (south of approximately 20 degrees north latitude and
                            west of 105 degrees west longitude), with peripheral low-level
                            reconnaissance elsewhere. Also sea/air <gloss target="#t_ELINT1">ELINT</gloss> to cover key areas.</p>
                        <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477" facs="0509"/>
                        <p>b. Air operations against Laos (Barrel Roll and Steel Tiger) would be
                            continued and intensified including any effective means such as
                            defoliation.</p>
                        <p>c. Air operations in South Vietnam (including B-52 strikes) would
                            continue as required.</p>
                        <p>d. As to ground operations in South Vietnam, we should continue all
                            aspects, both pacification and search/base area operations. Not only is
                            this almost certainly required in order to secure <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> concurrence and avoid unfavorable
                            developments, but it appears to have no significant disadvantages in
                            terms of effect on Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Discussion</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is a serious issue whether operations in the South should be as
                            stated above. Since one of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            responses we seek is a major reduction in <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> attacks and terrorism the continuation of all US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> operations at then current levels
                            (possibly even increasing as a result of our force increases) might make
                            it harder to identify serious <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            reductions. Thus, there is a case for some reduction of military
                            pressure, particularly in US actions such as the B-52 strikes, at least
                            for a period of 2-3 weeks at the outset of the pause.</p>
                        <p>An opposite alternative, if reassurance to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> were considered crucial, would be to step up activity
                            to a real maximum.</p>
                        <p>The proposal above steers between these two and relies on the continuing
                            arrival of our troops as a major reassuring element to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. In practice, it does not appear that
                            it will be too difficult, even with continuing US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> operations, to identify what happens to
                            the basic attack-incident rate by the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">2. Timing and Duration</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. The best time would appear to be toward the end of November, as our
                            Phase I strength nears its peak but while we are still introducing
                            significant forces (to reassure the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>)
                            under decisions already taken in principle. This timing also allows for
                            an adequate duration before we would have to take or announce further
                            decisions.</p>
                        <p>b. The duration should be not less than four weeks, in order to allow a
                            convincing time for response by action. At the same time, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would almost certainly be strongly
                            opposed to any significantly longer period. Another element is the
                            desirability of terminating the pause with a month or more then elapsing
                            before we came to major new decisions; the point of this is to avoid the
                            conclusion that we paused simply to permit ourselves to resume at a
                            higher level as had always been planned. On balance, a period of about a
                            month seems optimum.</p>
                        <p>c. We must consider whether we should not be prepared to resume short of
                            the planning period, if there are clear negative readings from the <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478" facs="0510"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. For example, our reconnaissance may
                            pick up clear and significant military movements toward the South.
                            Alternatively, the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> might (although
                            we think it unlikely) give an absolutely explicit negative diplomatic
                            response. There might be marginal cases in between, such as the
                            discovery of additional <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> regular
                            units in the South, sent down prior to the pause. We might also have
                            strident and continued DRV propaganda denunciation of the pause; some of
                            this must be expected and discounted, but at a certain level it might be
                            persuasive of a totally negative reading. We cannot decide now just what
                            would constitute a clearly negative <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            response evident before the end of the planning period. Nor can we
                            decide now whether we should let that negative response sink in for a
                            short time even before we resumed. However, we probably should recognize
                            that there may be developments that should properly cause us to resume
                            before the end of the planning period. (We do not necessarily have to
                            say this to others, as we did to Hanoi in May.)</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>a. We must bring Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>
                            fully aboard, and wider elements of the Embassy should be briefed so
                            that our contacts with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> at all
                            levels are used to keep their reactions under control.</p>
                        <p>b. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> should then
                            personally take the lead in explaining the pause to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. (The alternative of a Washington
                            mission working with the Ambassador in the explanation seems less
                            attractive, and undercuts his personal position. But there is a case for
                            this alternative.)</p>
                        <p>c. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> should then be associated in
                            the formal announcement. This seems vital if we are to avoid widespread
                            criticism in South Viet-Nam on the now-familiar basis that the US is
                            acting alone.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> concurrence could well be the
                            stickiest part of the whole operation. In any event, it must not be
                            hasty or forced; yet, the fact that we would have to mention it to at
                            least four top leaders gives us an immediate security problem. Ideally,
                            we should try to get the Ambassador aboard in a consultation in
                            Washington or Honolulu a few days before he goes to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. The approach to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> should then be roughly four days before
                            the initiation of the pause. (If we wish to have <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> couple the pause announcement with a more sweeping
                            declaration of internal policy, as discussed under B 7 below, we would
                            have to allow a longer time to work on that announcement. But it still
                            might be possible to withhold discussion of the pause until very shortly
                            before it was initiated.)</p>
                        <p>In presenting the matter to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, we
                            should of course make maximum use of our continuing Phase I deployment
                            and of our concurrent plan for continued actions within South Vietnam.
                            We could also point out that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            would not be able to take much advantage of a <pb n="479" xml:id="pg_479" facs="0511"/>pause without our knowing it at once.
                            Arguments based on domestic and international opinion factors might also
                            be used, but might be less persuasive than the others indicated.</p>
                        <p>Query if we should indicate to the GVN that we will be prepared to go
                            still further if the pause fails: on the one hand, this would be highly
                            persuasive in bringing them aboard; on the other hand, it forces our
                            hand on Phase II decisions and reduces our flexibility to deal with
                            varied responses to the pause under which, for example, we might wish to
                            resume at a different level and not go forward with major Phase II
                            deployments.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>a. In May, we did not alert any third-country channels, apart from the
                            Soviets, who made clear their unwillingness to act as intermediaries.
                            This time, the public and prolonged nature of the pause imposes no
                            security obstacle, and we should alert every possible channel with Hanoi
                            contacts. We would explain to each of these “useful” countries and
                            parties—as a first crack, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
                            Canada, India, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, France, Japan, Poland,

                            for whatever Hanoi had to say. The fact that we would not wish to
                            continue the pause merely in return for Hanoi's entering into
                            negotiations raises a serious tactical question: Should we make this
                            clear at the outset, or should we say we are interested in any message
                            of any sort? This problem is particularly acute for U Thant. Might the
                            answer be to say that we were interested in indications either of
                            reciprocal action or of willingness to negotiate, but felt highly
                            doubtful that the latter would be persuasive without the former?</p>

                            treatment. There were some indications in May that they resented being
                            singled out, and they have subsequently stressed that they are not
                            intermediaries and that we must deal with Hanoi. It can be argued that
                            they might be more helpful than otherwise if they were treated simply on
                            the same footing as a number of other interested nations, and were told
                            in so many words that this was the case. On the other hand, our over-all
                            relationship with the Soviets might benefit if we sent a private
                            Presidential message noting repeated Soviet references to this very
                            action, expressing the hope that Hanoi would be responsive (while not
                            suggesting any specific action by the Soviets), but equally making clear
                            that we could not lay off indefinitely if action continued in the
                            South.</p>
                        <p>b. There is a question whether we should ask any third country or party
                            to make public appeals to Hanoi. U Thant might have the urge to do so,
                            and of course in the last analysis we could not stop him. However, <pb n="480" xml:id="pg_480" facs="0512"/>the adamant rejection of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> role by the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> seems to make this most unpromising,
                            and it is also likely that U Thant would pitch any appeal (even
                            privately) on the basis of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            getting the bombing stopped for good if it would only agree to
                            negotiate, without taking any other action.</p>

                            We might try to make a rather special production of notification also of
                            countries that have been pressing us on a pause, such as Yugoslavia,
                            India, Ghana, etc.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>a. The public announcement should include the following points:</p>
                        <p>(1) <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and US have agreed that bombings
                            of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> should be suspended “for a
                            significant time” in order to demonstrate <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>/US desire to seek a peaceful solution and in order to
                            see if there will be a constructive response from Hanoi. The length of
                            the pause would not be specified nor would we attempt to indicate just
                            what response was required or anticipated.</p>
                        <p>(2) The announcement would make clear that we would continue to conduct
                            necessary reconnaissance of North Viet-Nam and necessary air and ground
                            operations in South Viet-Nam. We could add some general sentence that
                            “all other relevant operations will continue” to hint clearly that we
                            would go on acting in Laos.</p>
                        <p>b. Backgrounding of the press should not go beyond the public
                            announcement. One point of particular difficulty here is that we are on
                            the public record as insisting on an action response, and not simply a
                            willingness to negotiate. Press speculation may find in our failure to
                            reiterate this position a suggestion that we are ready to settle for the
                            latter.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Discussion</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Several points in the above script are open to question. The arguments
                            against naming a specific duration publicly seem overwhelming. The
                            opposite alternative of making the suspension entirely open-ended has
                            some appeal, but increases the already-present chance that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would leak the agreed duration.
                            Moreover, we have to reckon that we will be dealing with pressures to
                            turn the suspension into a cessation in <pb n="481" xml:id="pg_481" facs="0513"/>any event, and resistance to these might be harder if
                            we had left the thing entirely open.</p>
                        <p>As to the methodology of the announcement, there is the alternative of
                            avoiding formal announcement until press inquiry made it compulsory. On
                            balance, though this had some merit in May, the fact that the press
                            would probably now be considerably more alert, and the fact that this is
                            intended as a much more prolonged operation, argue for putting it right
                            out in the open at the outset.</p>
                        <p>The third issue concerns possible additional elements in the US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> announcement. We have been hoping for
                            some time that an improved military climate would provide a good setting
                            for the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to make a more public and
                            forthcoming statement addressed to the individual members of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, to the general effect that they would be
                            received back into South Vietnamese life if they stopped their armed
                            action and accepted an independent <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                            without <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> influence. If military
                            actions have continued to go well in the period up to the initiation of
                            the pause, we might well be urging such a statement in any case, and it
                            might be a most effective rounding out of the total message (“<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> get out, but deluded brothers come in”)
                            against a background of continuing strength and firmness in pursuing
                            actions within <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. On balance, this
                            looks like a good addition; to do it properly will require careful
                            consultation with a wider circle in the Saigon Embassy than we might
                            otherwise bring in at the outset (notably <persName corresp="#p_LEG1">Lansdale</persName>).</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>a. Chicoms will almost certainly attack pause as US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> “trick.” We should ignore and play down
                            such statements, but react promptly and hard if Chicoms take any
                            military action, separating such reactions from continuation of pause
                            against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> unless the latter has
                            taken some action itself.</p>
                        <p>b. Soviet response may include some public denunciation to keep in line,
                            but will almost certainly be reserved and cautious. One of our hopes
                            must be that the Soviets will get busy with the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to suggest at least a somewhat forthcoming response and
                            even a serious beginning toward a peaceful solution. As stated earlier,
                            any special effort by us with the Soviets to this end would probably not
                            be fruitful, however.</p>
                        <p>c. <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            may well oppose <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> attempts to make any
                            significant response to the pause; they may see any such <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> action as unjustified surrender to the
                            implied US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> threat to resume bombing,
                            i.e., that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would have decided
                            “to save its own skin.” The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> might, on
                            their own, seek to disrupt the pause by some specific terror actions in
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. We should probably strive,
                            necessarily in consultation with the <pb n="482" xml:id="pg_482" facs="0514"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> (which could be hard), not to
                            respond specifically against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to
                            such <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> actions. However, a really major
                            event in the South might compel us, consistently with our over-all
                            theory of Hanoi responsibility, to make a one-shot interruption of the
                            pause in reprisal. This is a tough issue.</p>
                        <p>d. Hanoi's response is of course the most crucial. It is hard to see
                            Hanoi making no response whatever, or confining its response merely to
                            propaganda denunciation. Alone or in combination we might have any one
                            of the following;</p>
                        <p>(1) At attempt to indicate willingness to talk but without any clear
                            change in position. Hanoi might choose this time to say somewhat more
                            clearly that it does not insist on US withdrawal, and it might use a
                            gentle formulation on <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> representation
                            in negotiations. The crux of the matter would be, however, whether there
                            was any change in the insistence on acceptance of the third point, the
                                <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> entering a coalition in
                            Saigon.</p>
                        <p>(2) An attempt to indicate willingness to talk with some clear change on
                            the third point, but possibly without any indication of reducing support
                            to the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>(3) A suggestion that limited responsive action was being taken such as
                            failure to send additional regular units.</p>
                        <p>(4) A suggestion that real responsive action was being taken such as
                            withdrawal or lying low of the 325th Division.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the most troublesome of all possible Hanoi actions would be a
                            message (perhaps through channels sympathetic to such an approach, such
                            as the French) that Hanoi was indeed willing to talk but only if we
                            undertook not to resume the bombing.</p>

                        <p>The variations are so great that it is almost impossible to spell out how
                            we would handle these possibilities. The point would be to shoot down
                            any idea that we would settle merely for willingness to negotiate, while
                            at the same time losing no opportunity to pin Hanoi down to compromises
                            in its present position. Whatever message was conveyed by Hanoi, we
                            would have to weigh carefully what channels to use in reply and how to
                            determine just how far Hanoi was ready to go, without letting ourselves
                            get drawn into a dilatory and fruitless exchange designed on their part
                            to make it extremely difficult for us to resume.</p>
                        <p>The possibility that we might be drawn into at least preliminary
                            negotiations requires that we review again our negotiating position and
                            see if there are any areas where we could show further “give”—as we have
                            done during the summer on the reunification issue and, verbally at
                            least, on <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> representation.</p>

                        <p>Most of the “useful” countries would probably not put pressure on us to
                            extend the suspension into a cessation. However, there would <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0515"/>undoubtedly be many countries and
                            voices raised in this direction. Our general course of action would seem
                            to be to avoid getting drawn into the issue, let our announcement speak
                            for itself, and keep our mouths shut. However, we might be faced even
                            with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions or other formal
                            actions that we would have to combat.</p>
                        <p>A second form of international pressure might arise to extend the
                            suspension into a “ceasefire” in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.
                            Apart from the obvious <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> opposition to
                            any such extension, we ourselves would be squarely opposed to it because
                            of the difficulties we have always seen, notably the danger that a total
                            “ceasefire” would consolidate the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            position in secure areas and get us into a Pathet Lao type of situation.
                            Our line of defense should probably be that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and we are entitled to go on dealing with the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> as long as it continues active, and that
                            any suggestion of a complete “ceasefire” is premature until we have seen
                            whether a more limited reduction of hostilities is possible first. On
                            the whole, it would appear probable that we could contain pressures for
                            a complete “ceasefire” at least from our responsible domestic critics,
                            but the general heat on this subject is one of the significant
                            difficulties in the operation.</p>

                        <p>By hypothesis, we would be continuing already decided Phase I deployments
                            during the pause. Beyond this point, even the possibility of decisions
                            for Phase II deployments may require preparatory measures that will
                            become known. We need an assessment from <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> on this point.</p>
                        <p rend="center">D. Conditions and Method of Resumption</p>
                        <p>1. Basically, we would expect to resume at the end of the agreed period
                            unless we were satisfied that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            had made a response that gave really serious and continuing promise of
                            leading toward a peaceful solution. Undoubtedly, the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> will have tried to muddy the record as
                            much as possible; however, it would have to weigh any attempt to portray
                            itself as having changed position or taken action against the morale
                            drawbacks, particularly vis-a-vis the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>,
                            of such a public position. It might not be too difficult to make up our
                            own minds that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> was not
                            responding, but we should be thinking always of the kind of record we
                            could make with key allies and other countries to prove that our reading
                            was correct.</p>
                        <p>2. When and as we decided to resume, we should probably make a clear and
                            firm public announcement of just what we were doing and why.</p>
                        <p>3. The pace of resumption needs careful thought. From the military
                            standpoint, renewed destruction of the LOC in the southern areas of the
                            DRV would appear the first requirement. However, we might start with <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0516"/>some targets at the northern
                            limits of present strikes to emphasize that we were resuming at least on
                            the old basis.</p>
                        <p>There is an issue whether we should resume with a “bang”, by some strike
                            beyond present geographic and category limits. This cannot be decided in
                            advance. The case for such extension would be strong if Hanoi had been
                            drastically negative, but even in this case we would have to weigh
                            whether such action, in an atmosphere where tension would go up
                            automatically, might be more likely to produce air battles or Chicom
                            responses that we would still not wish to have to deal with.</p>
                        <p>Another element in our initial targeting might, of course, be the
                            intervening extension of the <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> system.
                            If we had to hit a number of <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> sites
                            for reasons of military necessity, this in itself would give a
                            considerable psychological “bang” although with much less chance of
                            escalation risks that might attend geographic or category
                            extensions.</p>
                        <p>4. Finally, there is the question of what additional actions we would
                            then take to increase our pressures in the South. If the pause had made
                            our case clear to the world, we would be in a stronger position to go
                            ahead with greater reinforcements along Phase II lines. But, as noted
                            earlier, we would probably do well to allow a period to elapse before we
                            announced major new decisions. One factor here is that we must not, for
                            future purposes, get our pauses characterized as simply devices to
                            justify major new measures. If the pause does not work this time, its
                            usefulness for the future should still be preserved if possible.</p>

                            stations. Our problems are formidable: the difficulty of communication

                        </p>
                        <p>A. <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> (through Depuy) makes a strong
                            case that we cannot keep up adequate pressure on the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> without additional deployments totalling
                            about 115,000 men during the course of 1966, raising our total to
                            325,000 by the end of the year. While the Depuy presentation may be
                            unduly pessimistic in assuming that VC morale will stay up and that they
                            will be able to obtain adequate equipment and even reinforcements, it is
                            also possible (though I think less so) that it errs in the other
                            direction by not assuming a really major <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> effort to increase forces in the South. At the very
                            least, Depuy seems realistic in stating that we shall probably have to
                            make a major additional commitment to attain our basic objectives, and
                            that even with a second phase we cannot say with anything like absolute
                            assurance that we are going to get there. Somewhere along the line the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> will probably weaken, and this may
                            be well short of filling in Depuy's bar charts in blue and green. But we
                            have to have the worst case constantly in mind, and the realistic median
                            view would be that we do have to do a great deal more.</p>
                        <p>B. If both the American public and international opinion are to accept
                            our doing a great deal more, even on the ground in the South without <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0519"/>an expansion of bombing of the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, we have to worry about whether
                            we have a convincing case that we have exhausted all avenues to
                            negotiation. We are currently in a fairly easy position on this because
                            of universal reading that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>'s
                            September statements<note n="5" xml:id="d181fn5">See <ref target="#d152fn2">footnote 2, Document 152</ref>.</note> add up
                            to a rejection of negotiations. For the moment, there is no favorable
                            negotiating effort going on on any front, with the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> effort being known privately to us (and
                            we would suspect to other key countries) to have elicited no response
                            from Hanoi. At the same time, the strength of our position of
                            willingness to negotiate is being slightly eroded by the interpretation
                            put out by Senator Mansfield and others and the apparent diplomatic
                            reading in Washington that we have hardened and are really set to fight
                            the thing through to the end, even including the erroneous exaggerated
                            interpretation that we intend a total military victory over the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> for its own sake, as opposed to whatever
                            degree of pressure will induce the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and
                            Hanoi to lay off and turn to a political line, which is what we still
                            really intend. The noises out of Saigon, both from the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and from our Embassy's dealings with
                            the press, have also tended to confuse matters and to confound the
                            perhaps legitimate point that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            needs time to get its house in order with the illegitimate conclusion
                            that they and we could not live with negotiations and that we really are
                            both opposed to it whatever we say in public. In sum, our posture cannot
                            be considered firm and wholly tenable if we look ahead 3-6 months
                            without further moves.</p>
                        <p>C. On the other hand, any demonstrable move toward a peaceful solution,
                            such as a pause in the next three months, raises the most serious
                            questions of creating misunderstanding in Hanoi and/or interrupting the
                            slow effort we are making to build some real political structure in
                            Saigon. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>'s 1377 makes it
                            perfectly clear how he would react initially to a pause, and one cannot
                            dismiss his reading of the internal political situation as simply due to
                            his own personal rather superficial view of things. At the very best, we
                            have a major tactical job to do to bring <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> aboard
                            if we are to make a major move such as a pause.</p>
                        <p>D. The Depuy briefing was somewhat reassuring as to the degree of US
                            casualties we may expect (N.B. it would help to see a projection of this
                            in terms of casualties per committed battalion per month accepting
                            Depuy's judgment that the present rate can be maintained). Nonetheless,
                            we are faced with the pressures from various quarters, symbolized by
                            General LeMay and the Ford/Adair line, to hit the North substantially
                            harder. The degree to which this will rise during the next 3-6 months
                            will depend heavily on actual casualty experience and also on the
                            proportion of apparent successes to apparent reverses (any really
                            adverse engagement could really set the pressures off).</p>

                            well be substance to the report from Matseev, the Isvestia
                            correspondent, to Robert Kleiman to the effect that the Soviets would
                            like to see a pause of at least three weeks to get diplomatic pressures
                            started that might bring Hanoi onto a negotiating track.<note n="6" xml:id="d181fn6">

                            argues strongly for a pause. Equally, it almost certainly argues against
                            any real step-up in the bombing, and was a major factor in the <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> Group conclusion that this
                            was not wise, for this reason as well as because it would probably not
                            have a favorable effect on Hanoi in the absence of greater progress than
                            we have yet achieved in the South.<note n="7" xml:id="d181fn7">See <ref target="#d164">Document 164</ref>.</note>

                        </p>
                        <p>A. A serious pause for a month, followed—if it fails—by decisions on
                            Phase II deployment and possibly by some step-up in the bombing of the
                            North. On the objective international factors, this has a great deal to
                            commend it. It would clear the decks in a convincing fashion and
                            probably tend to reduce the dangers of escalation even after we had
                            resumed, at least as to the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, as noted above, bringing the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> (and <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>)
                            aboard would be terribly difficult just in itself, and we must have
                            serious doubts whether it would have an adverse effect on <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> solidity. Any major falling out between
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and the US, or any overturn in
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> political structure, could at
                            this stage set us back enormously, if not fatally.</p>
                        <p>Another contrary argument is that it might at least confuse our message
                            to Hanoi and justify their tendency to think that, despite all our
                            actions, we are really looking for an easy way out. We could offset this
                            to some degree by the kind of message we get through to them and by our
                            continued actions in the South, but there would still be some chance
                            that the hard-liners in Hanoi would read it the other way
                            notwithstanding. In other words, it could conceivably be a step away
                            from getting Hanoi to seeking a peaceful solution.</p>
                        <p>Still a third element would be the US domestic reaction. There would be a
                            lot of rumbling below decks and among the harder-action school of
                            critics. This might be kept under control during the pause, but it could
                            also mean that the pressures would be enormous thereafter to “really
                            clobber” the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>B. Finish up Phase I deployments and proceed to Phase II decisions and
                            actions without any major action such as a pause, or any appreciable
                            change in the bombing pattern against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0521"/>
                        <p>In terms of effect on Hanoi and Saigon, this might quite well be the best
                            course. It would indicate steadiness and firmness, as well as patience,
                            and it can be strongly argued that this will bring Hanoi to a peaceful
                            solution more surely and perhaps even sooner than any other course.</p>
                        <p>The major adverse argument is that the President would have to go through
                            another round of major decision-making in which our soft-line critics,
                            both here and abroad, would raise a great deal of noise that we were not
                            leaving the door sufficiently open to negotiation and that we were
                            really moving inexorably to a wider war. It is hard to say just how
                            serious these pressures would be, but at the very least we should give
                            thought to some less dramatic alternative to a pause—such as another
                            third country mediation effort—that would somewhat dampen these
                            pressures without the adverse effects we might see in a pause in terms
                            of Hanoi and Saigon reaction. It is far from easy to see just what such
                            a “pause alternative” might be, and one cannot identify off-hand any
                            effective or persuasive mediator who would be willing to act in the
                            absence of a pause.</p>
                        <p>C. Complete Phase I deployments and stop at that point for perhaps three
                            months before going further, while continuing the present bombing pace
                            against the North.</p>
                        <p>This course, too, can be argued persuasively. It will be January before
                            the weight of our full Phase I effort really comes into play, and,
                            despite the gaps identified in the Depuy analysis (notably the total
                            absence of effort in the IV Corps), we might see at least a significant
                            adverse morale trend in the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> that would
                            indicate we were getting somewhere.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, it may be useful to give ourselves time to digest the impact of
                            200,000 men in terms of their effect on the Vietnamese psychology and
                            economy. This is a factor that some reports, notably a recent cable from
                            Saigon on inflationary and labor/diversion problems,<note n="8" xml:id="d181fn8">Not further identified.</note> suggest may be
                            becoming very serious, even to the point of being a real limiting factor
                            on our basic effectiveness in appealing to the people.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would have additional
                            time, hopefully without serious frictions with us, to get on with its
                            part of the job and to build up a <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            contribution that would not be dwarfed by the US role, a present
                            tendency sharply highlighted by Depuy's presentation.</p>
                        <p>On the drawback side, deferring additional US deployments—particularly in
                            the face of military recommendations that would almost certainly become
                            known—raises extremely grave problems in our domestic situation. This is
                            not solely a question of the war dragging on—which it <pb n="490" xml:id="pg_490" facs="0522"/>can be argued it would be likely to do
                            even with Phase II deployments—but rather, a question of our confronting
                            the 1966 Congressional elections without having clearly done all that
                            our military thought was wise just on the ground alone (leaving aside
                            the problem of extended bombing of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>). It would be still more serious, of course, if the
                            rate of progress slowed down, as is certainly a significant
                            possibility.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>As noted above, Course B needs the best possible “pause alternative.”
                            Course C, just by the passage of time, has somewhat the same problem but
                            far less acutely.</p>
                        <p>Both courses, in addition, raise questions on the policy of bombing the
                            North. The Soviet and international argument against expanding our
                            bombing will remain very cogent. But we have always agreed that they
                            might be outweighed by the arguments in favor of a final “coup de grace”
                            when Hanoi and the VC really find the going in the South extremely
                            difficult. On balance, the objective case would seem to favor not
                            expanding the bombing except as a “coup de grace” or conceivably on a
                            one-shot reprisal basis for some really serious VC outrage for which we
                            could find some parallel target. In one respect, the continuation and
                            growth of US domestic pressures is an asset to us, in that they will
                            keep alive Hanoi's fears that “hawk” views would ultimately prevail in
                            the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>There are a number of factors that could vary the situation, which we
                            should follow closely, and on some of which we simply are not adequately
                            informed. These include:</p>
                        <p>A. What is really happening with respect to <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> infiltration. We probably need to stress the bombings
                            of Laos very heavily, and may wish to divert some part of our <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> air effort to this end. We also need a
                            much better intelligence picture than now exists of how much equipment
                            and reinforcement is really coming down, and how.</p>
                        <p>If we become convinced that individual targets such as Phu Quoc Island
                            are really heavily contributing to infiltration, might we not conduct a
                            specific amphibious operation against these?</p>
                        <p>B. We need to follow extremely closely what the ChiComs and Soviets are
                            doing in the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. This may well
                            increase, and could suggest at any point that we were nearing some kind
                            of flash signal.</p>
                        <p>C. South Vietnamese popular reactions to the process will have to
                            continue to be followed extremely closely. We are reasonably satisfied
                            with our current reading that we have not triggered significant adverse
                            reactions either by our presence or by our military tactics, including
                            air <pb n="491" xml:id="pg_491" facs="0523"/>attacks on villages. But we
                            surely need to have an acute watch on this and perhaps—as <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> is looking into—tighter control on
                            the use of air.</p>
                        <p>D. The extent of civilian damage resulting from our <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> attacks also needs a great deal of
                            watching and possibly a review of what we are doing. The recent
                            compilation of photographs of Nam Dinh casts grave doubt on any claim
                            that we can hit urban areas in any surgical fashion. Another cause for
                            concern is the number of unspecified “buildings” being hit by our armed
                            recce. Apart from humanitarian considerations, the degree of civilian
                            damage in the North probably tends to stiffen <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> toughness, and may increasingly give the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> a propaganda weapon against us, which
                            it now seems they are making a considerable effort to mount.</p>
                        <p>E. In addition to the civilian damage element, our <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> bombing pattern is being looked at from
                            the standpoint of simple effectiveness. It is disturbing to get reports
                            that bridges have been re-built in the southern areas of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and then not struck again. Are we
                            focussing enough, as a primary and irreducible objective, on keeping key
                                <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> out of action?</p>
                        <p>F. Even the possibility of a pause, or a “pause alternative,” means that
                            we must look hard again at our over-all negotiating position. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>'s special group has done
                            some further work on this, but our thoughts are not nearly as clear as
                            they should be, nor—perhaps above all—have they thoroughly been shared
                            with Saigon, as Lodge's 1377 highlights. It may be that <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alexis Johnson</persName> would be the man to pull
                            this together into a much more definitive script than we now have. I do
                            not myself see any major change or “give” that we should now display.
                            This, too, needs a hard look in addition to the question of tactical
                            arguments and handling.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The pause scenario has suggested that the best time for such action, if
                            taken, might be late November. This means bringing Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> aboard in the middle of
                            November, and it may well be that this could only be done at
                            Presidential level. Another factor is the absence of Secretary Rusk from
                            November 13 till November 25, roughly. How and where are we to consult
                            with Lodge, and how are we to get through to him a somewhat different
                            outlook on the whole subject, even if we should eventually decide not to
                            do the pause itself? Washington seems indicated, but we must decide very
                            soon.</p>
                        <p>Obviously, a major factor is the degree of visibility of our
                            decision-making. With the President in Texas, major and prolonged
                            gatherings are much more difficult to conceal.</p>

                            talks with the International Committee of the Red Cross (<gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>) and others in Vienna and Geneva.
                            Most of the topics were reported in telegrams to the Department. However
                            this report may be useful as a summary and as an indication of possible

                            critical state. In a letter to President Gonard of the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> sent August 10 Secretary Rusk stated
                            “In regard to the hostilities in Viet-Nam the U.S. Government is
                            applying the provisions of the Geneva Conventions and we expect the

                            subsequent letter the Secretary told M. Gonard that, “In view of the
                            fact that prisoners taken by United States forces are transferred
                            promptly to the Government of the Republic of Viet-Nam, we think it is
                            more appropriate for that Government to supply such lists and to arrange
                            for such visits by International Committee representatives, and we have
                            every reason to believe that it will do so. You will recall that the
                            Government of the Republic of Viet-Nam informed your representatives on
                            August 11 that it will fulfill its obligations in this regard under the

                        <p>Up to the present the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has failed to
                            comply with the Conventions in a number of important ways. It has not
                            furnished the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> with lists of
                            prisoners. It has refused to permit the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> delegate in Saigon to make the kind of unescorted
                            visits to prisoner camps that he believes are his responsibility under
                            the Conventions. As far as I know it has taken no steps to transmit
                            prisoner mail to relatives. Nor has it established a central office for
                            collecting names of prisoners as required by the Conventions. In
                            addition, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> thesis that all but a
                            handful of the thousands of prisoners in custody are refugees or
                            criminals subject to trial under domestic law is unlikely to convince
                            the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="493" xml:id="pg_493" facs="0525"/>
                        <p>The matter is acute for several reasons:</p>
                        <p>(a)The <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> may publicly criticize the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> for failure to comply with the
                            conventions. This would reduce the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s
                            already precarious standing in the eyes of many other countries.</p>
                        <p>(b) As long as <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> compliance is
                            incomplete U.S. military forces in Viet-Nam are obligated not to turn
                            over prisoners they take to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            custody.</p>
                        <p>(c) <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> non-compliance inhibits our
                            ability to take public or private actions to obtain better treatment for
                            American military personnel held by the Viet Cong and the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> attitude on this subject, while
                            understandable in light of what their country has endured at the hands
                            of the Viet Cong, and conceivably explainable to someone on the spot who
                            can see at first hand the character of this ugly war, is however
                            virtually certain to be unacceptable as a permanent answer to the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>'s repeated entreaties on this
                            subject. This will be all the more so if the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, which already is substantially complying with
                            important parts of the prisoners Convention by furnishing in some
                            instances at least names, photographs, statements, and mail, takes
                            specific public steps to comply formally with the Conventions. It is by
                            no means out of the question that the DRV will do this. From their own
                            point of view there is little reason (beyond their own fanaticism) why
                            they should not.</p>
                        <p>Nor is there any valid reason why the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            should not comply. The steps outlined in <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 863 of September 25<note n="4" xml:id="d182fn4">Not
                                printed. (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27-7 VIET)</note> should be fully
                            acceptable and could serve to enhance the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s reputation with its own population. A change in
                            definitions so that the bulk of prisoners taken in military operations
                            be classified in the first instance as subject to the protection of the
                            Conventions should not cause serious inconvenience. Since education or
                            indoctrination programs free of duress are not proscribed by the
                            Conventions the <persName corresp="#p_Chieu1">Chieu Hoi</persName>
                            program could continue. Individual terrorists convicted of specific acts
                            could still be charged as criminals and handled outside the Conventions.
                            Refugees who are rehabilitated could of course be freed to return to
                            their villages.</p>
                        <p>It is worth noting that the narrowness of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> category of prisoners undermines our thesis that this
                            is more than a civil war. Our critics can be expected to fasten on to
                            the fact that only 74 of the thousands of prisoners captured or in
                            custody represent an external force and use this as further evidence of
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> non-involvement. By altering the
                            language of the definition large numbers of detainees could be
                            classified as affiliated with Viet Cong-<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> armed forces fighting in South Viet-Nam against the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. This would not only have
                            important legal and propaganda advantages, it would also square with the
                            facts as we know them.</p>
                        <pb n="494" xml:id="pg_494" facs="0526"/>
                        <p>If the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> delegates in Saigon are not
                            satisfied with the degree of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            compliance very soon the US Government must examine its own position
                            very carefully. For one thing, our mission should take care not to place
                            itself between the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, explaining the one to the other and,
                            ultimately, satisfying neither. The <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> should go direct to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, the Ministries of Defense and Interior as well as the
                            Foreign Office, to explain their obligations under the Conventions and
                            in turn to hear from the Vietnamese themselves what they are doing to
                            comply. The U.S. position must be squarely on the side of the
                            Conventions. If the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> delegates
                            aren't able to make their case with sufficient force to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> Ministries of Interior and Defense, the
                            U.S. mission should be instructed to approach the Saigon Government at
                            the highest level to explain the importance of full and prompt
                            compliance.</p>
                        <p>In the meanwhile, consideration should be given to having U.S. forces
                            keep prisoners they actually capture. The present policy set forth in
                            the Joint State-Defense message of September 24 (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 858 to Saigon)<note n="5" xml:id="d182fn5">Not printed. (Ibid.)</note> provides that lists be
                            kept of prisoners turned over to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. The additional step of holding at least some prisoners
                            would not only keep us in compliance with the Conventions during the
                            time that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is in the process of
                            working itself up to this, it would also provide us with a small amount
                            of additional leverage for use in connection with a possible exchange of
                            prisoners with the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> or even,
                            conceivably, with the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Prisoner exchanges</hi>. The <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> is aware of our interest in this
                            subject. They also understand the problems. The fact that we hold no
                            prisoners, and that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> so far has
                            not asked their assistance in this regard, does not help matters. The
                                <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> understand the special nature
                            of the Hertz case, though the argument that he as a bona fide civilian
                            held by the Viet Cong is unique is beginning to wear a bit thin now that
                            Dodd, the civilian construction firm employee, has been captured, to say
                            nothing of the three other civilians believed held by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Blockade of medical supplies.</hi> This is obviously
                            a most difficult and delicate matter, which was raised several times by
                            the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>, both in conference and in
                            private conversations. Without seeking to examine the pro's and con's of
                            the policy, let me just note that the legal argument justifying it will
                            be subject to the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>'s critical
                            scrutiny. The moral question depends to some extent at least on how the
                            policy is carried out and what consequences it has both for the Viet
                            Cong wounded and for civilians in Viet Cong-held areas.</p>
                        <p>To be sure, to some extent it depends on how the policy is stated. The
                                <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> is less likely to object if
                            emphasis is put on the fact that captured medical supplies are not
                            marked with a Red Cross and are comingled <pb n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0527"/>with military supplies, in contravention of the
                            Conventions. But the policy cannot be phrased that way just for the
                            benefit of the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>. This is not a
                            subject on which it would be wise to try to delude or mislead the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>, for short as well as long run
                            reasons. However, a policy carried out on such terms could very likely
                            lead to the interdiction of virtually as many medical supplies as are
                            presently blockaded.</p>

                        <p>As a result of a communication sent to National Red Cross Societies on
                            August 11 concerning relief action on behalf of victims of the war in
                            Viet-Nam, the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> had received by
                            September 20 donations in cash and in kind of a total of about 600,000
                            Swiss francs ($140,000). These donations came from National Red Cross
                            Societies of: Australia, Denmark, Ethiopia, Finland, Ireland, Japan,
                            Lebanon, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway and Switzerland; and from the
                            Governments of Sweden and Switzerland as well as from the Viet-Nam
                            Relief Committee in Finland and the Oxford Committee for Famine Relief
                            in Britain. Many of the donors requested that the goods in kind or funds
                            be made available to “all three sides”, apparently not including the
                            U.S. as a party to the war. From these gifts the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> sent a consignment consisting mainly
                            of medical supplies to the Viet Cong through the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> representative in Moscow. It has not yet received any
                            acknowledgment. If an acknowledgment is received, it may well be the
                            opening of a channel of communication to the Viet Cong. Several members
                            of the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> pointed out to me that they
                            are hopeful that gifts to the Viet Cong may help gain the confidence of
                            the Viet Cong—an essential precondition for any useful actions by the
                            Red Cross with regard to prisoners or other aspects of the
                            Conventions.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Cambodia.</hi> I was informed that the Cambodians
                            feel that if they act as a channel to send packages to U.S. prisoners
                            held by the Viet Cong, and even more if they help send medical supplies
                            to the Viet Cong, the U.S. will view this as confirming evidence of our
                            charges, which they deny, that their country serves as a pipeline for
                            supplies going to the Viet Cong. Whether or not any of this is accurate,
                            either as a statement of the facts or as a characterization of their
                            views, it might well be useful, and could do no harm, to have an
                            intermediary act on our behalf to assure Sihanouk that, far from
                            criticizing efforts by his Red Cross to get packages to our prisoners,
                            we would be most grateful, and that we would not be publicly critical if
                            bona fide medical supplies went to the Viet Cong at the same time, if in
                            fact that is our view.</p>

                            of means to establish contact and establish a relationship of confidence
                                <pb n="496" xml:id="pg_496" facs="0528"/>with the DRV and the Viet
                            Cong. They have sought out the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> representatives in Moscow,
                            Prague, Budapest, Paris, and Phnom Penh. They used a forum like the
                            Vienna conference to make additional contacts. They have enlisted the
                            Red Cross leadership of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
                            Cambodia, Indonesia, France, Britain, and other countries for this
                            purpose. They have applied for a visa to Hanoi in Warsaw and elsewhere.
                            While they remain wholly realistic and thus non-optimistic about these
                            efforts the possibility remains that one or more may at any time bear
                            fruit. Most likely would be an invitation from Hanoi for an <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> visit, possibly accompanied by a
                            request for supplies, conceivably accepting our proposal that the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> inspect their allegations of hospital
                            and leprosarium bombings. If such a visit occurred the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> would seek to visit prisoners
                            (including Americans) held by the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>,
                            and would attempt to take them packages and mail. It would also discuss
                            conditions of prisoners and related matters with the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. It is not too soon to consider
                            additional matters we might wish the ICRC to explore if such a visit
                            were to take place.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">Note:</hi> while the visa application is in the name

                            believe) my understanding is that if the visa is granted President
                            Gonard might himself seek to make the trip, accompanied by staff and
                            possibly by other members of the Committee.)</p>
                        <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Character and Role of <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>.</hi> It hardly needs saying that the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> as a private Swiss organization with
                            unique legal and international responsibilities acts independently on
                            the basis of its own judgment consistent with its well known principles.
                            What may be less obvious is that constituted this way and behaving this
                            way the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> is almost certain to serve
                            our own interests. Plainly, this is a point to be made quietly. Any
                            prospects for success the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> may have
                            in the delicate undertakings that it is broaching in connection with the
                            Viet-Nam conflict would be shattered if the other side were given public
                            cause to doubt its independence. But the fact remains that individually
                            and collectively the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> is, in the
                            most basic sense, on our side. This is very specifically true of the
                            President, Samuel Gonard, formerly the commanding general of the Swiss
                            armed forces, and of his leading associate of the Committee, Vice
                            President Jacques Freymond, Director of the Graduate Institute of
                            International Studies in Geneva. (Freymond's views on wars of national
                            liberation, and the urgent need for the countries of Europe to find ways
                            to get together on a united policy for the West to fight them, as
                            expressed in a paper he wrote for a recent Ford-sponsored conference,
                            are wholly congenial to U.S. policy—and somewhat unusual coming from a
                            European intellectual.)</p>
                        <p>In light of this I believe that the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>
                            does not at present need additional specific proposals. A suggestion
                            like that in <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 651 to
                                Geneva,<note n="6" xml:id="d182fn6">Not printed. (Ibid.)</note>
                            <pb n="497" xml:id="pg_497" facs="0529"/>besides being overtaken by the
                                <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>'s own initiative in sending
                            medical supplies to the Viet Cong, might well sound a wrong note among
                            the more conservative members of the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>, who in the reductive tradition of European
                            intellectualism might well conclude the proposal was a deal partial to
                            U.S. interests and thus not for them to implement. Our present
                            relationship with the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> is such that
                            it can best be served by maintaining an open channel of discussion with
                            them, with occasional nudges from us to point them in directions we
                            consider fruitful and/or essential. And by getting the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to comply with the Conventions.</p>

                            point, publicity now for our efforts to work with and through the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> might well interfere with their
                            efforts to gain the confidence of the other side and thus obtain better
                            treatment for our prisoners. The argument that maximum publicity will
                            help get better treatment for U.S. prisoners and will make it harder for
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to conduct mock war crimes
                            trials and carry out executions, even if valid, does not contravene this
                            view, since such publicity could be sought without reference to the
                                <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The domestic U.S. problem is more serious. The families obviously want to
                            know what we're doing to help the boys, as do the military services.
                            Congressional interest is building up. To a point this can be handled by
                            quiet off-the-record briefings. But that point will soon be reached.</p>
                        <p>I discussed this problem with members and staff of the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>. They themselves are becoming more
                            public relations conscious than has been their tradition. They are
                            interested in our own methods of backgrounding and news dissemination.
                            At the right time I believe they will release on their own initiative,
                            or can be gotten to release some information on what they are doing for
                            the benefit of U.S. prisoners. By coordinating in advance we could then
                            give their release our own emphasis here. I am convinced this would be
                            more satisfactory for the present than for us to attempt to background
                            here.</p>

                            Without going into details of present shortcomings, suffice it to say
                            that a lot can be done to beef up the South Vietnamese Red Cross. And at
                            relatively little cost or difficulty (with respect to the Conventions,
                            for example) to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. The areas of
                            need are obvious: refugees, direct material aid, children, separated
                            families, etc. Putting the South Vietnamese Red Cross more into the
                            picture would assist efforts being made by other private groups, would
                            enhance the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>'s image abroad, and
                            would deflect attention from shortcomings of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in other areas. Both the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> and the American Red Cross would do much more with the
                            Vietnamese Red Cross. But the requests should come from them. A specific
                            project within their competence would be to set up a tracing service to
                            reunite families, both now and when the fighting ends. The <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> could provide technical assistance
                            for this.</p>

                        <p>1. As we prepare for later discussions with the President on future
                            policy in Vietnam, we are all eager for your personal comments on some
                            of the major problems. Since there is no immediate prospect of meeting
                            with you, we would like to use this channel for informational exchanges
                            in the next few weeks. We count on you to reply in whatever way is
                            convenient to you, and we are not seeking formal Embassy or <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> positions so much as the benefit of
                            your own thinking in whatever form you wish to present it.</p>
                        <p>2. Last week we listened with great interest to <persName corresp="#p_DPMGWE1">De Puy</persName>
                            <note n="2" xml:id="d183fn2">See <ref target="#d181fn2">footnote 2,
                                    Document 181</ref>.</note> in his preliminary presentation of
                            Phase II plans. While we are impressed by the high quality of the
                            thinking behind this plan, a number of questions have occurred to
                            different ones of us on which we would value your early comment.</p>
                        <pb n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0531"/>
                        <p>3. As presented, these plans focus sharply upon a dominant fighting role
                            for U.S. ground forces. They appear to imply that aggressive operations
                            will be conducted almost exclusively by U.S. forces. We recognize that
                            for planners it is vastly easier to plan in terms of the deployment and
                            use of U.S. forces under direct U.S. command. But some of us are greatly
                            concerned by the possibility that what began as a Vietnamese war with
                            U.S. assistance may end as a U.S. war with only passive Vietnamese
                            cooperation. We doubt if this is your plan, but we fear that the
                            momentum of U.S. military planning and deployment may force us all in
                            this direction if we do not take very strong action to insure maximum
                            use of Vietnamese forces in all forms of combat. It may be that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DPMGWE1">De Puy</persName> briefing has misled
                            us because of its natural focus upon the role of additional U.S. troops
                            suggested for Phase II. But in reaching conclusions on Phase II and
                            related problems, we would all be helped if we could have a clearer
                            picture of the efforts you currently envisage for strengthening the
                            Vietnamese armed forces at all levels and for all purposes.</p>
                        <p>4. Some of us also wonder whether we adequately understand what is now
                            happening in Vietnam. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> losses are
                            still running several times higher than those of U.S. forces, and we
                            believe, on the basis of estimates here, that most Viet Cong casualties
                            still come from engagements in which the ground forces on our side are
                            mainly Vietnamese. Thus there appears to be a substantial difference
                            between the war as it now is and the war as the Phase II briefing
                            suggests that it may be next year. Your comments on this apparent
                            discrepancy would be welcome.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_DPMGWE1">De Puy</persName>'s briefing relates to
                            the situation on the ground in South Vietnam, and did not directly treat
                            the question of air operations either in the South or in the North.
                            There is an evident requirement on us for correlation of all military
                            action in the theater, and we would be glad to know of your thinking
                            about the relation between ground and air action in the South, and the
                            relation of both to the various possible rates at which the Rolling
                            Thunder campaign might be carried forward.</p>
                        <p>6. Finally, we face major political decisions in connection with any
                            additional deployments, and it may well be that we would wish to precede
                            any Phase II deployments by another pause in bombing the North. Our
                            preliminary estimate is that any such pause would be unlikely to produce
                            a satisfactory response from Hanoi and would simply demonstrate again
                            that root of problem of war and peace is in Hanoi. Here again we would
                            value your thinking on ways and means of executing such a political
                            preliminary to a further buildup.</p>
                        <p>7. Very existence of this message series will be held extremely closely
                            here. You can speak as freely on this channel as if you were at the
                            Cabinet table in a carefully restricted meeting. We will do the
                            same.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. The cumulative economic losses caused by air strikes in North Vietnam
                            are still small in relation to total economic activity because the
                            targets attacked thus far have not been located in areas of major
                            economic activity. However, there are now considerably more indications
                            of localized strains upon the economy, most notably in food supply and
                            distribution. The bombings of the railway lines leading from Hanoi to
                            the northwest and northeast are probably having a greater adverse effect
                            on the economy than any targets attacked to date. With the interdiction
                            of three important land lines of communication, domestic production,
                            distribution, and reconstruction are being curtailed and exports and
                            imports are being reduced. Another serious effect is the diversion of
                            scarce resources from productive uses to the repair of damaged
                            facilities and development and the use of alternate means of
                            transportation. This diversion has almost certainly retarded, if not
                            stopped, work on a number of high-priority economic construction
                            projects. The capabilities of North Vietnam's armed forces have not been
                            affected significantly by attacks on economic facilities, but the
                            movement of personnel, equipment, and supplies is being hampered by
                            damaged transportation facilities. The armed forces place little direct
                            reliance on the North Vietnamese economy for materiel.</p>
                        <p>2. Damage to economic facilities and equipment is now estimated at
                            between $15 and 16 million. Measurable indirect economic losses amount
                            to more than $8 million—mainly reductions in foreign trade and
                            agricultural output. The direct economic losses that can be measured
                            have fallen most heavily on the transport sector of the economy. The
                            cost of permanent reconstruction of rail/highway bridges would be on the
                            order of $7 to 8 million and the replacement or repair of destroyed or
                            damaged transport equipment would cost an additional $3.3 million.
                            Reconstruction of the damaged electric power plants would cost about
                            $4.5 million. Repair costs for the petroleum storage facilities are
                            estimated at about $500 thousand. The growing loss of foreign export
                                earnings—<pb n="501" xml:id="pg_501" facs="0533"/>now totaling
                            almost $5 million—is appreciable, though not yet serious. In addition
                            there have been losses from lowered production. Most losses cannot be
                            quantified, but it is estimated that the potential reduction in rice
                            crops this year resulting from shortages of power for irrigation will
                            amount to roughly $3.5 million. The cost of reconstruction, replacement,
                            and repair of damaged facilities, if attempted, would represent over 7
                            percent of total annual investment in the economy and about 15 percent
                            of annual investment in industry.</p>
                        <p>3. The official North Vietnam press has tacitly admitted failure to carry
                            out simultaneously all the necessary defense, reconstruction, and
                            production tasks. Party leaders have called for a major reorganization
                            of the Communist Party apparatus in order to strengthen the provincial
                            and district committees of the party. These officials have primary
                            responsibility for directing defense mobilization and production in
                            their respective regions. Thus problems in organization are compounding
                            the chronic shortages of skilled manpower which have become even more
                            apparent during the period of the air strikes. Large numbers of workers
                            have been sent south to repair the damage. Their effectiveness has been
                            impaired, however, by severe local shortages of food and construction
                            materials caused by poor distribution and problems in transportation.
                            Some of the effects of the shortage of skilled manpower may be avoided,
                            however, by the arrival of additional Soviet and Chinese technical
                            personnel. North Vietnam is now receiving increasing numbers of
                            technical advisers to assist in reconstruction as well as quantities of
                            structural components and materials, not only from China, but also from
                            other Communist countries. The transfer of a considerable portion of
                            North Vietnam's limited resources of skilled labor and construction
                            materials to repair and reconstruct the bombed facilities constitutes an
                            appreciable drain in amounts available for the planned investment
                            program and has required a reordering of investment priorities. If
                            orderly economic development is to be continued, there must be a more
                            rapid increase in aid from other Communist countries than has been
                            observed to date.</p>
                        <p>4. The most significant air strikes against transportation in North
                            Vietnam have been the bombing of two bridges on the Dong Dang-Hanoi
                            railroad line. The Dong Dang-Hanoi line is the principal means by which
                            North Vietnam has received imports of military equipment and economic
                            goods from China by land. The organization of alternative road and sea
                            transportation to compensate for the loss of through rail traffic will
                            take some time. In the meantime, the North Vietnamese will resort to
                            temporary expedients to try to keep military and high-priority economic
                            traffic moving past and interdicted bridges. Continued interdiction of
                            the line will have serious consequences in maintaining production of the
                            two blast furnaces at Thai Nguyen, North Vietnam's only <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0534"/>iron and steel complex, which has been
                            receiving about 500 tons of coking coal from China by rail each day.</p>
                        <p>5. North Vietnam has made little progress in repairing damaged electrical
                            power facilities. Damage to five power plants has reduced the total
                            generating capacity by 13.5 percent, and has caused minor curtailment of
                            mining and industrial operations and loss of power for an irrigation
                            system. Destroyed petroleum storage facilities reduced total capacity by
                            16.7 percent. Since total national capacity is large in relation to
                            normal consumption, the loss of these facilities has had only a
                            localized impact in the southern part of the country. Dislocations in
                            telecommunications have necessitated the use of priorities and alternate
                            means of communication, and the effectiveness of postal service has
                            declined. Food rations in an area south of Hanoi reportedly have been
                            cut, and food shortages are reported to be particularly serious in the
                            southern provinces. The bombings of the electric power network in Thanh
                            Hoa and Nghe An provinces have interrupted normal irrigation services
                            which, if not restored, will cause a reduction in the fall rice harvests
                            in these areas. The volume of seaborne exports continues to decline and
                            the loss of foreign exchange earnings has been intensified.</p>

                        <p>6. There continues to be no basic change in Hanoi's attitude toward the
                            war. Hanoi continues to assert its determination to press on with the
                            war in South Vietnam despite the continuing attrition of the air war and
                            the increase of US troops in the south. This determination was evident
                            in regime propaganda which placed special emphasis on assertions that
                            the US is not prepared to conduct a prolonged war in Vietnam, but that
                            the Vietnamese insurgents are prepared to do so and have the necessary
                            resources.</p>
                        <p>7. On the subject of negotiations, Hanoi was unusually vocal. Coverage of
                            this issue centered on a Foreign Ministry memorandum broadcast on 23
                            September. This and other statements offered no policy departure from
                            the “four-point stand” of 8 April. Rather, by phrasing, emphasis and
                            omission, these statements tend to convey the impression that Hanoi is
                            endeavoring to clarify its position on settling the war and to avoid
                            locking itself into an inflexible position on negotiations.</p>
                        <p>8. There are no indications that the Hanoi regime's attitude toward the
                            war is being influenced to any greater extent than in the past by the
                            reaction of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> populace to the air
                            strikes. The morale of the populace seems to be standing up fairly well,
                            although signs of deterioration in some quarters continue. For the first
                            time in many weeks the regime did evidence some concern over the effect
                            that the air strikes were having on the populace. A broadcast directed
                            to the populace of one region of the country chided them for failing to
                            comply with the planned civil defense measures when strikes occur. The
                            broadcast implied that the <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0535"/>local people had little regard for the government's plans and took
                            their own measures to protect themselves.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Effects on Military Targets</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>9. Air strikes against North Vietnam have further eroded national
                            capacities in measurable areas (see annex),<note n="3" xml:id="d184fn3">Attached but not printed.</note> while far-ranging armed
                            reconnaissance has disrupted movement along lines of communication and
                            North Vietnamese attempts at reconstruction. Further reduction in
                            national capacities in certain categories will be inhibited to some
                            extent by the heavy concentration of targets in the sanctuary areas.
                            About 51 percent of maritime ports, and about 60 percent of <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>, power plant, and railroad yard
                            capacities are within the restricted areas. However, only 10 percent of
                            barracks, 14 percent of supply, and 15 percent of ammunition storage
                            capacities are located in these areas. The continued absence of
                            restoration of barracks and supply and ammunition depots confirms
                            earlier assessments that a large-scale dispersal of men and materials to
                            less vulnerable facilities has occurred. No indications of shortages of
                            ammunition have been detected, and the movement of such materiel is
                            given top priority on the disrupted transportation nets.</p>
                        <p>10. The four damaged airfields at Vinh, Dong Hoi, Na San, and Dien Bien
                            Phu remain unserviceable. The North Vietnamese appear to be discarding
                            these facilities and concentrating on improving and reactivating
                            airfields in and north of the Hanoi area.</p>
                        <p>11. Armed reconnaissance sorties passed 11,000 with an attendant increase
                            in destruction of surface vessels, vehicles and railroad rolling stock.
                            While these losses have disrupted North Vietnamese operations,
                            particularly in Military Region IV, they are being offset in part by
                            increased aid from the Communist countries. Similarly, although our air
                            operations have restricted North Vietnam's freedom of movement,
                            especially in the southern provinces, infiltration of materiel to the
                            Viet Cong continues.</p>
                        <p>12. Increased pressure has been placed on Hanoi by the sustained air
                            attacks on the more sensitive lines of communication and on their supply
                            base. While these operations have not significantly reduced North
                            Vietnamese capabilities to conduct current levels of defense operations,
                            they have substantially curtailed the <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss>'s capability to invade South Vietnam. Quick reaction
                            paid dividends last week when an air strike was launched against an
                            occupied <gloss target="#t_SA21">SA-2</gloss> site near Kep Ha within 48
                            hours of the site's detection. The attack surprised the North Vietnamese
                            and resulted in destruction of missiles, radar vans, and missile
                            transporters, marking the first successful attack on such a site. The
                            losses incurred constitute a sharp setback to North Vietnamese plans for
                                <pb n="504" xml:id="pg_504" facs="0536"/>augmenting SA-2 firing
                            elements northeast of Hanoi. Nevertheless, North Vietnam is steadily
                            increasing its <gloss target="#t_AAA1">AAA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SA21">SA-2</gloss> sites, primarily in the Yen Bai and
                            Lang Son areas, and <gloss target="#t_SA21">SA-2</gloss> firing elements
                            are now in operation to the south, east, and north of Hanoi. The mission
                            of the armed forces of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> is
                            unchanged and includes: defending the homeland, training their own and
                            infiltration forces for South Vietnam and Laos, and providing logistics
                            support for their forces and those Communist forces presently deployed
                            in South Vietnam and Laos. To the present, the capability of North
                            Vietnam's armed forces to perform their mission at current levels of
                            activity, while hampered, has not been diminished to an appreciable
                            degree.</p>

                        <p>1532. 1. <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> government is just over
                            four months old. While certain strengths are apparent certain stresses
                            within and outside the government also exist. Trouble spots have
                            appeared although the overall situation in Viet-Nam is better today than
                            it was in the early part of 1965. Behind the shield of American power a
                            greater measure of security has been established but the political and
                            administrative fabric has not yet developed the necessary strength. This
                            report is designed to outline some of the problems which <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> now confronts as he seeks to retain
                            unity among the leadership and develop effective government.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> is well aware of his
                            problems. He recognizes the need for actions and persuasive leadership
                            if he is to survive the pressures threatening a government massively
                            engaged in fighting a bitter war that reaches into almost every corner
                            of the land and affects every facet of Vietnamese life.</p>
                        <p>3. Government is faced with complex and potentially dangerous economic
                            problem in form of shortages certain commodities, sharply rising living
                            costs, and inflation. Important as these are intrinsically, they take on
                            greater importance because they have become magnified in the public mind
                            and provide political enemies of government a “safe” weapon for attack.
                            Too timorous to launch a head-on campaign against military government,
                            these elements consider themselves quite safe in associating with
                            spontaneous complaint against inflation and food shortages.</p>
                        <p>4. Situation has also produced internal stresses within <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> Cabinet. Minister National Economy
                            Ton was under such heavy fire that he was talking of resigning. Although
                                <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> and Directorate colleagues
                            considered his replacement it appears that Ton has survived for the time
                            being. Merits of case aside, there is always powerful impulse to fire a
                            minister when his area of responsibility presents politically difficult
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>5. Pressures for change exist elsewhere within government. The Minister
                            of Interior is unsure of his job. Minister of Public Works and Minister
                            of Social Welfare have been drawing criticism because of alleged
                            failures of their Ministries to function effectively. (Friday <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> told Ambassador he had dismissed
                            Minister of Public Works because of his inefficiency, but this has not
                            yet been made known publicly.)</p>
                        <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0538"/>
                        <p>6. There continues to be grumbling within the military establishment.
                            DepPriMin <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Nguyen Huu Co</persName> is
                            apparently still unhappy at being relieved from post of Chief, Joint
                            General Staff. He has criticized <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> sharply before American and Vietnamese auditors on a
                            number of occasions and word of his remarks has circulated widely in
                            civilian and military circles (and must certainly have been carried back
                            to <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>). In a recent conversation
                            with General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_Co1">Co</persName> wondered out loud whether
                            anything could be done to deflate <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>'s arrogance and force his nose to the grindstone.
                            This is probably an unfair attack on <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> but illustrates the lengths to which <persName corresp="#p_Co1">Co</persName> is now going in his criticism. We
                            have also been hearing of milder criticism of <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> from other senior military quarters.</p>
                        <p>7. There is a rash of coup rumors, although none are worthy of my trying
                            to react in any way. Before his departure for Hue, Bonze Thich Tri Quang
                            called to warn EmbOff that at least three sudiste groups he knows of are
                            plotting. Adherents to General “Big” Minh and Major General Duong Van
                            Duc, September 13-14 coup leader, are allegedly involved. Story is given
                            substance by fact that <persName corresp="#p_NDT1">Duc</persName> was
                            forcibly removed from Ba Xuyen Province last week by military security
                            service and returned to Saigon (where he was set free) presumably at
                            request of Province Chief who objected to his activities. Re “Big” Minh,
                            town has been full of stories of his imminent return for last two weeks.
                            As we have seen in past, Saigon rumor mills need little raw material in
                            order to operate at full blast. We have also noted that VC are quick to
                            pick up and broadcast stories of disunity within <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. We can assume that they are not idle now. While coup
                            reports so far appear to have no firm basis, their currency is a
                            manifestation of the difficulties within the government. They have
                            become so common that <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> has seen
                            fit to denounce the possibility of a coup. Most recently he told press
                            no one could organize a coup at the present time.</p>
                        <p>8. On Catholic side of ledger there has been rumor that Generals
                                <persName corresp="#p_NCT1">Nguyen Chanh Thi</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Nguyen Huu Co</persName> were plotting
                            to become Chief of State and Prime Minister respectively with Unified
                            Buddhist Association concurrence and support. Central Buddhists headed
                            by <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> remain highly
                            critical of government effectiveness and of General <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName> in particular, while old
                            political circles continue to grumble on the sidelines. Catholic circles
                            have been remaining quiet and not agitating against the government but
                            they are basically uncommitted in support of the <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> government.</p>
                        <p>9. Much of foregoing would be irrelevant and unimportant if <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> government could generate momentum
                            and successfully come to grips with more important problems confronting
                            it. However, on basis past experience, rumors and facts of this sort can
                            have insidious effect on minds of many Vietnamese. As the government
                            steels into its tasks for a <pb n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0539"/>longer haul the “out-politicians” launch what have often been
                            irresponsible attacks against government. Members of government are more
                            fully aware of the enormity of tasks confronting them and are forced to
                            come to grips with the hard task of maintaining unity and getting on
                            with the work of government. Some of them, it appears, would rather
                            think of sudden change as a solution.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> does not give any obvious
                            outward sign of running out of steam. He remains self-assured and has
                            declared his determination remain as Prime Minister regardless number
                            and magnitude problems confronting him. He is being responsive to the
                            Ambassador's advice to calm his opponents, seek out his critics, and
                            maintain his authority by persuasion as well as action. He appears more
                            and more as a reflective man. He retains control of the air force and
                            his potential rivals seem to show a healthy respect for U.S. power and
                            some consideration for the desirability of maintaining unity in
                            government. Although <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> has not
                            been receiving the credit due his successes, he has had a few. More than
                            anything, favorable trends in military solution over past few months
                            have strengthened government's position and dampened earlier fears for
                            security which fostered irrational changes and inspired adventures in
                            leadership.</p>
                        <p>11. Important to recall that Directorate unity remains key to political
                            stability in present situation. As long as ten Generals who comprise
                            this body remain in essential accord on this point, coups which bring
                            about fundamental changes in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s
                            organization or direction can probably be avoided. However, pressures
                            such as those outlined above are putting their unity to an important
                            test.</p>

                        <p>1544. For the President. Herewith my weekly telegram.</p>
                        <p>1. American popularity—You would have been proud of the U.S. troops at
                            the Vietnam National Day celebration on last Monday, November 1. They
                            looked lean and hard—and tall coming after the Vietnamese. The white and
                            Negro soldiers were inter-mingled—a powerful psychological stroke to a
                            crowd conservatively estimated of non-whites. What particularly
                            impressed me was that when, with their massed flags, they appeared, they
                            were the only troops which drew a great roar of applause from the
                            public. Other formations had drawn applause from the reviewing stand but
                            the crowd of rank and file people on the sidewalk applauded only the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>When I attended this same celebration two years ago, the public was
                            nowhere to be seen and was not allowed to be present. Today was the
                            first time everyone was allowed to see the parade. The government's
                            self-assurance was justified, for there was no terrorism.</p>
                        <p>In the afternoon I attended the National Day ceremony at the Buddhist
                            Institute. Mine was the only vehicle, either diplomatic or Vietnamese,
                            which, with its flag, received warm and grinning applause from the crowd
                            outside the pagoda.</p>
                        <p>We Americans are definitely not considered colonial. They think they know
                            us and our non-imperialistic record in the Philippines and Korea and
                            elsewhere. They know that our soldiers are helpful and friendly.
                            Unfortunately the Army of Vietnam still makes enemies.</p>
                        <p>2. Economic—Happily, retail rice prices continued their slow downward
                            trend despite a continued decline in rice stocks on hand and despite the
                            fact that prices normally rise at this season. Saigon's needs in rice,
                            which are largely met from private stocks, should be provided for at a
                            reasonable price.</p>
                        <p>The cost of other local and imported products continued to rise, however,
                            and the retail price index was up 3 percent over last week.</p>
                        <p>American and Vietnamese representatives agreed on a number of measures to
                            speed up cargo handling and reduce congestion in the port of Saigon.</p>
                        <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0541"/>
                        <p>3. Military—For the third week in a row the pace of the war quickened
                            with the Viet Cong attacking in regimental strength in Phu Yen Province
                            and in battalion strength in Hau Nghia Province and against the U.S.
                            Marines' perimeter outside Danang. Heavy fighting mostly in a battle
                            zone stretching from Phu Yen Province north to Thua Thien Province led
                            to increased casualties on both sides.</p>
                        <p>The total number of Viet Cong incidents decreased slightly reflecting a
                            decline in the number of anti-aircraft fire and propaganda incidents but
                            the number of Viet Cong attacks went up and terrorism and sabotage
                            increased slightly.</p>
                        <p>4. Basic political—The number of Viet Cong military or political cadres
                            who came over to the government side during October increased slightly
                            over the September figure continuing a slight but steady upward trend
                            since June.</p>
                        <p>5. Psychological—Press comment reflected optimism and hopefulness that
                            traditional differences among South Vietnamese religious minorities were
                            diminishing. Press attitudes toward the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> were generally favorable although complaints continued
                            concerning rising and fluctuating prices and the preference for an
                            elected government.</p>
                        <p>6. Pacification—Minister <persName corresp="#p_Thang1">Thang</persName>
                            of Rural Construction (Pacification) is in the final phase of organizing
                            his Ministry so that he will be free for field supervision of the
                            pacification program in Quang Nam and Binh Dinh starting November 5.
                            After considerable neglect of the program these past two years, and the
                            resignation of most of the Ministry's civilian staff after the death of
                            Minister Ung, Thang has worked hard to get a competent staff, a doctrine
                            designed to win the voluntary support of villagers, with democratic
                            elections in villages as one major goal, and to make some order out of
                            the many types of cadres assigned to this work by past governments. He
                            got <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> approval for his selection of
                            Colonels Lac, <persName corresp="#p_TC1">Chau</persName>, and Anh to be
                            his chief assistants. All three are highly regarded by Americans for
                            their experience and competency in pacification; the latter two have
                            been outstanding province chiefs.</p>
                        <p>The political action team training center at Vung Tau, started, funded,
                            and guided by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, will be made into a
                            national training center for what the Vietnamese call rural construction
                            and which is truthfully translated as community building. I have visited
                            this center and was favorably impressed. Now the Vietnamese want it to
                            play a key role in building a political structure in this country from
                            the ground up. Also, 73 selected graduates of the National Institute for
                            Administration (NIA) are being given a special course in pacification.
                                <persName corresp="#p_Thang1">Thang</persName>, who has been
                            participating in this training of selected civil service civilians, will
                            assign the top third in the class to be assistant district chiefs (or
                            district chief, if this is required) in areas selected for priority
                            attention; the middle third of the <pb n="510" xml:id="pg_510" facs="0542"/>class will be used at Vung Tau to strengthen the
                            instructor staff; the last third will be used in the Ministry.</p>
                        <p>7. Medical program—With a party of journalists, I visited <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> aided hospital at Can Tho where major
                            surgery cases went from 86 in 1963 to 170 in 1965 and minor surgery from
                            30 to 623 in the same period. Outpatient cases went from some 3,300 in
                            1964 to some 6,600 in 1965.</p>
                        <p>I also used the opportunity to have a long private talk with the Corps
                            Commander (one of four political satraps in this country) about the
                            importance of national unity and of everyone pulling together.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>Herewith is my best attempt to peer into the future:</p>
                        <p>1. We are beginning to master the technique of thwarting and eventually
                            overcoming the Viet Cong main force units and military redoubts. The
                            process will be long and difficult, but we know what is required to
                            accomplish it.</p>
                        <p>2. The next step must be to eliminate Viet Cong terrorism and to smash
                            Viet Cong organization in the villages. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, with our help, is just beginning this process.</p>
                        <p>3. If governmental stability is maintained, I believe that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, with our help, can succeed. But the
                            process is, if anything, more complex than the military one because it
                            involves braiding so many programs <pb n="511" xml:id="pg_511" facs="0543"/>together. If the pacification program moves ahead as we
                            intend, I would expect that, within six months, about 300 additional
                            villages of the 2,685 in the country for a total of about 1,100 will
                            have been pacified in the three different areas which are the initial
                            objectives. From then on, it will be straightforward, if slow, plowing
                            ahead with the light at the end of the tunnel growing brighter all the
                            time.</p>
                        <p>4. No assurance can be given that the government will stay in power. But
                            I try to leave nothing undone to prevent a sudden change. Everyone in
                            the U.S. Mission is alerted to let me know of any rumor that they hear,
                            and whenever I hear one worthy of attention, I will certainly try to do
                            something effective.</p>
                        <p>5. Let us assume that the government stays in power and that the Viet
                            Cong decide that we and the Vietnamese are able to overcome the
                            terrorists as individuals and in small groups. I expect them then to
                            accept our offer for unconditional discussions and to do so at the time
                            and in the way most embarrassing to us. I do not expect to hear through
                            intelligence ahead of time. Mao Tse-tung's manual says, “Fight, Fight.
                            Talk, Talk.” When the fighting goes against them, they will try to win
                            by talking, by politics, by propaganda, by public opinion. They go to an
                            international discussion not to end the war but to win it.</p>
                        <p>6. The three most embarrassing things which I can think of now are: 1. a
                            cease-fire; 2. an end to the bombing of the North; and 3. recognition of
                            the Viet Cong (self-styled National Liberation Front) in some form. Let
                            me submit my views on each of these issues.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Cease-Fire</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>7. As things stand now, if we were to accept a cease-fire (without
                            supervision and without withdrawal of troops), the Government of
                            Viet-Nam would be seriously threatened and could even fall, and the
                            fighting spirit would go out of the Vietnamese military—beyond
                            reasonable hope of being pumped up again. The Viet Cong would thus win
                            in one diplomatic stroke what they had not been able to win by
                            fighting.</p>
                        <p>8. Moreover, since civilian pacification still lags behind the military
                            program, a premature cease-fire would confirm Viet Cong control in a
                            large portion of the country, enable them to terrorize the population in
                            much of the remainder and would do so in an artful way without seeming
                            to do so.</p>
                        <p>9. An offer of cease-fire has a superficially attractive appearance and
                            yet at the U.N. an offer of cease-fire was not generally considered
                            worthy of respect unless it was accompanied at the same time by an offer
                            by the aggressor to withdraw troops, together with a practical scheme to
                            supervise the withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>10. One answer to a cease-fire proposal, therefore, could be a.) a
                            cease-fire must be accompanied by the aggressor's withdrawal of troops
                                <pb n="512" xml:id="pg_512" facs="0544"/>and by machinery to
                            supervise and verify; and b.) these are obviously things to be discussed
                            at the meeting and should go on the agenda.</p>
                        <p>11. But I stress the communist tactic of inscribing as an agenda item the
                            substantive result which they wish finally to achieve at a conference.
                            We think of an agenda as a list of things to discuss; they think of it
                            as an opportunity to win the conference before it has even started.</p>
                        <p>12. We should thus insist that the first item on the agenda should be
                            machinery to supervise and to verify whatever agreement is ultimately
                            reached.</p>
                        <p>13. We should also hold that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has
                            a sovereign right to move anywhere in its territory and to suppress
                            armed terrorists where it finds them. This is an exercise of the
                            domestic police power which no sovereign state should be asked to
                            abdicate.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Bombing</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>14. An end of bombing of the North with no other quid pro quo than the
                            opening of negotiations would load the dice in favor of the communists
                            and demoralize the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. It would in
                            effect leave the communists free to devastate the South with impunity
                            while we tie our hands in the North.<note n="2" xml:id="d188fn2">President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> quoted

                        </p>
                        <p>15. We might agree to end the bombing of the North for a limited
                            period—say thirty days—if the following conditions are met:</p>
                        <p>a. A withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> units through
                            international checkpoints to the North.</p>
                        <p>b. Unimpeded access of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to any
                            part of its territory.</p>
                        <p>c. A significant reduction of incidents.</p>
                        <p>d. Cessation of infiltration of men and materiel.</p>
                        <p>e. If enforcement of all these measures is the first item of any
                            agenda.</p>
                        <p>16. Your advisers might study the merits of making a new discussion offer
                            in which you said in effect that on April 8<note n="3" xml:id="d188fn3">Reference is to Johnson's April 7 speech at Johns Hopkins
                                University; see vol. II, <ref target="#d245">Document
                                245</ref>.</note> you offered unconditional discussions and were
                            rebuffed; that this offer had stood from April 8 to the present time;
                            that it was not, however, an offer to last through all eternity; and
                            that, therefore, you were revising it along the lines of paragraph 15.
                            Such an initiative might relieve you of the embarrassment of a communist
                            cease-fire proposal by making in effect a cease-fire proposal of your
                            own.</p>
                        <p>17. Such a public announcement, like all public announcements, should be
                            coordinated in advance with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Recognition of Viet Cong</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>18. Any form of recognition of the Viet Cong—other than as individual
                            members of a Hanoi delegation—will lead to a collapse of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. It would be taken in the
                            countryside—and so represented by the still potent communist
                            underground—as the beginning of a communist takeover. This would, I
                            believe, lead to a rapid disintegration of all we have sacrificed so
                            much to create.</p>
                        <p>19. I would therefore suggest that our attitude on this be that the Viet
                            Cong will not be recognized, though Hanoi is free to include in its
                            delegation any individual it chooses.</p>
                        <p>20. I would hate to see you in a position where you had to choose between
                            flying in the face of overwhelming U.S. public opinion on the one hand
                            or losing everything you have gained with so much struggle and sacrifice
                            in Viet-Nam on the other.</p>
                        <p>21. I believe it will be possible to reconcile U.S. and Vietnamese
                            positions with regard to the holding of discussions with Hanoi, but
                            American opinion must be prepared to give a little ground inasmuch as
                            the Vietnamese have a very different viewpoint, due to their being so
                            close to the conflict and so small and weak a nation, which has suffered
                            so much. Also they take themselves seriously as a sovereign nation—and
                            thus cannot accept a cease-fire for their own troops in their own
                            country in the exercise of their own police power.</p>

                            North Vietnam and the July approval of Phase I deployments make sense
                            only if they are in support of a long-run United States policy to
                            contain Communist China. China—like Germany in 1917, like Germany in the
                            West and Japan in the East in the late 30's, and like the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in 1947—looms as a major power
                            threatening to undercut our importance and effectiveness in the world
                            and, more remotely but more menacingly, to organize all of Asia against
                            us. The long-run US policy is based upon an instinctive understanding in
                            our country that the peoples and resources of Asia could be effectively
                            mobilized against us by China or by a Chinese coalition and that the
                            potential weight of such a coalition could throw us on the defensive and
                            threaten our security. This understanding of a straightforward security
                            threat is interwoven with another perception—namely, that we have our
                            view of the way the US should be moving and of the need for the majority
                            of the rest of the world to be moving in the same direction if we are to
                            achieve our national objective. We would move toward economic
                            well-being, toward open societies, and toward cooperation between
                            nations; the role we have inherited and have chosen for ourselves for
                            the future is to extend our influence and power to thwart ideologies
                            that are hostile to <pb n="515" xml:id="pg_515" facs="0547"/>these aims
                            and to move the world, as best we can, in the direction we prefer. Our
                            ends cannot be achieved and our leadership role cannot be played if some
                            powerful and virulent nation—whether Germany, Japan, Russia or China—is
                            allowed to organize their part of the world according to a philosophy
                            contrary to ours.</p>
                        <p>There are three fronts to a long-run effort to contain China (realizing
                            that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> “contains” China on the
                            north and northwest): (a) the Japan-Korea front; (b) the India-Pakistan
                            front; and (c) the Southeast Asia front. Decisions to make great
                            investments today in men, money and national honor in South Vietnam
                            makes sense only in conjunction with continuing efforts of equivalent
                            effectiveness in the rest of Southeast Asia and on the other two
                            principal fronts. The trends in Asia are running in both directions—for
                            as well as against our interests; there is no reason to be unduly
                            pessimistic about our ability over the next decade or two to fashion
                            alliances and combinations (involving especially Japan and India) which
                            will keep China from achieving her objectives until her zeal wanes. The
                            job, however—even if we can shift some responsibilities to some Asian
                            countries—will continue to require American attention, money, and, from
                            time to time unfortunately, lives.</p>
                        <p>Any decision to continue the program of bombing North Vietnam and any
                            decision to deploy Phase II forces—involving as they do substantial loss
                            of American lives, risks of further escalation, and greater investment
                            of US prestige—must be predicated on these premises as to our long-run
                            interests in Asia.</p>

                            forces have also substantially secured their own bases and the areas

                        <p>But the pace of the war remains high, with <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> last week attacking in regimental strength in Phu Yen
                            province and in battalion strength in Hau Nghia province and against the

                            sides. <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> attacks, terrorism and sabotage
                            show no sign of abating. Desertions from Government Forces remain high,
                            but recruitment has improved, permitting a gradual increase in force
                            levels. Defections from the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are
                            running at 1000 a month and are increasing slowly.</p>
                        <p>The present assessment is that our Phase I deployments (bringing the US
                            total to about 210,000 to 225,000 men) when completed will achieve the
                            limit of their military potential between December 1965 and March 1966.
                            As can be seen on Map I, the estimate is that Phase I forces, working
                            with the Vietnamese, will result in “control” of 40 per cent of the
                            population and 5-10 per cent of the area; it will keep open 20-25 per
                            cent of the critical lines of communications; it will permit 10-20 per
                            cent disruption of the VC bases and military logistics infrastructure,
                            and 5 per cent disruption of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            political/security infrastructure. We will then be in a position where a
                            few enclaves, including perhaps 5,500,000 of South Vietnam's 15,000,000

                            confronted by the US force-build-up and by our program of actions
                            against North Vietnam and with increasing casualties and weapons losses,
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have demonstrated an ability to
                            continue the build-up and supply of their forces in the South, both from
                            in-country sources and by infiltration over improved roads in Laos, by
                            sea and via Cambodia. The indications are that the VC are not reverting
                            to a lesser level of insurgency, but are still striving to build up for

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> forces are now estimated at 71,300
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> “main force and logistics,” 40,000
                            political cadre, and 110,000 guerrillas—an increase in the estimate
                            since early last summer of some 6,000 (9%), 10,000 (33-1/3%) and 18,200
                            (20%) in the three categories respectively. In addition, although as of
                            last month there were estimated to be three regiments of North
                            Vietnamese regular forces in the South, early this month two additional
                            North Vietnamese regiments were confirmed and three others were
                            estimated as possible. In total, therefore, the <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> forces are now
                            believed to number about 230,000 men, and there is reason to believe
                            that they will continue to increase.</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Political.</hi> In Saigon, the <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> “government of generals” has
                            survived, but accomplished little more during the period since last
                            summer. The government, while recognizing many of its problems and
                            working willingly with the US Mission, still lacks any broad, or even
                            developing, base of support among the various political factions. No
                            major faction (e.g., Buddhists, Catholics) is in open opposition, and
                            all appear to be continuing their “wait and see” attitude. This lack of
                            support probably will not be important over the short-run, so long as
                            the generals in power remain united; over the longer term, however, some
                            base of political support must be developed if the non-Communist
                            elements in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> are to become prepared
                            to develop a viable society as security in the countryside is expanded
                            and after hostilities cease.</p>
                        <p>In the countryside, the government's political situation is even worse
                            than in Saigon and other urban centers. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have savagely and thoroughly destroyed the political
                            structure of the rural areas. The potential leaders who could form the
                            nucleus of counter-<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> efforts in each
                            locale have been killed, intimidated or driven out, leaving the old,
                            weak and incompetent behind. Even most of the war veterans are afraid to
                            live in the rural areas and gather in the cities. Absent security (and
                            where there is security, absent willing and able leadership), rural
                            reconstruction (pacification) continues to make little, if any,
                            progress. The very difficult problem of getting pacification moving has
                            not been solved.</p>

                            economic situation today is grave for two reasons: (1) The Communist
                            strategy has been to use some of Vietnam's economy to support the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>'s own operations and to withhold the
                            remainder from the Government and from those of the people who support
                            it. Thus, in large part as a consequence of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> operations, Vietnam has become a food-import area,
                            commodities cannot move freely within the country (e.g., rice from the
                            Delta to Saigon), and the VC are in a position to derive much of their
                            own needs (e.g., construction material, food, medical supplies) from the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. (2) The rapid and large

                            strenuous competition for Vietnam's human and material resources. When

                            the US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> build-up has resulted in a

                            on. It was, and is, my belief that the nine fundamental elements can
                            evolve with or without an express agreement and, except for what might
                            be negotiated incidental to a cease-fire, are more likely to evolve
                            without an express agreement than with one.</p>

                        <p>(a) The area around Saigon and all of the Delta (55 to 60 per cent of the
                            population of South Vietnam), the thickly populated northeastern strip
                            along the coast (25 per cent of the population), and all cities and
                            provincial capitals would be pacified; and all principal roads would be
                            open to the Vietnamese military day and night. (“Pacified” is defined as
                            the existence of a state of mind among the people that they have a stake
                            in the government as shown by the holding of local elections; it also
                            means a proper local police force. A “pacified” area is economically,
                            socially and politically a part of the Republic of Vietnam.)</p>
                        <pb n="519" xml:id="pg_519" facs="0551"/>
                        <p>(b) Those areas not pacified would not be safehavens for the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, but would be contested by energetic

                            and explosives would be removed from their hands. Their main force units
                            would be broken up. Hardcore <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to go to

                            war.</p>
                        <p>(e) The Government of South Vietnam would approve.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> added that “this
                            means that we would not be insisting on the complete elimination of the
                            Viet Cong from all corners of the country although no land or safehaven
                            would be allotted to them. It would mean that we and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would control 80 to 85 per cent of the
                            population and that the Viet Cong would be limited to the jungle and
                            mountainous areas where they would go on as bandits, much as their
                            counterparts do today in Malaya and in Luzon—and where the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would have the right to pursue them and
                            try to destroy them.”</p>
                        <p>The question whether we should be prepared ultimately to settle for a
                            “compromise outcome”—for something less than the terms indicated
                            above—may have to be faced soon. The areas where there may be pressure
                            to ease our terms are these:</p>
                        <p>(a) <hi rend="italic">Safehavens</hi>. The degree to which the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are permitted to hold safehavens tacitly
                            allotted to them; the extent to which the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are permitted to tax in “their” areas and to retain a
                            military organization for “defensive” purposes.</p>
                        <p>(b) <hi rend="italic">Force withdrawals</hi>. The extent to which
                            hardcore <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> on the one hand and US forces
                            on the other must withdraw from South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>(c) <hi rend="italic">Role of <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>
                            </hi>. The extent to which the National Liberation Front is permitted to
                            play a role in the political life of the republic—at local, provincial
                            and national level.</p>
                        <p>Easing of terms in any of these three areas—especially in giving the
                                <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> status in the Saigon
                            government—runs large risks of putting South Vietnam on the skids toward
                            a Communist-controlled government, probably not “Titoist” but rather
                            subservient to China. Furthermore, because of the attitudes of the
                            present Saigon government and because of the importance of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in any compromise gambit, a “compromise
                            outcome” would be very difficult to manage. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would probably support the “favorable outcomes”
                            described above; but the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> almost
                            certainly would not support any “compromise outcome”—especially one
                            which appears to “cede” territory or political recognition to the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Our tactical concern in moving toward any compromise settlement,
                            therefore, is the high probability that the Government of South Vietnam
                                <pb n="520" xml:id="pg_520" facs="0552"/>will shake apart in the
                            process. That is, so far as tactics are concerned, we seem to have the
                            problem that if we lower our sights to a “compromise outcome,” we lose
                            the support of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, making the
                            compromise impossible. (It follows that an essential part of any
                            scenario to compromise would be the creation of a Saigon government not
                            hostile to the compromise course.)</p>
                        <p>On the substantive side of the compromise issue: It should be noted that
                            the decisions that have already been taken this year, and the ones
                            proposed here, are consistent with the strategy stated in paragraph 1
                            and with a striving for a “favorable outcome,” and are probably
                            inconsistent with any lesser objectives or other strategy. Specifically,
                            we may already have passed the “Y” in the road: Our course of action has
                            been and is increasingly becoming inconsistent with any design to
                            settle, through negotiations or otherwise, for a compromise
                            solution—especially one involving Communists in the Saigon government
                            and the consequent high risk of quick Communist take-over.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Tools available.</hi> We have four tools available
                            to us in working toward a solution to the problem in South Vietnam: (a)
                            Military power in South Vietnam, Laos and in the adjacent waters; (b)
                            military interdiction in and pressure on North Vietnam; (c) non-military
                            effort in South Vietnam; and (d) efforts to negotiate.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Military variables.</hi> The military variables are
                            (a) a Pause, (b) Rolling Thunder, and (c) Phase II deployments:</p>
                        <p>a. Pause. An interruption in the program of bombing North Vietnam. The
                            Pause would stand down all strikes and armed reconnaissance in North
                            Vietnam for approximately four weeks unless its futility became apparent
                            earlier. It would not involve stoppage of other reconnaissance or
                            intelligence operations in North Vietnam or of any operations elsewhere.
                            Particularly, ground and air operations in South Vietnam would continue.
                            The Pause would be publicly acknowledged, but a serious effort would be
                            made to avoid advertising it as an ultimatum to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. Third countries would be encouraged to
                            help produce meaningful negotiations and substantial reductions in
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> activity. With respect to termination of the Pause, our
                            state of mind could be (1) “hard-line” or (2) “soft-line”:</p>
                        <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">“Hard-line” Pause</hi>. Under a “hard-line” Pause,
                            we would be firmly resolved to resume bombing unless the Communists were
                            clearly moving toward what is described above as a “favorable outcome.”
                            Special care would be taken to avoid being trapped in a status-quo
                            cease-fire or in negotiations which, though unaccompanied by real
                            concessions by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, made it
                            politically costly for us to terminate the Pause.</p>
                        <p>(2)<hi rend="italic"> “Soft-line” Pause.</hi> Under a “soft-line” Pause,
                            we would be willing to feel our way with respect to termination of the
                            Pause, with less insistence on concrete concessions by the Communists.
                            (This kind of Pause <pb n="521" xml:id="pg_521" facs="0553"/>makes sense
                            only if we are working toward a possible “compromise outcome.”)</p>

                            against North Vietnamese shipping at sea. They would mine the harbors.
                            Every effort would be made to minimize destruction of non-military

                        <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">Deploy Phase II forces</hi>. Deploy 28 additional
                            combat battalions and 4 additional tactical air squadrons and associated
                            support forces (125,000 additional men), bringing the totals to 62 US
                            combat battalions (plus 10 third-country battalions) and 26 US tactical
                            air squadrons, or approximately 350,000 Americans, in South Vietnam.
                            These deployments would be essentially completed by the end of 1966.
                            They could be accomplished without calling up the Reserves or extending
                            tours of duty, but, in that case, they would lead to further reductions
                            in the strength of our strategic reserve to meet contingencies
                            elsewhere. (An alternative would be to call up Reserves—not only
                            replenishing the strategic reserves, but also giving a clear
                            demonstration of US power and purposes.) Expenditures attributable to
                            Phase II for its first 18 months are estimated very roughly to total $3
                            billion.</p>
                        <p>It is estimated—as can be seen on Map II<note n="6" xml:id="d189fn6">Attached but not printed.</note>—that, by the time Phase II forces
                            are making their full impact in the Spring of 1967, the US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would have “control” of 65 per cent of
                            the population and 20-30 per cent of the land; 60-65 per cent of the
                            critical lines of communications would be kept open; 40-50 per cent of
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> bases and military logistical
                            infrastructure would be subject to disruption; and 30 per cent of the

                            would be disrupted.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted that the <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>-proposed Phase II does not allocate any forces to the
                            Delta. To handle the Delta properly, Phase II would have to be augmented
                            by one or two additional divisions—30-60,000 additional men—bringing the
                            Phase II total to 155,000 to 185,000 men.</p>

                            above. It would be extremely difficult to gain public acceptance of this
                            course, in view of the size of the US investment already on the line;
                            and it is very doubtful that a scenario for this course can now be
                            written that would support the strategy in paragraph 1. The scenario
                            probably would end up in disintegration in Vietnam, in political
                            humiliation for the US, and in impaired US political effectiveness on
                            the world scene. It also could lead to more costly confrontations with
                            the Chinese later on.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Course B: No Pause, with evolving <gloss target="#t_RT1">RT</gloss>, with no Phase II</hi>. This is a
                            continuation of the present evolving course of action.</p>
                        <p>This course of action can be supported in this way: (1) It will be
                            January before the weight of our full Phase I effort really comes into
                            play. By then we might see at least a significant adverse morale trend
                            in the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> that would indicate we were
                            getting somewhere. (2) It may be useful to give ourselves time to digest
                            the impact of 225,000 men in terms of their effect on the Vietnamese
                            psychology and economy. This is a factor that some reports, notably a
                            recent cable from Saigon on inflationary and labor division
                                problems,<note n="7" xml:id="d189fn7">Not found.</note> suggest may
                            be becoming very serious, even to the point of being a limiting factor
                            on our basic effectiveness in appealing to the people. (3) It would give
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> additional time, hopefully
                            without serious frictions with us, to get on with its part of the job
                            and to build up a <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> contribution that
                            would not be dwarfed by the US role, a present tendency in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>On the drawback side are two factors: (1) Deferring additional US
                            deployments—particularly in the face of continuing increases in <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> strength—raises grave problems in our
                            domestic situation. This is not solely a question of the war dragging
                            on—which it can be argued it would be likely to do even with Phase II
                            deployments—but rather, a question of not having clearly done all on the
                            ground in Vietnam that appears wise. It would be still more serious, of
                            course, if the rate of progress slowed down, as is likely to be the
                            case. (2) The second drawback is that, by delaying the added
                            deployments, we shall lose momentum in Vietnam—a momentum displaying a
                            determination and confidence that is crucial to the psychology of the
                            confrontation if we are to emerge with an acceptable solution. That is,
                            the product of this course of action is virtually certain to be a
                            stalemate by March 1966 under the unsatisfactory conditions described in
                            paragraph 2 above.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Course C: “Hard-line” Pause, then evolving <gloss target="#t_RT1">RT</gloss> with Phase II.</hi> This course
                            involves all three controversial ingredients—(a) a Pause, (b) an
                            evolving Rolling Thunder, and (c) Phase II deployments.</p>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">Pause.</hi> The arguments for the Pause are four:
                            (1) It would offer the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> a chance to move toward a solution if
                            they should be so inclined—and we continue to receive hints that such
                            may be the state of their minds. (2) It would demonstrate to domestic
                            and international critics that our efforts to settle the war are
                            genuine. (3) It would probably tend to reduce the dangers of escalation
                            after we had resumed the bombing, at least in so far as the Soviets were
                            concerned. And (4) it would set the stage for another Pause, perhaps in
                            late 1966, which might produce a settlement.</p>
                        <pb n="524" xml:id="pg_524" facs="0556"/>
                        <p>Arguments against the Pause are not so much that the North Vietnamese
                            might profit from the respite to repair the damage or to increase
                            infiltration. The arguments are related to Saigon, Hanoi and US
                            hard-liner reactions: (1) In Saigon, bringing the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> aboard would be difficult just in
                            itself, and it could adversely affect <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> solidity. Any major falling out between the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and the US, or any overturn in the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> political structure, could at
                            this stage set us back enormously. (2) In Hanoi, a Pause might at least
                            confuse our message and justify their tendency to think that, despite
                            all our actions, we are really looking for an easy way out. We could
                            offset this to some degree at the time by the kind of message we get
                            through to them and by our continued actions then and later in the
                            South, but there would still be some chance that the hard-liners in
                            Hanoi would read it the other way notwithstanding. In other words, it
                            could conceivably be a step away from getting Hanoi to seek a peaceful
                            solution. (3) In the US, there would be rumbling among the harder-action
                            school of critics. This might be kept under control during the Pause,
                            but it could also mean that the pressures would increase thereafter to
                            hit the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> harder.</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Rolling Thunder.</hi> Intensification of the Rolling

                            accomplish the three fundamentals underlying the bombing program. Those
                            are:</p>

                            (1) to influence the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to negotiate
                            (explicitly or otherwise), and (2) to provide us with a bargaining
                            counter within negotiations.</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">To interdict infiltration</hi>. The program was
                            calculated to reduce the flow of men and supplies from the North to the
                            South—at the least, to put a ceiling on the size of war that the enemy
                            could wage in the South.</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">To demonstrate US commitment</hi>. The program was
                            intended to demonstrate to South Vietnam, North Vietnam and the world
                            the US commitment to see this thing through.</p>
                        <p>While the gradual intensification runs some risk of “flashing” China or
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> into some form of escalation,
                            the risks of this are not great, especially after a Pause, and should be
                            taken in order to keep pressure on the North to stop the aggression in
                            the South.</p>

                            take appropriate action especially on the economic side to offset the
                            shortages and inflation caused by the added US and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> (and <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>)

                            looking for an easy way out; but this fear we should be able to handle.
                            Absent Course <gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss>—or a course similar to
                            it—we are very likely to find ourselves in a stalemate by Spring of next
                            year. The odds are less than even that South Vietnam could hang on for
                            long in that condition; centrifugal forces in the government and
                            society, on which the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have always
                            counted to make up for their inferiority in numbers, would be likely to
                            take over causing an eventual collapse and disintegration of the nation
                            we have been supporting. While a similar stalemate could follow even
                            Course <gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss>, it is considerably less likely
                            and would certainly come later if it happened. The people of South

                            invaded North Vietnam or struck China. As in the case of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, China might react against our ships
                            at sea if she lost a ship to a mine at Haiphong.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>,</hi> like the Soviets, would
                            try during the Pause to maneuver us into a position so that we could not
                            resume the bombing. Later on, under the pressure of the bombing and
                            blockade by us (and fearing the influx of men and influence from China)
                            would probably, over time, look more favorably on a settlement in South
                            Vietnam. At the same time, the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> can
                            be expected to send into Laos and South Vietnam up to several <pb n="526" xml:id="pg_526" facs="0558"/>divisions of regular forces to
                            help the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. As stated in paragraph 2
                            above, there are indications that this is already under way. They could,
                            by such deployments, match our deployments on a 1-for-3 or 1-for-4
                            basis, thus effectively canceling the likelihood that our Phase I and
                            Phase II forces will be able to provide security to areas beyond the
                            enclaves shown on the attached maps. If the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> does this, we could find ourselves in a position where
                            the pressures were great to invade or to bomb the cities in the
                            North—actions which are likely to lead to open war with China if not
                            with the Soviet Union.</p>

                            guerrilla activities, while continuing to strive to build up a
                            conventional military capability. They will depend more and more on
                            regular <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> forces; they will draw
                            harder on the men and material in the areas they control, including the
                            Delta; and they can be expected to try to bring the economy of South
                            Vietnam to a grinding halt. The question, of course, is whether the
                            pressure on the North and the added forces in the South can frustrate
                            these <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> designs.</p>

                            moves recommended in this memorandum are essential to success in
                            Vietnam, but they are not sufficient. The heart of South Vietnam will
                            begin to beat and the body to breathe only when <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> militia, police, intelligence and administrative

                            Government. We are repeatedly told that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is “just now starting” to revitalize this program. We
                            must work hard with the government in Saigon, we must bolster the

                            we must press on with our psychological warfare campaign, and we should
                            be prepared to take a more active role in administration of the
                            provinces and districts—even though it will have some attributes of a
                            “military occupation.” Ambassador Lodge is driving hard in these most
                            difficult areas.</p>
                        <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Actions in Laos.</hi> The pattern of infiltration
                            and <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> force augmentation strongly
                            implies that Laos is being heavily used both as a channel and as a
                            staging base for operations in South Vietnam. We may soon have to expand
                            our air actions in Laos and to initiate large-scale ground operations
                            there. Furthermore, as a part of any Phase III, if the tide of the war
                            has not begun to turn, the time may come to attempt to seal off South
                            Vietnam by land and sea. Contingency plans should therefore be available
                            for the creation of a 175-mile-long anti-infiltration “barrier” to run
                            near the 17th Parallel from the sea to Thailand. Any such barrier would
                            of course have to be complemented by effective measures countering
                            infiltration by sea and from Cambodia. To minimize political costs,
                            Laotian FAR and Thai forces should probably be used at the west end, and
                            Vietnamese and US forces at the east end of the barrier; and Souvanna's
                                <pb n="527" xml:id="pg_527" facs="0559"/>approval should of course
                            be obtained if possible. (In the long term, taking into account the
                            unstable nature of any likely settlement in Vietnam, such a barrier,
                            perhaps manned ultimately by an international force, seems to be an
                            essential.)</p>

                            taken, the US should continue to keep our lines of communication open
                            with friends and enemies alike and should continue to keep our
                            objectives well understood. Specifically, (a) we should continue the
                            dialogue with Moscow, and should keep our ears open for signals from
                            Hanoi or the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, and (b) we should keep
                            our allies and neutrals informed—at best, bestirring them to help toward
                            a solution and, at worst, keeping their opposition within manageable
                            proportions.</p>
                        <p>12. <hi rend="italic">Appraisal.</hi> In view of the stagnation, and
                            therefore the beginnings of disintegration, that is otherwise likely to
                            occur in South Vietnam in early to mid-1966, we seem to have only two
                            major courses open to us. One is to start immediately and carefully to
                            plot a course toward cutting our losses (as listed under Course A in
                            paragraph 6 above); the other is to increase our investment (via Rolling
                            Thunder, Phase II, or both). The former course, as I indicated earlier,
                            is inconsistent both with our strategy for Asia (see paragraph 1) and
                            with our objectives in Vietnam (see paragraph 3). I therefore have
                            recommended that we increase our investment in an effort to make further
                            progress in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Further progress inside Vietnam, beyond that predicted for Spring 1966 in
                            paragraph 2 above, will have to be based on one or more of the following
                            developments:</p>
                        <p>—Snowballing support by the people of South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>—Increases in, and better, South Vietnamese forces.</p>
                        <p>—Additional US or Free World forces.</p>
                        <p>Popular support can be expected to snowball only after there is “hard”
                            security; such security for most of South Vietnam is beyond the
                            immediate horizons. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> force increases
                            and improvements are under way; but they will be slow and insufficient.
                            We are left therefore with the need to deploy additional US or Free
                            World forces.</p>
                        <p>An acceptable and early end to the war, however, turns not only on
                            proving that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> cannot win in the
                            South. It turns also on continuing pressure on the North. Both elements
                            are required.</p>
                        <p>The situation therefore clearly requires the Phase II deployments and
                            probably requires continued evolution of the Rolling Thunder program.
                            The best timing of these actions is debatable—whether they should
                            proceed together or one before the other, and whether action should be
                            postponed by way of a Pause.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Taking into account all considerations—likelihood of
                                success, risk of escalation, South Vietnamese reaction, domestic
                                support, etc.—I favor the tandem, one-after-the-other scenario:
                                Pause, then evolving <gloss target="#t_RT1">RT</gloss>, and then
                                Phase II.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I favor this sequence because I believe that there is a finite chance
                            that a Pause will lead to a reduction in <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> infiltration and in <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            activity (and possibly to profitable negotiations), and because I
                            believe that a Pause is a prerequisite to US public and international
                            acceptance of the stern actions implicit in the evolving Rolling Thunder
                            and Phase II. I favor “evolution” of Rolling Thunder before Phase II
                            deployments because, here too, I believe that there is a finite chance
                            that added pressure on the North, without Phase II deployments, may be
                            enough to bring the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to terms; further, US public acceptance
                            of Phase II deployments will be greater if such a Rolling Thunder
                            program has been given a fair run first.</p>
                        <p>It must be remembered, however, that none of these actions assures
                            success. There is a small but meaningful risk that the course I have
                            recommended—especially the harbor-mining aspect of Rolling Thunder—will
                            lead the Chinese or Russians to escalate the war. US killed-in-action
                            can be expected to increase to 500-800 a month. And the odds are even
                            that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> will hang on doggedly, effectively matching us
                            man-for-man (taking into account the lop-sided guerrilla war ratio
                            advantage), while our efforts may not push the South Vietnamese over the
                            crest of the hill, so that the snowball begins to roll our way. That is,
                            the odds are even that, despite our efforts, we will be faced in early
                            1967 with stagnation at a higher level and with a need to decide whether
                            to deploy Phase III forces, probably in Laos as well as in South
                            Vietnam. And even if my recommended course of action is successful in
                            moving Vietnam toward a “favorable outcome,” it will be difficult to
                            disengage our forces. Any negotiated agreement would, as was the case in
                            Laos, be little better than a reflection of the power situation on the
                            ground. Unless an international force of some kind can be substituted,
                            large numbers of US forces may be required to stay in Vietnam for some
                            time.</p>
                        <p>My overall evaluation is that the best chance of achieving our
                            objectives, and of avoiding a costly national political defeat, lies in
                            the combination of political, economic and military steps described in
                            this memorandum. If carried out vigorously, they stand the best chance
                            of achieving an acceptable resolution of the problem within a reasonable
                            time.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary of the Apostolic Delegation called the Political Section to
                            arrange an appointment for Archbishop Palmas to see me. The date was set
                            for Monday afternoon.<note n="3" xml:id="d191fn3">November 8.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Saturday afternoon I heard rumors of dissatisfaction among some of the
                            Vietnamese Catholic clergy and decided to see Palmas sooner and called
                            at his residence Sunday morning.</p>
                        <p>He wished me to know the following:</p>
                        <p>A “former Vietnamese Cabinet Minister” who, he said, is well known to me,
                            who is reputable and intelligent, and whose name Palmas did not wish to
                            divulge, had called a week ago to say that a “duly accredited”
                            representative of the “National Liberation Front” who had “proper
                            letters of credentials” wished to talk with me. Under questioning from
                            Palmas the former Cabinet Minister said that the purpose of this was to
                            approach me “on the basis of Vietnamese nationalism.” When Palmas asked
                            why they did not wish to speak to the Government of Vietnam, the answer
                            was that they did not trust the Government of Vietnam and that they
                            thought that it was composed entirely of military men who would not
                            perceive political factors. The aim in talking to me would be as
                            Vietnamese nationalists who had achieved independence from the Communist
                            domination of Hanoi. In short, the visit would reflect a desire of the
                            nationalist element in the “National Liberation Front” who apparently
                            were now independent of Hanoi to cease their military activities in the
                            south.</p>
                        <p>Palmas said that obviously if this were what it appeared to be on its
                            face it was a capitulation and was of greatest significance. On the
                            other <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531" facs="0563"/>hand, he was extremely
                            skeptical about it and thought it probably would amount to nothing.</p>
                        <p>Palmas called on <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Tran Van Do</persName> two
                            days ago and, as he said, out of curiosity, asked <persName corresp="#p_Do1">Do</persName> what his reaction would be if someone
                            representing the nationalist element in the so-called “National
                            Liberation Front” were to propose an end of the war. <persName corresp="#p_Do1">Do</persName>'s answer was that such a thing was
                            inconceivable and that the Viet Cong was completely under the domination
                            of Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>My only answer was that I would have to report this to the US Government
                            and await instructions.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> I obviously agree with Palmas that if
                            this were what it appears to be on the surface or in fact a capitulation
                            it would be of the greatest possible significance. But I also share his
                            skepticism. As far as my talking with this individual is concerned, I
                            foresee considerable difficulty due to the fact that I am under constant
                            observation twenty-four hours a day. For one thing the Government of
                            Vietnam follows me around with four men in a jeep wherever I go. In
                            addition I am sure the Viet Cong observe me too. If therefore such an
                            individual were to come to my house or to come to the Chancery it would
                            surely be observed.</p>
                        <p>I asked Palmas what he meant by “duly accredited” and having “a letter of
                            credentials”. I wanted to know who had signed the letter but he said
                            that he did not know, that those were the phrases which his Vietnamese
                            informant had given him.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me highly probable that they would themselves use a
                            relatively junior officer for an initial feeler (hence the need for
                            credentials) while hoping that we would respond at my level. Anything
                            involving me, however, would of course entail severe risks and dangers
                            for us which would require careful study.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, in my judgment, we should first insist, through Palmas, on
                            seeing copy of letter and if satisfied on that point we could consider
                            arranging meeting without me at relatively junior level purely for
                            “size-up” purposes. At that point, we would be in a better position to
                            assess the validity and usefulness of this feeler, without having
                            exposed ourselves in the meantime. Obviously there could be many things
                            which such people would say to no one but me.</p>
                        <p>I am aware that we could be entering a period of such feelers and caution
                            and wariness are needed though no opportunity should be over-looked.

                        <p>1. Agree with you that reported approach could be of utmost significance.
                            Whether or not it could mean capitulation—of which we, like you, are
                            highly skeptical—it might at least mean opening wedge in reaching
                            non-Communist nationalistic elements of <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>. Contacts could provide real indication of how
                            significant such elements are and, by careful handling, we might induce
                            some degree of controversy and split within <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>-Hanoi relations. Even if only result is defection of
                            one or more key individuals, this could be of immense psychological
                            significance.</p>
                        <p>2. We therefore concur wholly in your proposed course of action, asking
                            to see copy of letter and thereafter, depending on contents, arranging
                            meeting at relatively junior level for “size-up” purposes. You should
                            proceed on this basis. While we leave this to your judgment, are
                            inclined to think officer should not be from <persName corresp="#p_LEG1">Lansdale</persName> group or identifiably from <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. Danger obviously exists that approach is on “agent provocateur” basis
                            designed to trap us into dealings with <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> that could be publicized as recognition by US or,
                            perhaps more likely, leaked in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            circles to drive wedge between US and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. This danger is far outweighed by constructive
                            possibilities.</p>

                        <p>2. The overriding subject for discussion is Vietnam. We have at hand firm
                            military recommendations for further deployment of more than 100,000
                            additional men in 1966, and heavy pressures also for strongly
                            intensified attacks on North Vietnam. The tendency here is to accept the
                            probable necessity of additional troop deployment and to defer decisions
                            on bombing targets for the present. But we are divided on a number of
                            major tactical issues. The most urgent of these is whether a substantial
                            pause in the bombing should precede additional deployment decisions.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> tends to favor a
                            pause. Rusk and I tend to be opposed until we get some signal from
                            someone that a pause would have results in matching action by Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>3. Evidence of increasing North Vietnamese infiltration continues to come
                            in, and at the same time there is little evidence that Hanoi is ready to
                            negotiate—though there may well be heavy strains on “Liberation Front”
                            in South Vietnam. We will gradually have to make a choice between the
                            contrasting diplomatic postures recommended by <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> would continue to emphasize need for
                            negotiations. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> would
                            soft-pedal this topic as essentially irrelevant in the light of
                            continuing Hanoi intransigence.</p>
                        <p>4. A still deeper question upon which <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> has focussed attention in recent discussions is
                            the question of our underlying purpose in Vietnam. Are we seeking a
                            negotiated solution after which the superior political skill of the
                            Communists would eventually produce a Commie takeover? Or are we
                            determined to do all that is necessary to establish and sustain a
                            genuinely non-Communist South Vietnam? All three of us incline to the
                            latter position, but it is clear that its costs continue to grow, and it
                            is still more clear that only the President can decide it.</p>
                        <p>5. A substantial staff paper is going into second draft today. It deals
                            with these topics in detail and presents the choices as we now see them.
                            We hope it may lay a basis for an effective discussion with you.</p>
                        <p>6. Secondary topics are: European nuclear policy, U.S. policy at the Rio
                            conference, progress of the review of the aid program, and tactics with
                                <persName corresp="#p_SLB1">Shastri</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AKFMM1">Ayub</persName>. It does not now appear that any
                            of these will require major decisions this week, but in all of them work
                            goes forward, and there is no substitute for a clear sense of your own
                            concerns, with guidance both on the positions you want taken and the
                            questions to which you want answers.</p>
                        <p>7. I therefore recommend that a meeting be set up for either Wednesday or
                            Thursday of this week. Thursday would be a little better at this end,
                            but either day is entirely workable, depending on your convenience.</p>

                        <p>Archbishop Palmas said, “Then you would be willing to receive somebody
                            who would bring you the letter”.</p>
                        <p>I said that I did not think I should commit myself to see some junior
                            person not of the equivalent rank to me and that the letter should
                            probably be delivered to someone I would indicate. Archbishop Palmas
                            thought this was reasonable.</p>

                        <p>I said, “He is not the Viet Cong representative, is he?”</p>
                        <p>Archbishop Palmas explained, with a laugh, that he certainly was not.</p>
                        <p>He agreed to convey the message about my seeing the letter and said he
                            would get in touch with me to give me the result.</p>
                        <p>We then had a more general discussion in which he agreed with me that

                            wasting time on it. He and I agreed that it might be skullduggery

                            my interminable negotiations with Communists and might think that my
                            presence here might give a way out.</p>

                            attempts to frame the substance of the choices and to recommend a course
                            of action.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">I. Underlying Strategy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We are helping the South Vietnamese as part of our underlying strategy of
                            seeking to prevent the extension of Communist power beyond the outer
                            limits of aggression reached by the overrunning of China in 1949-50.
                            This strategy is based on the conviction that the extension of Communist
                            power by force beyond these limits could so alter the power balance as
                            to create unacceptable risks for the United States and the rest of the
                            Free World.</p>
                        <p>In pursuance of this strategy we have consistently opposed all aggressive
                            actions by—</p>
                        <p>(a) the Soviet Union (Berlin, the Cuban Missile Crisis);</p>
                        <p>(b) Communist China (Formosa, India); and</p>
                        <p>(c) smaller Communist regimes supported by both the Soviet Union and
                            Communist China (Korea, South Viet-Nam).</p>
                        <p>We have made few exceptions to this strategy:</p>
                        <p>(a) We did not intervene militarily to support French efforts to deny the
                            whole of Indochina to the Communists in 1954.</p>
                        <p>But we did (in the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Treaty and
                            subsequently) commit ourselves to assist the Government of South
                            Viet-Nam to prevent Communist aggression beyond the 17th Parallel.</p>
                        <p>(b) We have not yet put ground combat troops into Laos (although we have
                            delivered certain air strikes) because President Kennedy sought a <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536" facs="0568"/>political settlement which has
                            not yet succeeded because of non-compliance by Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>The decision you now face is whether to invest substantially more men and
                            money in South Viet-Nam and to assume the increased risks of a higher
                            level of action against North Viet-Nam. This decision must be made in
                            relation to our over-all strategy, our past commitments and the effect
                            of the decision on our relations both with our friends and
                            opponents.</p>
                        <p>This decision should be approached in light of the following
                            considerations:</p>
                        <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Such a decision must be consistent with our larger
                                strategy</hi>.</p>
                        <p>It is justified only if the United States is determined to continue that
                            strategy (pending limited settlements, as the major Communist power
                            centers become sufficiently benign and tractable). This means:</p>
                        <p>(1) That we will continue to play an active role in Western Europe and
                            maintain the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defenses;</p>
                        <p>(2) That we will continue building the strength, and encouraging the
                            anti-Communist will, of the countries on the southern and western
                            frontiers of China.</p>
                        <p>(a) Japan-Formosa-Korea;</p>
                        <p>(b) India-Pakistan;</p>
                        <p>(c) Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>B. <hi rend="italic">The decision must be made in relation to all that
                                has gone before</hi>.</p>
                        <p>We have made commitments to South Viet-Nam. We have taken losses of men
                            and money. We have accepted substantial political costs. To quit now
                            would mean a major loss of prestige and would undermine the credibility
                            of our commitments elsewhere in the world.</p>
                        <p>C. <hi rend="italic">In deciding our actions in Viet-Nam we should—so far
                                as possible—avoid those acts that exacerbate relations with
                                countries friendly to the United States.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>D. <hi rend="italic">We should also—to the greatest extent possible—avoid
                                actions that might enlarge the war by involving either China or the

                        </p>
                        <p>In planning our air offensive against North Viet-Nam, we should,
                            therefore, be quite clear as to the possible effects of particular types
                            of attack. We should avoid actions likely to provoke Chinese reactions,
                            since it is explicitly not our purpose to seek to create a pretext for
                            the destruction of Chinese war-making power. We should instead
                            concentrate on those actions designed:</p>
                        <p>(1) To impede the supply of men and equipment to South Viet-Nam; and</p>

                            on a basis more advantageous to South Viet-Nam than a mere ratification

                        <p>The massive infusions of United States ideas, aid and manpower have
                            frustrated any Communist design to move into their conventional-warfare
                            “Stage III,” but the guerrilla war continues at a high pace, inflation
                            in South Viet-Nam is becoming increasingly serious, and the internal
                            political situation remains fragile.</p>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">Military</hi>. The large United States deployments
                            have thwarted the Viet Cong monsoon offensive designed to impose a major
                            defeat on the Government forces. The “Phase I” deployments, 160,000 of
                            whom are already in place, have enabled the government forces to begin
                            restoration of their strength, morale and tactical integrity, which is
                            essential if they are to retain their fighting capability in the months
                            ahead. The United States forces have also substantially secured their
                            own bases and the areas immediately adjacent to the bases (see Map 1,
                                attached).<note n="2" xml:id="d194fn2">Not found. </note> United

                            strikes—to probe into Viet Cong base sanctuaries that had long been
                            untouched. The United States forces have also proved to be an effective
                            quick-reaction reserve for Government forces and have turned potential

                            battalion strength in Hau Nghia province and against the Marine
                            perimeter outside Danang. There are increased casualties on both sides.
                            Viet Cong attacks, terrorism and sabotage show no sign of abating.
                            Desertions from Government forces remain high, but recruitment has
                            improved, permitting a gradual increase in force levels. On the other
                            side, defections from the Viet Cong are running at 1,000 a month and are
                            increasing slowly.</p>
                        <p>The present assessment is that our Phase I deployments (bringing the
                            United States total to about 210,000 to 225,000 men) when completed will
                            achieve the limit of its military potential between December 1965 and
                            March 1966. Assuming, as we in prudence must, that the Viet Cong are
                            able to maintain the strength and morale of their forces, the military
                            estimate illustrated by Map 1 is that Phase I forces, working with the
                            South Vietnamese, will result in “control” of 40 percent of the
                            population and 5-10 percent of the area; these forces will keep open
                            20-25 percent of <pb n="538" xml:id="pg_538" facs="0570"/>the critical
                            lines of communication; these forces will permit 10-20 percent
                            disruption of the Viet Cong's political/security infrastructure.</p>
                        <p>We will then be in a position where a few enclaves, including perhaps
                            5,500,000 of South Viet-Nam's 15,000,000 people (of which only some
                            1,000,000 are in the Delta) are under United States or Government
                            “control”—and even these will, of course, be subject to sporadic Viet
                            Cong mortar and suicide satchel-charge attacks of the October 27
                                kind.<note n="3" xml:id="d194fn3">See <ref target="#d189fn4">footnote 4, Document 189</ref>.</note> Security conditions
                            within the enclaves will be suitable for reconstruction of political
                            infrastructure, but it is probable that the enclaves will be too small
                            and the percent of population controlled too little to give any hope
                            that such pacification will be rapid or that it will tend to snowball
                            beyond the enclaves.</p>
                        <p>The capabilities and intentions of the Viet Cong and of the North
                            Vietnamese are unknowns complicating our estimate of the situation at
                            this time. There are signs that Viet Cong morale is sagging. But, even
                            when confronted by the United States force build-up and by our program
                            of actions against North Viet-Nam—and with increasing casualties and
                            weapons losses—the Viet Cong have demonstrated an ability to continue
                            the build-up and supply of their forces in the South. The build-up is
                            continuing both from in-country sources and by infiltration over
                            improved roads in Laos and, to a lesser extent, by sea via Cambodia. The
                            indications are that the Viet Cong are not reverting to a lesser level
                            of insurgency, but are still striving to build up for the transition to
                            conventional warfare—that they are continuing both to upgrade guerrilla
                            units in the Delta and to infiltrate additional regular army elements
                            from the North in order to restore the balance temporarily upset by
                            United States deployments.</p>
                        <p>(The other factor difficult to estimate in the situation is the degree to
                            which improved morale among the South Vietnamese will be reflected in
                            more effective military operations and governmental performance as well
                            as in resistance of the local population to cooperation with the Viet
                            Cong.)</p>
                        <p>The Viet Cong forces are now estimated at 71,300 “main force and
                            logistic,” 40,000 political cadre, and 110,000 guerrillas. This
                            represents an increase in our estimate since early last summer of some
                            6,000 (9%), 10,000 (33-1/3%) and 18,200 (20%) in the three categories
                            respectively. In addition—although as of last month there were estimated
                            to be three regiments of North Vietnamese regular forces in the
                            South—early this month two additional North Vietnamese regiments were
                            confirmed and three others were estimated as possible. In total,
                            therefore, the Communist forces are now believed to number about 230,000
                            men, and there is reason to believe that they will continue to
                            increase.</p>

                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Political.</hi> In Saigon, the <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> “government of generals” has
                            survived, but accomplished little more during the period since last
                            summer. The Government, while recognizing many of its problems and
                            working willingly with the United States Mission, still lacks any broad,
                            or even developing, base of support among the various political
                            factions. No major faction (e.g., Buddhists, Catholics) is in open
                            opposition, and all appear to be continuing their “wait and see”
                            attitude. This lack of support probably will not be important over the
                            short-run, so long as the generals in power remain united; over the
                            longer term, however, some base of political support must be developed
                            if the non-Communist elements in South Viet-Nam are ever to build a
                            viable society. While we are doing all possible to facilitate and
                            encourage the development of such a political base, this is a long-term
                            process. It reaches into the roots of Vietnamese society and psychology
                            and is not subject to quick solution by any measures within our power.
                            The only encouraging factor in the situation is that responsible
                            Vietnamese seem to be increasingly concerned with the problem.</p>
                        <p>In the countryside, the Government's political situation is even worse
                            than in Saigon and other urban centers. The Viet Cong have savagely
                            destroyed most of the political structure of the rural areas. The
                            potential leaders who could form the nucleus of counter-Viet Cong
                            efforts in each locale have been killed, intimidated or driven out,
                            leaving the old, weak and incompetent behind. Absent security (and where
                            there is security, absent willing and able leadership), rural
                            reconstruction (pacification) continues to make little, if any progress.
                            The very difficult problem of getting pacification moving has not been
                            solved.</p>
                        <p>c. <hi rend="italic">Economic.</hi> South Viet-Nam's economic situation
                            today is grave for two reasons:</p>
                        <p>(1) The Communist strategy has been to draw on the Vietnamese economy to
                            support the Viet Cong's own operations and to withhold the remainder
                            from the Government and from those of the people who support it. Thus,
                            in large part as a consequence of Viet Cong operations, Viet-Nam has
                            become a food-import area; commodities cannot move freely within the
                            country (e.g., rice from the Delta to Saigon), and the Viet Cong are in
                            a position to derive much of their own needs (e.g., construction
                            material, food, medical supplies) from within the South Vietnamese
                            economy.</p>
                        <p>(2) The rapid and large United States/South Viet-Nam force build-up has
                            introduced a new and strenuous competition for Viet-Nam's human and
                            material resources. When added to the Viet Cong economic warfare
                            efforts, the build-up has resulted in a growing inflation in the
                            Vietnamese economy.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">III. Acceptable Settlement Objectives.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Our basic objective is the restoration of a South Viet-Nam “free to
                            determine its own future without external interference.”</p>
                        <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540" facs="0572"/>
                        <p>We are proceeding on the assumption that South Viet-Nam can eventually be
                            made into a workable and reasonably stable non-Communist nation, which,
                            under the right conditions, could cope with the powerful Communist-led
                            apparatus that is now the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>We recognize the possibility—at the end of the road—of North and South
                            Viet-Nam freely deciding the issue of reunification.</p>
                        <p>In concrete terms—and roughly in the order they might be approached—the
                            conditions precedent to the attainment of our objective—whether worked
                            out through new formal negotiations or resulting from tacit
                            arrangements—are:</p>
                        <p>A. A cessation of infiltration of men and arms, and an end to leadership
                            ties (represented concretely by radio communications) with the
                            North.</p>
                        <p>B. Cessation or sharp reduction in military actions and terrorism in the
                            South.</p>
                        <p>C. Withdrawal to the North of the maximum possible number of those who
                            continue to accept Hanoi discipline.</p>
                        <p>This means particularly post-1954 North Vietnamese citizens (whether
                            Northern or Southern born). In practice this group breaks down into
                            readily identifiable North Vietnamese regular units and individuals born
                            in North Viet-Nam, and the much less readily identifiable “regroupees”
                            or “returnees” who are of Southern origin and who formed the bulk of the
                            infiltration up to early 1964.</p>
                        <p>D. Cessation of United States/South Vietnamese bombing attacks on the
                            North.</p>
                        <p>We have said we would do this in return for some combination of A through

                        <p>The South Vietnamese have spoken of the use of “established democratic
                            processes,” by which they clearly mean a gradual and controlled
                            extension of indirect representation methods, perhaps based on
                            progressive local elections, subject at every point to security
                            considerations and controls.</p>
                        <p>Hanoi's present position calls for the National Liberation Front taking
                            over through the device of a coalition (without elections).</p>
                        <p>The United States has categorically rejected Hanoi's position and would
                            equally oppose the National Liberation Front/Viet Cong remaining intact
                            under any name as a legal political organization. But we have left the
                            door open to amnesty and non-reprisal treatment for any individuals now
                            in the Viet Cong who lay down their arms and accept Government rule.</p>

                            situation in which the Viet Cong were able to maintain themselves in key
                            areas they now control. (Hence the danger of the terms “cease-fire” and

                        <p>On this point we and Hanoi are not far apart—verbally. Hanoi adds
                            “pending reunification,” but this need not be serious. However, the
                            substance of this is what the war is about.</p>

                        <p>We have not tried to spell this out, partly because we do not want to get
                            drawn into any acceptance of international supervision of the political
                            structure in the South. (Such supervision could well favor the Viet

                            thus “neutral” in this sense. But the South Vietnamese insist that they
                            must retain the sovereign right to call for outside help if they need
                            it, and we would insist on this too unless there were equivalent and
                            really effective international, multilateral guarantees and policing

                        <p>We have said we would accept this when the South is truly free to run its
                            affairs without interference, i.e., when at least points A through F are
                            resolved satisfactorily. In this sense we agree verbally with Hanoi on
                            the eventual status. However, Hanoi occasionally says our withdrawal
                            must precede any negotiations (we don't believe they mean this), and
                            would in any event seek to get American forces out much sooner and with
                            concomitant performance on their side being limited to the withdrawal of
                            only their own regulars. We would probably seek to retain military
                            advisors, and in any case would expect to maintain economic assistance,
                            which would be badly needed for a long time.</p>

                        <p>K. Provisions for possible reunification.</p>
                        <p>We have taken our stand squarely on the principle of ultimate free
                            determination under international supervision, but have said nothing on
                            timing. Hanoi does not mention free elections, but appears content to
                            let the issue be handled later, doubtless expecting that they will
                            succeed in establishing a Communist-oriented government in the South
                            that would move toward reunification in due course. At this stage they
                            also may not wish to offend Southern sentiment—even in the Viet Cong—by
                            making their ambitions nakedly clear. The South Vietnamese are generally
                            willing to accept an indefinite division of the country.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">IV. Practical Elements of Achieving Settlement.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>While the above analysis indicates the ultimate complexity of a
                            settlement—whether through negotiation or withering away—in practice, we
                            do not have to cross all these bridges now. What we really need to focus
                            on is the kind of factual situation in the South that would, over time,
                            give us the best chance that a stable non-Communist South Viet-Nam would
                            emerge.</p>
                        <p>From the standpoint of our public posture and any communications we may
                            have with Hanoi on any channel, we need to focus on five areas where we
                            could be “hard, “less hard but still acceptable”, or “soft” in ways that
                            would affect the chances of a favorable non-Communist outcome. It would
                            be convenient if we could stay absolutely firm on conditions that would
                            assure a 100% chance over the long run of a non-Communist outcome. In
                            fact, there can never be such absolute assurance. And, in assessing
                            whether to keep up the military pressure in the hope of achieving an
                            ideal result we must weigh the scale of conflict this might involve and
                            the intangible, but perhaps crucial, effect of our continued massive
                            presence on a future healthy South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>The patient has got to learn to walk some time, and attempted total
                            eradication of his Communist disease may be worse for his recovery than
                            throwing him more on his own—with some degree of risk—as soon as the
                            chances look reasonably good.</p>
                        <p>The five areas we need to focus on are:</p>
                        <p>1. What to accept in return for cessation of bombing of the North.</p>
                        <p>We should rule out even a limited pause if the quid pro quo were only the
                            initiation of negotiations. Bombing is our only bargaining counter that
                            offers hope of an agreement that does more than ratify the situation on
                            the ground in South Viet-Nam and the balance of forces there. It is,
                            therefore, important that we carefully preserve it and play the card of
                            cessation of bombing only at the optimum point in any type of
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <pb n="543" xml:id="pg_543" facs="0575"/>
                        <p>2. What degree of withdrawal of Hanoi-directed elements.</p>
                        <p>Our initial position must be that of the South Vietnamese Government—that
                            they all be withdrawn. We should maintain this position inflexibly as to
                            Northerners and also as to identified Southern-born military and
                            political leaders. At the same time we must recognize that it would not
                            be practicable to try to weed out every last man of the 45,000 estimated
                            to have infiltrated—or to attempt to deport to the North all the Viet
                            Cong, whether they come from the North or not. In carrying out any final
                            agreement it would be necessary to apply a practicability test to the
                            former, and to let some of the latter stay.</p>
                        <p>3. What political status in the South for individuals now in the Viet
                            Cong.</p>
                        <p>The Geneva Accords—which we are seeking to revive—contain a non-reprisal
                            provision. We do not wish such a provision to be policed by an
                            international body, and we certainly cannot accept the National
                            Liberation Front as a legal political entity. But a full-scale amnesty
                            program—now at best limping along—would be most useful even while the
                            conflict continues. It might be extended, as the Acheson Plan suggests,
                            to allow political participation, under Government control at all
                            stages, of Viet Cong individuals who had laid aside their arms.</p>
                        <p>4. How complete a roll-up of the Viet Cong military forces.</p>
                        <p>Although there should certainly be no legalized safe havens, and we must
                            insist that the Government's police power have the right to operate
                            throughout the country, we could in practice settle—as Ambassador Lodge
                            has suggested—for some hard-core Viet Cong remnants off in the
                            hills.</p>
                        <p>5. What timing for United States withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>This depends on too many variables for us to take any sure position now.
                            If, as suggested above, we settled for less than total withdrawal of the
                            infiltrators, it would give us the basis to keep some of our forces for
                            a long time if we desired to do so.</p>
                        <p>The above analysis indicates areas where we could show some “give” at the
                            right time and still have as good a chance as we could expect of the
                            final favorable outcome. But it also identifies “soft” positions that,
                            if taken, would so greatly prejudice the chances of attaining our
                            objectives that we should not accept them unless and until we decide
                            that the problem is not manageable.</p>
                        <p>Among these are: (a) stopping bombings in return merely for initiation of
                            negotiations, without more concrete action; (b) accepting the National
                            Liberation Front as a valid political entity; (c) legalized Viet Cong
                            safe havens; (d) United States withdrawal on any firm timetable
                            unrelated to other elements.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The interacting tools available to us in working toward a solution to the
                            problem in South Viet-Nam are:</p>
                        <p>(a) Military power in South Viet-Nam, Laos and in the adjacent
                            waters;</p>
                        <p>(b) Military interdiction in, and pressure on, North Viet-Nam;</p>
                        <p>(c) Political, economic and psychological efforts in South Viet-Nam;
                            and</p>
                        <p>(d) Political and diplomatic pressures on Hanoi and Peiping.</p>
                        <p>Military variables.</p>
                        <p>The military variables are (1) a pause, (2) Rolling Thunder, and (3) the
                            deployment of additional forces:</p>
                        <p>1. Pause—An interruption in the program of bombing North Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>It has been suggested that we have a pause that would stand down all
                            strikes and armed reconnaissance in North Viet-Nam for approximately
                            four weeks unless its futility became apparent earlier. It would not
                            involve stoppage of other reconnaissance or intelligence operations in
                            North Viet-Nam or of any operations elsewhere. Ground and air operations
                            in South Viet-Nam would continue. The pause would be publicly
                            acknowledged, but a serious effort would be made to avoid advertising it
                            as an ultimatum to North Viet-Nam. Third countries would be encouraged
                            to use the pause to help produce negotiations for an acceptable
                            settlement. With respect to termination of the pause, our state of mind
                            would be (a)“hard-line” or (b) “soft-line”:</p>
                        <p>(a) “Hard-line” Pause.</p>
                        <p>Under a “hard-line” pause, we would be firmly resolved to resume bombing
                            unless the Communists were clearly moving toward what is described above
                            as an acceptable settlement.</p>
                        <p>(b) “Soft-line” Pause.</p>
                        <p>Under a “soft-line” pause, we would be willing to feel our way with
                            respect to termination of the pause, with less insistence on concrete
                            concessions by the Communists. (This kind of pause makes sense only if
                            we are working toward something much less than what has been described
                            above as an acceptable settlement.)</p>
                        <p>2. Rolling Thunder and armed reconnaissance.</p>
                        <p>This program (a) could be intensified abruptly by a sharp heavy blow, as
                            recommended by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, (b) could continue to increase
                            at the present pace, or (c) could be maintained at approximately its
                            present level.</p>
                        <p>(a) <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> “sharp blow.”</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> would initiate immediately, and
                            carry out in a few days a program of air strikes against</p>
                        <pb n="545" xml:id="pg_545" facs="0577"/>
                        <p>—Phuc Yen, Hanoi/Gia Lam, Hanoi/Bac Mai, Haiphong/Cat Bi, and
                            Haiphong/Kien An airfields, including the aircraft thereon (Phuc Yen to
                            be struck by B-52s).</p>
                        <p>—Rail, highway and waterway routes and traffic between Hanoi and Haiphong
                            and between Hanoi-Haiphong and South China.</p>
                        <p>—Petroleum storage facilities at Haiphong (or four thermal power plants
                            generating approximately 50% of North Viet-Nam's thermal power).</p>
                        <p>—<gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> installations and other
                            anti-aircraft defenses which pose a threat to the above air
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>The Joint Chiefs would permit normal armed reconnaissance in all of North
                            Viet-Nam, and would order follow-on strikes as necessary to keep the
                            targets destroyed. They would conduct naval surface force operations
                            against targets near the coast and against North Vietnamese shipping at
                            sea. They would mine the harbors. Every effort would be made to minimize
                            destruction of non-military installations; and the civilian populations,
                            as such, would not be targeted.</p>
                        <p>(b) Extrapolation of Rolling Thunder Program.</p>
                        <p>Up to this point we have been conducting the Rolling Thunder program on
                            the assumption that our air attacks against North Viet-Nam would become
                            progressively more severe, both with respect to intensity and geography.
                            At the present time, we are carrying out 600 armed reconnaissance
                            sorties a week in the “three quadrants” and striking two fixed
                            lines-of-communication (<gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>) targets a
                            week in the “northeast quadrant” (but not against targets in the “China
                            strip,” the Hanoi circle,” or the “Haiphong circle”). If we should
                            continue this progressively intensifying program over a five-month
                            period, we would maintain activity in the three quadrants at the present
                            level. The program might, however, evolve in the “northeast quadrant”
                            along the following illustrative pattern:</p>
                        <p>—1st month. Include Hanoi-Haiphong <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>
                            targets (outside the Hanoi and Haiphong circles), with two fixed <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> targets in the quadrant each week.</p>
                        <p>—2nd and 3rd months. No fixed targets in the quadrant, but “controlled
                            armed reconnaissance” of selected routes at selected times and at the
                            rate of 100 sorties a week.</p>
                        <p>—4th month. EXTEND “controlled armed reconnaissance” to <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>s within the Hanoi and Haiphong circles
                            and ADD strikes on three key petroleum installation targets a month.</p>
                        <p>—5th month. In the first two weeks, ADD mining of Haiphong Harbor;
                            thereafter, change the armed reconnaissance in the northeast quadrant to
                            the kind carried out in the other three quadrants and with no
                            geographical limit except the strip next to China. (Left unstruck would
                            be population targets, power plants, and locks and dams.)</p>
                        <p>(c) Maintenance at present level.</p>
                        <p>This would involve continuing a level of armed reconnaissance sorties
                            throughout North Viet-Nam adequate to keep military installations <pb n="546" xml:id="pg_546" facs="0578"/>and the line of communication
                            to the south as fully out of action as possible, and to maintain a
                            limited pattern of fixed strikes in the “northeast quadrant”. It might
                            involve elements of the extrapolated program such as strikes on the
                            Hanoi-Haiphong line of communication targets (out-side the circles). And
                            it might be extended in a small way to the “controlled armed
                            reconnaissance” in the northeast quadrant designed to keep these major
                            lines of communication under continuing harassment and interruption.</p>
                        <p>While the present level of 600 armed reconnaissance sorties a week would
                            remain a rough benchmark, we would need to consider in any case whether
                            the growing evidence of expanded lines of communication in Laos may
                            warrant some diversion of effort to that area. We should also consider
                            getting a much more pronounced daily and weekly variation into the total
                            pattern of air activity over the North, so that the rate of sorties
                            varies greatly. This varied pattern would have merit under any program,
                            but it would be particularly applicable to a “continuing” level in that
                            it would keep Hanoi guessing and minimize any implication that we had
                            settled down without an increase.</p>
                        <p>The argument for maintaining bombing at the present level is that no
                            feasible amount of bombing of the North is going to achieve an
                            acceptable settlement in the absence of a substantial improvement in the
                            situation on the ground in the South. Therefore, a substantial increase
                            in bombing of the North will have a maximum “climactic” effect if
                            carried out at a time when the situation in the South is more clearly
                            moving in our favor. It would also continue to maintain the Haiphong
                            Harbor and petroleum storage as “hostage” for the now very vulnerable
                            port and petroleum storage at Saigon.</p>
                        <p>3. Additional (Phase II) Deployments.</p>
                        <p>United States force deployments (I) could stop at the presently approved
                            225,000 # during 1966.</p>
                        <p>(a) Stop at Phase I. Limit United States forces to the presently approved
                            225,000. Added expenditures attributable to Phase I, through FY 1967,
                            are estimated to be $13 billion.</p>
                        <p>(b) Deploy additional Phase II forces. Deploy 28 additional combat
                            battalions and four additional tactical air squadrons and associated
                            support forces (125,000 additional men), bringing the totals to 62
                            United States combat battalions (plus 10 third-country battalions) and
                            26 United States tactical air squadrons, or approximately 350,000
                            Americans in South Viet-Nam. These deployments would be essentially
                            completed by the end of 1966, and would be—as proposed by <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>—at a considerably slower rate than
                            the August-December 1965 rate, specifically at the <pb n="547" xml:id="pg_547" facs="0579"/>rate of six, seven, nine and six ground
                            combat battalions for each of the four quarters of 1966.</p>
                        <p>These deployments could be accomplished without calling up the reserves
                            or extending tours of duty, but, in that case, they would lead to
                            further reductions in the strength of our strategic reserve to meet
                            contingencies elsewhere. (An alternative would be to call up
                            reserves—not only replenishing the strategic reserves, but also giving a
                            clear demonstration of United States power and purposes.) Expenditures
                            attributable to Phase II for its first 18 months are estimated very
                            roughly at $3 billion. It is estimated—as can be seen on Map II<note n="6" xml:id="d194fn6">Not found.</note>—that, by the time Phase II
                            forces are making their full impact in the spring of 1967, the United
                            States/South Vietnamese forces would have “control” of 65 percent of the
                            population and 20-30 percent of the land; 60-65 percent of the critical
                            lines of communications would be kept open; 40-50 percent of the Viet
                            Cong bases and military logistical infrastructure would be subject to
                            disruption; and 30 percent of the Viet Cong political/security
                            infrastructure would be disrupted.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted that the <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>-proposed Phase II does not allocate any forces to the
                            Delta. To handle the Delta properly, Phase II would have to be augmented
                            by one or two additional divisions—30,000 to 60,000 additional
                            men—bringing the Phase II total to 155,000 to 185,000 men, or an overall
                            total of between 380,000 and 410,000 men in South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">VI. Alternative Courses of Action.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A theoretical case can be made for a course of action such as a “soft
                            line” pause, extreme negotiating efforts and—following the
                            pause—maintenance of present force levels in the South and the present
                            level of Rolling Thunder attacks in the North, all designed to feel our
                            way toward a “compromise outcome”. We all believe, however, that such a
                            course of action would not support our basic strategy. It would end up
                            in disintegration in Viet-Nam, in political humiliation for the United
                            States, and impaired American political effectiveness on the world
                            scene. It could also lead to more costly confrontations with the Chinese
                            Communists later on. In essence, it simply is not consistent with the
                            definition given above of what would constitute an acceptable
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>Thus, the realistic choices boil down to:</p>
                        <p>First Course: No Pause, With Continuing or Evolving Rolling Thunder and
                            With No Substantial Further Deployments to South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>This course of action can be supported in this way:</p>
                        <p>(a) It will be January before the weight of our full presently-approved
                            deployments really comes into play. By then we might see at least <pb n="548" xml:id="pg_548" facs="0580"/>an adverse morale trend in the
                            Viet Cong that would indicate we were getting somewhere.</p>
                        <p>(b) It may be useful to give ourselves time to digest the impact of
                            225,000 men in terms of their effect on the Vietnamese psychology and
                            economy. This is a factor that some reports, notably a recent cable from
                            Saigon on inflationary and labor division problems, suggest may be
                            becoming very serious even to the point of being a limiting factor on
                            our basic effectiveness in appealing to the people.</p>
                        <p>(c) It would give the Government of Viet-Nam additional time, hopefully
                            without serious frictions with us, to get on with its part of the job
                            and to build up a South Vietnamese contribution that would not be
                            dwarfed by the United States role.</p>
                        <p>On the drawback side are two factors:</p>
                        <p>(a) Deferring additional United States deployments—particularly in the
                            face of continuing increases in Viet Cong strength—raises grave problems
                            in our domestic situation. This is not solely a question of the war
                            dragging on—which, one can argue, it would be likely to do even with
                            additional deployments—but rather a question of not having clearly done
                            all on the ground in Viet-Nam that appears wise. It would be still more
                            serious, of course, if the rate of progress slowed down, as is likely to
                            be the case.</p>
                        <p>(b)The second drawback is that, by delaying the added deployments, we
                            should lose momentum in Viet-Nam—a momentum that reflects a
                            determination and confidence crucial to the psychology of the
                            confrontation.</p>
                        <p>Basically, this course can continue to assure against a Viet Cong
                            “victory” as long as our relations with the Vietnamese government and
                            people remain good; it can, as indicated above, result in an indefinite
                            stalemate if Hanoi and the Viet Cong can maintain the morale and
                            strength of their forces. It presents the least danger of overt Chinese
                            Communist or Soviet intervention. The two important variables difficult
                            to predict are the morale on the South Vietnamese side (and
                            correspondingly our relations with them) and the morale on the
                            Hanoi-Viet Cong side. Morale has unquestionably improved in South
                            Viet-Nam and we are beginning to see a few small signs of deterioration
                            in morale among the Viet Cong. These hopeful trends may be expected to
                            continue for the time being as the forces we are now deploying there
                            move toward full effectiveness. Their indefinite continuation might
                            result in an acceptable settlement at some time in the foreseeable
                            future even though the balance of military force were not such as to
                            assure a military destruction of the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>But it is not possible to be certain that these trends will continue
                            indefinitely. If there were a stalemate, or only very slow progress,
                            there would—sooner or later—be a tendency for South Vietnamese morale to
                                <pb n="549" xml:id="pg_549" facs="0581"/>sag and frustrations to
                            focus on the American presence and the problems associated with that
                            presence. On the Viet Cong-Hanoi side, the continued infusion of North
                            Vietnamese forces may serve somewhat to offset the many factors
                            unfavorable to them.</p>
                        <p>This development would not be overcome merely by intensified bombing of
                            the North. We have always thought such bombing would bring Hanoi to an
                            acceptable settlement only if the tide were clearly running against them
                            in the South. If the prediction of probable stalemate above held true,
                            in the absence of additional deployments, even the extrapolated Rolling
                            Thunder program would be unlikely to bring Hanoi around.</p>
                        <p>In sum, this course of action does not appear hopeful.</p>
                        <p>Second Course: Pause, Extrapolated Rolling Thunder, and Additional
                            Deployments.</p>
                        <p>In view of the intensified actions involved, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> would not recommend this
                            course of action unless it were preceded by a “hard-line pause”, as set
                            forth in Paragraph V 1. (a) above.</p>
                        <p>The purposes of—and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s arguments for—such a pause are four:</p>
                        <p>(a) It would offer Hanoi and the Viet Cong a chance to move toward a
                            solution if they should be so inclined, removing the psychological
                            barrier of continued bombing and permitting the Soviets and others to
                            bring moderating arguments to bear;</p>
                        <p>(b) It would demonstrate to domestic and international critics that we
                            had indeed made every effort for a peaceful settlement before proceeding
                            to intensified actions, notably the latter stages of the extrapolated
                            Rolling Thunder program;</p>
                        <p>(c) It would probably tend to reduce the dangers of escalation after we
                            had resumed the bombing, at least insofar as the Soviets were
                            concerned;</p>
                        <p>(d) It would set the stage for another pause, perhaps in late 1966, which
                            might produce a settlement.</p>
                        <p>Against these propositions, there are the following considerations
                            arguing against a pause:</p>
                        <p>(a) In the absence of any indication from Hanoi as to what reciprocal
                            action it might take, we could well find ourselves in the position of
                            having played this very important card without receiving anything
                            substantial in return. There are no indications that Hanoi is yet in a
                            mood to agree to a settlement acceptable to us. The chance is,
                            therefore, very slight that a pause at this time could lead to an
                            acceptable settlement.</p>
                        <p>(b) A unilateral pause at this time would offer an excellent opportunity
                            for Hanoi to interpose obstacles to our resumption of bombing and to
                            demoralize South Viet-Nam by indefinitely dangling before us (and <pb n="550" xml:id="pg_550" facs="0582"/>the world) the prospect of
                            negotiations with no intent of reaching an acceptable settlement. It
                            might also tempt the Soviet Union to make threats that would render very
                            difficult a decision to resume bombing.</p>
                        <p>(c) In Saigon, obtaining South Vietnamese acquiescence to a pause would
                            be difficult. It could adversely affect the Government's solidity. Any
                            major falling out between the Government and the United States, or any
                            overturn in the Government's political structure, could set us back very
                            severely.</p>
                        <p>(d) An additional factor is that undertaking the second course of action
                            following a pause would give this course a much more dramatic character,
                            both internationally and domestically, and would, in particular, present
                            the Soviets with those difficult choices that we have hereto-fore been
                            successful in avoiding.</p>
                        <p>On balance, the arguments against the pause are convincing to the
                            Secretary of State, who recommends that it not be undertaken at the
                            present time. The Secretary of State believes that a pause should be
                            undertaken only when and if the chances were significantly greater than
                            they now appear that Hanoi would respond by reciprocal actions leading
                            in the direction of a peaceful settlement. He further believes that,
                            from the standpoint of international and domestic opinion, a pause might
                            become an overriding requirement only if we were about to reach the
                            advanced stages of an extrapolated Rolling Thunder program involving
                            extensive air operations in the Hanoi/Haiphong area. Since the Secretary
                            of State believes that such advanced stages are not in themselves
                            desirable until the tide in the South is more favorable, he does not
                            feel that even accepting the point of view of the Secretary of Defense,
                            there is now any international requirement to consider a “Pause”.</p>
                        <p>Third Course: No Pause, Continuing Rolling Thunder at Present Levels, and
                            Gradual Phase II Deployments.</p>
                        <p>This course of action would, like all of those considered, also include
                            maximum diplomatic efforts to explore and exploit all possibilities of
                            achieving an acceptable settlement.</p>
                        <p>The principal element in this Third Course would be to increase our
                            ground deployments on the basis of a progressive evaluation of need and
                            effectiveness, but to avoid any dramatic decision to the maximum extent
                            possible. This would involve immediate preparations for additional
                            deployments to the South along Phase II lines during 1966. It would
                            almost certainly mean a final decision in early January to carry out
                            first and second quarter Phase II deployments (six and seven combat
                            battalions respectively). Such further deployments would be presented,
                            not as a new “phase” but as the carrying out of your often repeated
                            statement that “we are going to do what we need to do.”</p>
                        <pb n="551" xml:id="pg_551" facs="0583"/>
                        <p>Preparations would also go forward for third and fourth quarter Phase II
                            deployments, but final decision would not be made until late spring.</p>
                        <p>(Both the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State agree that at
                            the present time and under present conditions the risks resulting from
                            the reduction in our ready reserve that will result from such additional
                            deployments are acceptable.)</p>
                        <p>Under this course of action the Rolling Thunder program would be
                            conducted on the “continuing” basis defined in Paragraph V 2. (c) but
                            leaving open the option of moving to the extrapolated program if Hanoi
                            appeared to be weakening. Likewise, a pause would be deferred, but might
                            later be considered if Hanoi appeared to be weakening.</p>
                        <p>Essentially, this course of action is designed to maintain momentum in
                            the South so that South Vietnamese morale and performance can be
                            improved. In essence, it is designed to “play for the breaks” (as we did
                            in the Berlin blockade and Korea) without actions that would bring the
                            situation prematurely to a head.</p>
                        <p>From a strictly military standpoint, even the full carrying out of Phase
                            II deployments during 1966 would not extend the areas of government
                            control or weaken the Viet Cong structure decisively. (See Map II.) The
                            major variables would continue to be whether the South Vietnamese
                            Government achieves effectiveness—and above all whether Viet Cong morale
                            cracks significantly.</p>
                        <p>We cannot say that the chances are better than even that this would
                            happen by the end of 1966, but at least we would be keeping the pressure
                            on and giving ourselves every reasonable chance of getting this decisive
                            “break”.</p>
                        <p>As between the Second and Third Courses, the Second Course may offer
                            us—if it were to work out favorably—a somewhat greater chance of an
                            acceptable outcome by the end of 1966. On the other hand, with the
                            political dangers of an immediate pause, and the uncertainty and
                            possible widening of the war involved in the latter stage of the
                            extrapolated Rolling Thunder program, the Second Course would also
                            involve significantly greater chances of either an adverse development
                            in the South or a wider war.</p>
                        <p>The Third Course would give us every reasonable chance of moving ahead in
                            the South before we had to take the critical and difficult actions
                            involved in a pause and a substantially intensified Rolling Thunder
                            program. It would clearly be slower, but it might in the end be surer,
                            particularly in light of the time needed to develop a more solid and
                            effective political structure in the South.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Neither the third nor any of the other courses of action considered in
                            this memorandum could give positive assurance of success. The North
                            Vietnamese probably could, by additional deployments, match our
                            deployments on a 1-for-3 or 1-for-4 basis, thus effectively cancelling
                            the likelihood that the additional forces set forth in this memorandum
                            would be able to provide security to areas beyond the enclaves shown on
                            the attached maps. If the Hanoi authorities should do this, we could
                            find ourselves in a position where—with our killed-in-action casualties
                            at 500 to 800 per month—the pressures would be great to invade or to
                            bomb the cities in the North—actions which would be likely to lead to a
                            severe reaction from China and possibly from the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>The Viet Cong can be expected to continue their “Phase II” sabotage,
                            murder and guerrilla activities, while continuing to strive to build up
                            a conventional military capability. They will depend more and more on
                            regular <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> forces; they will draw
                            harder on the men and material in the areas they control, including the
                            Delta; and they can be expected to try to bring the economy of South
                            Viet-Nam to a grinding halt. The question, of course, is whether the
                            pressure on the North and the added forces in the South can frustrate
                            these Viet Cong designs. The question also is whether Hanoi will
                            continue to have the will and the morale to carry this on.</p>
                        <p>If Hanoi and the Viet Cong are successful in their efforts to stand firm,
                            we may be faced in late 1966 or early 1967 with critical decisions. One
                            possibility which needs further analysis would be military action to
                            “seal off” an infiltration corridor in Laos to a “barrier” just south of
                            the 17th Parallel from the sea to Thailand. Such a “barrier” would
                            require major military forces, including Thai and Laos forces on the
                            West end and Vietnamese and United States forces on the East end. It
                            would create major political problems in Laos, particularly in terms of
                            obtaining the support of Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma, and major
                            international complications in that it would be an open breach of the
                            Laos settlement.</p>
                        <p>Another, and perhaps more likely, possibility would be the requirement
                            for still additional deployments of American forces in the South.
                            Finally, there would of course be the pressures mentioned above to
                            invade or bomb the cities in the North, with the risks that would flow
                            therefrom, as well as to mine Haiphong Harbor.</p>
                        <p>(Any consideration of the mining of Haiphong Harbor will, among other
                            considerations, have to consider its effects on and our interests in the
                            relative positions of Moscow and Peiping influence in Hanoi.)</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Regardless of which of the possible courses outlined above is adopted,
                            maximum effort must be given now and for an extended period to the
                            political, economic and psychological efforts without which South <pb n="553" xml:id="pg_553" facs="0585"/>Viet-Nam will never be made
                            into a workable and reasonably stable non-Communist nation able to cope
                            with the Viet Cong apparatus. In a sense, our military effort, however
                            essential, is buying us time in which to work with the Vietnamese to
                            build a political, economic and social base among the bulk of the people
                            and primarily the rural people who make up 80 percent of the
                            population.</p>
                        <p>The following are the principal elements in our present program:</p>
                        <p>(1) Do what we can to develop out of the present Government of Viet-Nam
                            at all levels a government which will increasingly develop a commitment
                            not only against Communism but also to the cooperation of all its
                            factions and tendencies for the achievement of that objective and also
                            to programs designed to enlist the loyalty and support of the people. As
                            noted previously, this is a long-term process and there is nothing we
                            can do that will produce dramatic results.</p>
                        <p>(2) Assist and encourage the Vietnamese Government and, where possible,
                            groups with large popular followings, to develop cadres who can form the
                            nucleus in rural areas for organization of the population for economic
                            and social reconstruction and against the Viet Cong infrastructure.</p>
                        <p>(3) Develop with the Vietnamese Government, and press it to prosecute
                            vigorously, national programs which will give support to the efforts of
                            the cadres mentioned above. This includes land reform and agricultural
                            credit, land development, tax reform, encouragement of small industry
                            and handicrafts, and provision of a range of community development
                            projects which can be put at the disposal of the cadres to be used by
                            the cadres to support their political objectives.</p>
                        <p>(4) Advise and encourage the South Vietnamese Government to build from
                            the provincial councils elected in May of 1965 toward some national
                            representative body which might initially be elected indirectly and for
                            some time would have only limited responsibilities, such as drafting of
                            a new constitution. At provincial and lower levels, however, elected
                            bodies should promptly be given increasing responsibility where security
                            permits, and particularly where there are cadres who can work with such
                            bodies effectively.</p>
                        <p>(5) Meanwhile support the Government of Viet-Nam and occasionally on an
                            ad hoc basis substitute for it, in immediate programs (a) to meet
                            emergencies such as the refugee problem, (b) to supply urgently required
                            infrastructure and logistics for the military effort while trying to
                            minimize adverse effects on the civilian economy, (c) to stem inflation,
                            (d) to deny resources to the Viet Cong and secure those resources for
                            those areas under government control, and (e) to establish machinery and
                            a priority system to minimize to the extent possible competition for the
                            increasingly scarce manpower and materials, Vietnamese and American,
                            required for the complex of efforts now under way in South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <pb n="554" xml:id="pg_554" facs="0586"/>
                        <p>The intensification of these efforts, of course, particularly the
                            increased imports essential to control inflation, means increased <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> expenditures. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> expenditures this fiscal year are likely to be in the
                            order of $550 million. The amount required for FY 1967 is not yet
                            determined but it can be anticipated that something in the order of $650
                            million will be required.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Perhaps all of the foregoing does not give sufficient weight to the
                            problems as they appear to the other side. As has been pointed out they
                            can now have no hope of “victory”. A large part of our task is to
                            reinforce this conviction and not only to consult our own fears but also
                            to weigh the fears of the other side in drawing up our balance. A
                            stalemate can have no more attraction for them than it has for us. Our
                            determination and our will are certainly not less than theirs. If we
                            can, as recommended in this memorandum, continue to display an
                            increasing level of determination we should not despair, any more than
                            we did in Berlin, Korea and Cuba, of reaching a satisfactory conclusion
                            even though at the moment we may only see through the glass darkly
                            exactly how this is to be accomplished.</p>

                            objectives,” nor is the pessimism with respect to what can be done on
                            the non-military side inside South Vietnam.</p>

                        <p>The State memo departs from your version in the following four important
                            ways:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Pause</hi>. Secretary Rusk opposes a Pause now,
                            preferring to consider it later “if Hanoi appeared to be weakening.”
                            State's main arguments are (1) that a Pause would allow Hanoi to trap us
                            short of our goal so that we would not be able to resume Rolling Thunder
                            and (2) that it would cause serious trouble in Saigon. They add (3) that
                            it (especially if coupled with an intensified RT) would increase the
                            risk of a Soviet “flash” when bombing resumed. They see no chance of a
                            Pause leading to a favorable reaction from Hanoi or from the
                            “nationalist” <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, and they see no need
                            for a Pause to lay the domestic groundwork for the increase in US
                            deployments—perhaps because they believe that Phase II deployments can
                            be carried out quietly by a salami-slice technique. (Incidentally, it is
                            interesting to note that the State memo seems to assume that the Pause
                            is a “card” that can be “played” but once; whereas it is more reasonable
                            to think that it could be played any number of times, with the arguments
                            against it, but not those for it, becoming less each time.)</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Rolling Thunder</hi>. Secretary Rusk opposes what
                            State calls our “extrapolated” Rolling Thunder program, preferring a
                            “leveled-off” program (with periodic “hot and cold” treatments to keep
                            the enemy off base). State says that “no feasible amount of bombing of
                            the North is going to achieve an acceptable settlement in the absence of
                            a substantial improvement in the situation on the ground in the South.”
                            Specifically, they would postpone strikes on <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> targets and would postpone mining of harbors; they
                            would permit strikes at <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> targets
                            between Hanoi and Haiphong and would permit “controlled armed recce” in
                            the northeast quadrant outside the Hanoi-Haiphong circles; they would
                            perhaps shift some of the 600 sorties per week to Laos. As in the case
                            of the Pause, State would postpone the intensification of Rolling
                            Thunder, “leaving open the option of moving to the extrapolated program
                            if Hanoi appeared to be weakening.”</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Phase II</hi>. State apparently agrees with your
                            proposal to deploy Phase II forces. They apparently would put the
                            deployments in two packages (first two quarters of 1966 and last two
                            quarters of 1966) and wrap the packages as inconspicuously as possible.
                            I gather that they would not postpone preparations or budget submissions
                            beyond what would be required to meet the <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> Phase II schedule. (Notice that you may have had in
                            mind a faster deployment of Phase II than <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> requested or that State's plan would permit.)</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Evaluation</hi>. State seems to be more optimistic
                            than you. While they do not give good odds of success (and while they
                            give your approach higher odds both of a quick success and of a
                            “flash”), they are avowedly choosing a course “designed to play for the
                            breaks (as we did <pb n="556" xml:id="pg_556" facs="0588"/>in the Berlin
                            blockade and Korea) without actions that would bring the situation
                            prematurely to a head.”</p>
                        <p>My judgment is (a) that there is no real issue with respect to Phase II
                            deployments, (b) that State has a good point in their opposition to
                            “extrapolating” Rolling Thunder, and (c) that State is wrong with
                            respect to the Pause (I hate to miss the small chance it offers to turn
                            this thing around).</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, I think (d) that both papers set the goals unrealistically
                            high (we should not be fooling ourselves in this respect), (e) that
                            neither memo gives adequate emphasis to what Phases III and IV are
                            likely to look like (“occupation” of South Vietnam, “quarantine” of
                            Indo-China, pressures to invade North Vietnam, war costs at a rate equal
                            to 10-20 times the GNP of the people being fought for, etc.) and the
                            odds that we will have a Phase III and a Phase IV (50-70%), and (f) that
                            neither memo spells out a vigorous “diplomatic offensive” to accompany
                            the military actions.</p>

                        <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName>:</p>
                        <p>As you know, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clark Clifford</persName> and
                            Mr. Patrick Coyne were with us October 30. I expect that you have had a
                            more complete run-down than I could give you of the matters which
                            concerned them. If you have heard all you want to know on the subject,
                            you can toss this letter aside. But I will cover the ground of what was
                            said here—just in case you are interested.</p>
                        <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557" facs="0589"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>, who did the talking,
                            said the President spends much of his time on Vietnam, and feels forced
                            to make a great many decisions on the basis of inadequate information.
                            What we lack and what he wants, despite the difficulties, is hard
                            intelligence, including intelligence on matters outlined below.</p>
                        <p>1. Definite information about the Viet Cong. What about their attitudes?
                            Are they re-evaluating their position? Are their attitudes softening or
                            hardening?</p>
                        <p>2. North Vietnam. What is the thinking in Hanoi? Are the leaders there
                            determined, or are they seeking a way out? Should we extend and
                            accelerate the bombings? What about the populace: is it softening or
                            hardening? What is the attitude in North Vietnam towards peace
                            overtures?</p>
                        <p>3. What is the situation today in Red China? What is the attitude of the
                            Government there towards the war in South Vietnam? That they cannot
                            permit the war to be lost? Or that there are more important
                            considerations, such as the drive to make Communist China a nuclear
                            power? What is the attitude towards actual participation in the war?
                            What is the possibility they will, for instance, send troops? What
                            degree of assistance will Communist China give the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>: unlimited, or if not unlimited, what
                            is the limitation? Are the leaders in Peking determined to see the thing
                            through all the way? What is the degree of fear of becoming
                            over-involved—e. g., in a war with the U.S.?</p>
                        <p>I thought it might be useful to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName> to be given an indication of opinions we have
                            formed on some of these questions, and of our bases for forming them. In
                            giving them I observed that I was not trying to make him a channel for
                            our reporting. That deserved the greater degree of precision possible
                            with written material as opposed to oral communication, and the
                            qualifications one omits from thumb-nail summaries. The following
                            paragraphs represent, except as otherwise noted, an effort to
                            reconstruct from memory what I said after making those caveats.</p>
                        <p>It is hard for us at this distance, and with access to only some of the
                            available intelligence, to judge whether the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are softening up or hardening. We watch the statistics,
                            but many of them are of questionable value. For instance, for seven
                            weeks the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> had lost more weapons than
                            the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>, whereas the opposite used to
                            be true. But did these losses mean that VC morale and discipline were
                            slipping, or that they now had such a relatively plentiful supply of
                            weapons that they were no longer exercising the same care to prevent
                            weapons losses? (Incidentally, accounts I have seen of the Pleime battle
                            suggest that the fighting discipline of the attackers, comprising <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            regulars, was good indeed. I wonder whether the bombing of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> does not give the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> regulars a doubled motive for
                            fighting—there is added to the <pb n="558" xml:id="pg_558" facs="0590"/>motive of “liberating” the south, preparatory to reunification, the
                            motive of getting back at an enemy which is bombing their homeland.)</p>
                        <p>I expressed to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName> the
                            belief that the leaders in the North are a tough lot, unlikely to soften
                            under bombings. If they lost the relatively small industrial sector they
                            have built up, I expected them to count on rebuilding it with Soviet and
                            Chi-Com help. The accounts of visitors to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and the intercepted letters from people there which we
                            had read led us to think the bombings were, if anything, hardening
                            popular attitudes towards the U.S. and cementing the loyalty of the
                            people to the regime. It did not look to us as though the leaders and
                            people of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> were ready to respond
                            to overtures.</p>
                        <p>I said the leaders of Red China regarded the war in South Vietnam as a
                            highly important proving ground for Mao's doctrines on wars of national
                            liberation. They would certainly give all the necessary material
                            assistance they could spare. We believed the DRV would not want them to
                            send in masses of Chinese troops into North Vietnam itself unless that
                            proved absolutely necessary, and that Communist China's leaders would
                            hesitate to send them unless the existence of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> appeared threatened. The Chinese
                            Communists are very powerful defensively on their own terrain—Communist
                            China is probably impregnable to military occupation and political
                            domination; it is sensitive about its borders and formidable in areas
                            near them; it lacks the strategic mobility to project military power
                            very far beyond those areas. There was plenty of evidence that Communist
                            China feared U.S. attack and that people in South China fear war (our
                            reading of intercepted letters shows this to be so). Communist China
                            would fight if attacked, but I was not convinced the Chinese Communists
                            would surely throw in their own troops to prevent the defeat of the Viet
                            Cong rebellion, should our forces appear to be bringing the situation in
                            South Vietnam under control. They conceivably could respond to dwindling
                            prospects with the decision it would be better for the VC to draw back,
                            preserve all the assets they could and wait for a better day. However, I
                            thought the leaders in Communist China were like the leaders of other
                            governments in some respects: they probably make some important
                            decisions only as the relevant situations develop, instead of having
                            decided in advance what they would do in all of a variety of
                            contingencies.</p>
                        <p>I added that I thought some of the answers to the questions Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName> asked should be available
                            within the U.S. Government through a careful fitting together of all
                            relevant bits and pieces of information. (I also might have observed
                            that some answers will come to those with sufficient background and
                            experience by a process sometimes considered intuitive, i.e. by
                            “feel”—but that would have raised the question of whose “feel” is to be
                            trusted, and whose not? Still, to me, at least, it seems <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0591"/>unlikely that we shall get many answers
                            to the hard questions in the form of pieces of intelligence we can point
                            to as “hard.”)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName> asked very few
                            questions about this analysis as I went along and none about it
                            afterwards. We then set forth our various sources of information and
                            there was a little discussion of how they could be improved—e.g., by
                            more extended tapping of British businessmen engaged in trade with
                            Communist China. The meeting then closed.</p>
                        <p>This “open” meeting included myself, my deputy, the chief of the China
                            Mainland Section, the three military liaison officers, and the CAS
                            station chief. The station chief also had a private session with Messrs.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName> and Coyne, which he
                            has reported through his channels.</p>
                        <p>I should have liked to write this hard upon Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>'s visit, when I could
                            reconstruct my part of dialogue with greater confidence. But we have
                            been inundated by visitors—Governors, trade missions, and CODELs. We
                            will have one arriving on the average every day, with most of them
                            staying for some days, at least through November—but will do the best we
                            can to continue turning out the necessary regular work meanwhile.</p>

                        <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Cabot</persName>:</p>
                        <p>This personal letter is something of a comment on your 1377<note n="2" xml:id="d197fn2">
                                <ref target="#d176">Document 176</ref>.</note> which gives much room
                            for thought.</p>
                        <pb n="560" xml:id="pg_560" facs="0592"/>
                        <p>At present we do not see, through all of the processes of diplomatic
                            “osmosis”, an indication that Hanoi is prepared to enter seriously into
                            negotiations on the basis of stopping their aggression against South
                            Viet Nam and establishing peace in Southeast Asia. It is my impression,
                            and this has been reflected by some comments in the Communist world,
                            that there may well be divided views within Hanoi. But these shades of
                            difference do not indicate any decision in Hanoi to hold their hand and
                            make peace.</p>
                        <p>It may well be that Hanoi and the Viet Cong would prefer to pull back de
                            facto rather than through negotiations. This was the way the Greek
                            guerrilla affair was wound up. From Hanoi's point of view, a de facto
                            cessation would avoid their having to confess that they were ever doing
                            anything against the South and would avoid commitments with respect to
                            the future. We should always be very alert to significant signs that
                            they are in fact pulling out—but I have not yet seen them.</p>
                        <p>The subject of “negotiation” is complex and difficult. I am convinced
                            that one of the important strengths of our situation, both at home and
                            abroad, is the demonstration that the obstacle to peace in Southeast
                            Asia is not the United States. I have just finished talking with more
                            than 70 Foreign Ministers—most of whom were here for the opening session
                            of the General Assembly. It seems evident that we have made the point
                            convincingly that the obstacle to peace in Southeast Asia is Hanoi and
                            Peiping. The principal means by which this has been achieved has been a
                            demonstrated readiness on our part to have “negotiations without
                            preconditions”, as the 17 non-aligned nations phrased it, or
                            “unconditional discussions” as the President phrased it.<note n="3" xml:id="d197fn3">For text of the appeal by 17 nonaligned countries,

                                    Document 245</ref>.</note> The rejection by Hanoi and Peiping of
                            many peace efforts has clarified the policy problems very well.</p>
                        <p>I also believe that this is an issue which has to do with what might be
                            called “war leadership” of the American people. There is no more
                            peace-loving people in the world. But the American people will do what
                            has to be done if they are convinced that the object is right and that
                            there is no honorable alternative. Our attitude toward negotiation is an
                            integral part of the willingness of our own people to sustain a mean
                            disagreeable struggle half way around the world.</p>
                        <p>The point which would concern me most would be the idea that the war must
                            be continued because the South Vietnamese authorities with whom we are
                            dealing are afraid of peace. I find it hard to accept the view that the
                            South Vietnamese people would be the first people in history voluntarily
                            to accept a Communist regime through genuinely free elections.<pb n="561" xml:id="pg_561" facs="0593"/> All of our effort in South
                            Viet Nam for more than a decade has been based upon the assumption that
                            the South Vietnamese people do not want communism, do not wish it
                            imposed by force, and would not have it if they had a choice. In any
                            event, I see great difficulty in accepting the internal political
                            difficulties of the South Vietnamese as a war aim of the United States.
                            I had supposed that American combat forces are in South Viet Nam because
                            of the infiltration of large numbers of men and large quantities of arms
                            by North Viet Nam into the South. We are there to defend South Viet Nam
                            against external aggression—an attempt to impose a political solution by
                            force upon the South Vietnamese against their own wills.</p>
                        <p>Frankly, I do not know whether the negotiations will come about in the
                            near future or at all. I do know that it will be contrary to our most
                            fundamental policy to permit negotiations to accomplish what we have
                            resisted by force. It may be that Hanoi and Peiping recognize this
                            elementary point and, therefore, see no possibility of accomplishing
                            their purposes through negotiation. If so, they are well advised.</p>
                        <p>I realize that the current crop of GVN leaders may be nervous about the
                            idea of negotiations. But they must realize that we have not made the
                            effort and undertaken the burdens of supporting a free South Viet Nam in
                            order to throw in our objectives at a conference table.</p>
                        <p>I was much interested in the recent conversation you had with the
                            Apostolic Delegate and we shared your skepticism. But if there is any
                            reality in this possibility, nothing could give the entire effort out
                            there a bigger shot in the arm than something important along that
                            line.</p>
                        <p>We think of you daily and are grateful for the quality and dedication of
                            the job you are doing.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_LBJ1">LBJ</gloss> Ranch in Texas. (Johnson Library,
                            President's Daily Diary) According to a tentative agenda for the
                            meeting, prepared for the President by Bundy on November 11, Vietnam was
                            one of nine items to be discussed. In the annotated agenda, Bundy
                            briefed the President on Vietnam as follows:</p>
                        <p>“The most important issues here are treated in the long draft Defense
                            memorandum as revised in the State Department [<ref target="#d189">Documents 189</ref> and <ref target="#d194">194</ref>]. In the
                            main, we are not looking for major decisions but for guidance in further
                            planning. In essence, the issues are these:</p>
                        <p>“(1) Should we currently plan for substantial additional deployments in
                            1966?</p>
                        <p>“(2) Should any such additional deployments be preceded by a pause in
                            bombing and/or a new diplomatic effort to prevent further enlargement of
                            the contest? If we want a pause, we must begin to plan for it very
                            promptly.</p>
                        <p>“(3) What should be our current attitude toward increased bombing in the
                            North in 1966?</p>
                        <p>“(4) Do we need to choose between the <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> views of negotiation now?</p>
                        <p>“(5) Are we agreed on the underlying purpose of our effort in Vietnam: is
                            it to seek a compromise settlement which would eventually turn
                            Communist—or is it to ensure by all necessary means the establishment
                            and maintenance of a non-Communist South Vietnam—and is this the real
                            choice we face?</p>
                        <p>“(6)We also have questions of timing and consultation: when should
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> come back or when
                            should we go to him? When should we begin additional consultation with
                            Congress—or is such consultation needed? What, in short, is the
                            time-table of decision in the coming weeks?” (Johnson Library, National

                            and Viet Cong forces are maintaining relatively strong military
                            pressure. Following a brief decline in Viet Cong activity in September,
                            which may have marked the transition from the largely frustrated summer
                            campaign to the current autumn-winter campaign, the tempo of Viet Cong
                            actions has risen to the highest levels in over a year. The scene of
                            major operations appears to have shifted with the rainy season from the
                            highlands to the coastal provinces, with large-scale attacks recorded in
                            Quang Tri, Phu Yen, and Binh Dinh. Nevertheless, current activity in
                            Pleiku Province indicated that the enemy retains significant
                            capabilities in the highlands.</p>
                        <p>3. “No regimental-size operations have been mounted by the Viet Cong
                            since June in the III Corps area. Viet Cong main force units in this
                            region apparently have been kept off balance by US-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> ground and air operations, which have
                            inflicted substantial losses in terms of equipment and supplies. Viet
                            Cong capabilities in this area evidently are being reinforced, however,
                            by the movement of North Vietnamese Army elements from the highlands and
                            the continuing flow of Viet Cong elements coming from the Delta.</p>
                        <p>4. “Activity in the Delta has increased markedly during the past two
                            months, but consists largely of small-scale harassments and sabotage
                            activities. The lack of aggressive large-scale attacks in this area
                            suggests that the capabilities of main force units have been temporarily
                            reduced by the transfer of cadres and troops to other areas.
                            Nevertheless, the sizeable Viet Cong forces remaining in the Delta
                            appear capable of maintaining their hold on wide areas of the
                            countryside.</p>
                        <p>5. “The build-up of Viet Cong conventional military capabilities is
                            continuing, despite the heavy losses suffered in large-scale
                            engagements. <pb n="564" xml:id="pg_564" facs="0596"/>Documents captured
                            in the Delta in August directed the upgrading of half of the village
                            guerrillas to permit the build-up of main force units. This
                            extraordinary measure, which could produce enough manpower to form two
                            or three new regiments, was rationalized in the documents as necessary
                            to restore the balance of forces which had been upset by the
                            introduction of U.S. and allied ground combat units.</p>
                        <p>6. “Paralleling this internal reinforcement, the enemy has infiltrated a
                            number of additional North Vietnamese Army elements in recent months.
                            Two additional regimental-sized North Vietnamese Army units have been
                            identified, and there are indications that at least two others may also
                            have arrived. While some of these may comprise cadre groups to permit
                            the creation of new Viet Cong main force units, others apparently are
                            integral North Vietnamese Army combat units. In either case, these
                            elements, well equipped with modern small arms and heavy weapons,
                            represent a significant reinforcement of Viet Cong capabilities.</p>
                        <p>7. “Paralleling the continuing build-up of Viet Cong forces is the
                            construction of a motorable road from North Viet-Nam through the Laos
                            panhandle to a point at least as far south as Kontum Province. This main
                            route, which is nearing completion, together with lateral roads leading
                            into South Viet-Nam at several points, will permit a substantial
                            increase in the flow of supplies and equipment through Laos, and may
                            replace the now insecure sea infiltration route as the principal axis
                            for Viet Cong logistical support. With a dependable supply route capable
                            of moving ammunition in quantities, the capabilities of Viet Cong forces
                            in the highlands to sustain large-scale operations will be enhanced.
                            Their forces in the Delta, however, will remain largely dependent on
                            shipments by sea or via Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>8. “Politically and psychologically, the Viet Cong position is less
                            favorable. Although many of the basic factors which contributed to
                            political instability in Saigon last year remain unresolved, the rebuff
                            of the Viet Cong summer campaign and the U.S. and allied military
                            build-up have removed popular fears of an early Viet Cong victory and
                            thereby enhanced the prospects for governmental stability. Nevertheless,
                            the <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> government remains subject
                            to political pressure from the Viet Cong and from opposing political
                            circles. The government has not had time to demonstrate progress in
                            implementing its programs and faces growing economic difficulties. An
                            effective, integrated pacification program is only in the early stages.
                            Repeated success by security forces in uncovering terrorist and
                            propaganda rings in urban areas have disrupted Viet Cong capabilities in
                            this field and shaken the confidence of their clandestine agents. The
                            Liberation Front suffered a significant psychological setback when the
                            populace generally ignored the Front's unprecedented propaganda appeal
                            for a general strike and hour of silence on 15 October to commemorate
                            the anniversary of the execution of a Viet Cong terrorist. <pb n="565" xml:id="pg_565" facs="0597"/>The failure of this appeal, and the
                            absence thus far of any spectacular terrorist acts during the
                            much-heralded, month-long ‘Hate America’ campaign represent a blow to
                            Viet Cong prestige among the populace which they may try to recoup.
                            Despite these failures terrorism remains a potent Viet Cong weapon, and
                            the Viet Cong can be expected to make concerted efforts to embarrass and
                            harass Americans through terrorist attacks.</p>
                        <p>9. “There are growing signs of declining morale among Viet Cong military
                            units as well as in the population in Viet Cong-dominated areas. This
                            decline appears to be the result of tactical setbacks and the impact of
                            sustained U.S.-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> air attacks on Viet
                            Cong areas. It is reflected in the growing rate of deflections and Chieu
                            Hoi ralliers, as well as in captured documents, statements of captives,
                            and the defensive tone of Front propaganda. Although the Communists have
                            overcome morale setbacks before through extensive indoctrination
                            programs, no significant improvement in Viet Cong morale is likely in
                            the absence of some successes on the battlefield which they are certain
                            to seek.</p>
                        <p>10. “Viet Cong economic fortunes have been mixed. Their propaganda is
                            actively exploiting the rising cost of living throughout Viet-Nam. Viet
                            Cong efforts to disrupt the economy further and thereby add to
                            inflationary trends are reflected in their continuing sabotage of
                            communications lines and their imposition of an embargo on the flow of
                            goods to markets in some <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>-controlled
                            areas. On the other hand, economic hardships are increasing in Viet
                            Cong-dominated areas. There are indications that their tax collections
                            are not sufficient to meet their financial requirements despite
                            increasingly heavy tax rates. Moreover, the income of farmers has been
                            further reduced by the restrictions on delivery of goods to markets.</p>
                        <p>11. “In view of their mixed prospects, it is pertinent to review the
                            alternatives which the Viet Cong may adopt in pursuing their aims in
                            South Viet-Nam. The broad alternate approaches open to them are: a)
                            major overt escalation in order to seek an early military decision; b)
                            continuation of the current strategy of augmenting their capabilities
                            for the gradual transition to conventional warfare; c) reversion to a
                            lesser scale of insurgency; or d) a negotiated settlement.</p>
                        <p>12. “Although the first course offers prospects for quick success, it
                            carries with it the risk of triggering a massive U.S. response. While
                            North Vietnamese ground forces possess considerable strength, disruption
                            of the lines of communication in the north by U.S.-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> airstrikes may have restricted the size
                            of forces which could be supported in a conventional invasion of the
                            south. The extent of this restriction has not yet been determined. North
                            Vietnamese air capabilities remain weak, and while these could be
                            augmented by the commitment of Chinese Communist air units, the latter
                            course would risk U.S. retaliation against the Chinese <pb n="566" xml:id="pg_566" facs="0598"/>Mainland. Despite its continuing
                            propaganda bombast, Peking has shown no inclination to risk general war
                            with the U.S., and its actions in support of North Viet-Nam have been
                            essentially defensive in scope. U.S. airstrikes on the north and the
                            deployment of U.S. ground forces to South Viet-Nam must have raised
                            doubts in Peking regarding their image of the U.S. as a “paper tiger,”
                            and created uncertainties as to how the U.S. would react to any further
                            escalation of the war. Peking may also hold back because it sees no need
                            to change its past strategy, except to strengthen its support to the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>13. “The second alternative—continuing the build-up for transition to
                            conventional warfare—may be viewed by the Communists as carrying less
                            risk of provoking any new major escalation by the U.S. This course is in
                            accordance with Chinese and North Viet-Nam's doctrinal concepts of
                            “liberation wars,” and any deviation from it would be difficult for them
                            to rationalize to their adherents. Both Hanoi and the Liberation Front
                            had stated that their major aim for this year was the build-up of Viet
                            Cong capabilities to achieve a strategic balance of force as a prelude
                            to the general counteroffensive. There is evidence that they concluded
                            this summer that this goal is still attainable, despite the build-up of
                            U.S. and allied forces, and that they have undertaken new measures to
                            restore the balance. Lines of communication from the north are adequate
                            to sustain the infiltration and operations of a limited number of
                            additional North Vietnamese Army units. Although the Viet Cong have
                            suffered substantial losses in large-scale operations, their replacement
                            system appears effective and the Communists do not seem thus far to have
                            been deterred from continuing such actions. The Communists may calculate
                            that this alternative, combined with extensive terrorism—a course which
                            proved successful against the French—offers the best prospects for
                            wearing down the will and determination of the U.S. to continue the war.
                            If their build-up permits them to regain the initiative and momentum on
                            the battlefield which they enjoyed earlier this year, they may feel that
                            the impact on <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> and civilian morale
                            will cause a resumption of political instability which could prove
                            decisive on the outcome of the war.</p>
                        <p>14. “The third alternative—reversion to a lesser level of
                            insurgency—would entail serious risks to Viet Cong morale. The
                            Communists might feel that, by foregoing large-scale attacks and
                            diverting their main forces units to support of local forces in
                            small-scale guerrilla actions, their vulnerability to air attacks and
                            large-scale sweeps by U.S.-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces
                            would be reduced. The Communists would encounter substantial problems,
                            however, in rationalizing this doctrinally. Moreover, the loss of
                            momentum would almost certainly cause a major drop in the morale of Viet
                            Cong troops and political cadres, and result in a substantial increase
                            in defections which could reach disastrous proportions for <pb n="567" xml:id="pg_567" facs="0599"/>the Viet Cong. It would similarly
                            enhance the confidence of the civilian populace int he ultimate defeat
                            of the Viet Cong. Although guerrilla activity would continue to disrupt
                            lines of communication and harass pacified areas, U.S.-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces would be able to devote more
                            support of rural construction programs and permit the gradual extension
                            of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> control into areas now held by
                            the Viet Cong. Thus the Communists would risk substantial—and possibly
                            irretrievable—losses to their position by adopting this alternative.</p>
                        <p>15. “The fourth alternative—seeking a negotiated settlement—also offers
                            mixed blessings to the Communists. The Viet Cong would first negotiate
                            to gain time to build their strength and undermine ours and second to
                            gain a satisfactory settlement. Doctrinally, negotiations would be a
                            feasible alternative if their outcome assured attainment of their
                            ultimate goals, which are unchanged. If their position became
                            progressively weaker through the failure of other alternatives, so that
                            a favorable settlement were not feasible, they might prefer a withering
                            away of the Viet Cong insurgency to embarking on fruitless negotiations.
                            In any event, they are unlikely to seek negotiations, unit they are
                            convinced that victory through other means is not possible.</p>
                        <p>16. “Current indications point to the second alternative—continuation of
                            the build-up of Viet Cong capabilities for conventional operations.
                            These indications include: a) evidence of the infiltration of additional
                            military units from North Viet-Nam; b) the build-up of main force units
                            at the expense of village guerrilla units; c) captured documents of late
                            July stating that Viet Cong goals for 1965 remain unchanged; d)
                            continued confidence and determination to press the war as reflected in
                            Hanoi and Liberation Front statements; e) final construction of a
                            motorable supply south through Laos; f) resumption of large-scale

                            increase in Viet Cong activity since early October; h) continued
                            development of North Viet-Nam's air defense capabilities, with Chinese
                            and Soviet support, to reduce the effectiveness of U.S. air strikes and

                            survive them; and i) the continuing fragility of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and its vulnerability to Viet Cong
                            pressures.</p>
                        <p>17. “In conclusion, we believe the enemy will continue for the next
                            several months at least on his current course of action. We believe the
                            Viet Cong are forming new main force units within South Viet-Nam, and
                            will infiltrate additional units—perhaps the equivalent of one or two
                            divisions—from the north. By doing so, the Communists will hope to
                            restore a strategic balance of forces in order to regain the initiative
                            through a combination of large-scale attacks and widespread guerrilla
                            action. Their purpose will be to expand their base areas, inflict
                            maximum attrition on U.S. and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> elite
                            units, erode U.S. determination to continue the war, and weaken
                            Vietnamese morale with a view to creating conditions <pb n="568" xml:id="pg_568" facs="0600"/>favorable for the collapse of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. We do not expect the Viet Cong
                            to revert to a lesser level of insurgency or to seek a negotiated
                            settlement until they are convinced that their current course will not
                            succeed. The point is not likely to be reached until the capabilities of
                            the forces now being created and deployed have been neutralized or
                            impaired in battle. The units recently infiltrated from North Vietnam
                            will probably be ready for battle within a month after arrival. It may
                            be three months before units now being created are ready for
                            combat.”</p>

                        <p>1315. Exdis for Ambassador from Secretary. I am deeply concerned about
                            limited degree of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> compliance with
                            Geneva Conventions on treatment of prisoners. As you know, US is
                            responsible under GC for treatment of prisoners transferred from US to
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> custody. Matter is urgent for
                            sake of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and US image abroad and as
                            it affects plight of US prisoners held by <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>We have an obligation to our soldiers and citizens to take every action
                            not detrimental to security that increases likelihood American prisoners
                            will receive satisfactory treatment. Leverage we can bring to bear on
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> through <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> and other
                            international efforts depends to considerable extent on degree to which
                            US and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> standards of prisoner
                            treatment meet requirements of Geneva Conventions. I believe that
                            substantial compliance by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> with Convention and publicity given
                            such compliance constitute one of best available protections against

                        <p>Accordingly request you raise matter personally on urgent basis with
                            Prime Minister and other <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials
                            where it will have most effect, impressing on them in strongest terms

                            prisoners and unaccompanied visits to POW's. This is essential first
                            step, should not cause serious difficulties, and would have high
                            potential for reciprocal benefits for American prisoners and for

                        <p>1760. For the President. Herewith my weekly telegram:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Military</p>
                        <p>The most interesting event of the week was the appearance of military
                            units in South Viet-Nam consisting entirely of North Vietnamese
                            personnel. In addition to the three regiments of the North Vietnamese
                            325th Division already carried, General Westmoreland has evidence of the
                            presence of the equivalent of one other division and possibly more. The
                            North Vietnamese appear to be giving considerable attention to the
                            improvement of the line of communications through the Laos panhandle.
                            Earthmoving equipment had been observed. This would permit greater
                            support to the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <pb n="570" xml:id="pg_570" facs="0602"/>
                        <p>This adds a third facet to the war. We have hitherto had to cope with (1)
                            the main force Viet Cong units, containing about 35 percent of Viet Cong
                            strength and (2) the guerrilla terrorists containing some 65 percent—all
                            directed by Hanoi. Now come units which are all from the north.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. First Cavalry heavily engaged elements of four regular North
                            Vietnamese regiments west of Pleiku near the Cambodian border for three
                            days at the beginning of this week inflicting heavy casualties in what
                            may turn out to be the biggest U.S. battle in the war to date.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> told me at Tay
                            Ninh today that he believes there are two <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> divisions in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and
                            that “they will keep on sending divisions down until the line of
                            communication is cut”.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Basic political</p>
                        <p>Today I went to Tay Ninh where Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> officially inaugurated a <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> program whereby about 700,000 acres of state-owned land
                            goes to about 180,000 farmers. Communism took over China largely on the
                            strength of the slogan “land to the tiller.” In Tay Ninh I saw this
                            slogan actually being carried out. I know of your long-standing interest
                            in this and, as you know, the U.S. has helped a great deal. To me this
                            is a concrete example of what we mean by “true revolution”.</p>
                        <p>The number of returnees under the Chieu Hoi program again increased over
                            last week's figure. Analysis of police arrest figures for the first week
                            of November showed a downward trend in the number of deserters and draft
                            dodgers apprehended and an increase in the number of suspected <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and illegal residents rounded up.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Economic</p>
                        <p>For the second successive week prices declined in Saigon, notably in
                            pork, fish, charcoal and rice—the things the masses consume. Rice is
                            actually below last year's level. This is in particular a vindication of
                            our rice policy and in general none of the above would have been
                            possible without U.S. help—and heroic measures in which many hardworking
                            Washington officials can take pride.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Pacification—“Rural Construction”</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_Thang1">Thang</persName> of “Rural
                            Construction” traveled to I, II and IV Corps to meet new and provisional
                            rural construction committees consisting of Corps and Divisional
                            Commanders and Province Chief. He urged realistic planning, stimulation
                            of local initiative, teamwork between military and civilians and, above
                            all, response to the needs and aspirations of the people. He wants
                            elections for executive leadership in the villages to be held as soon as
                            there is freedom from intimidation. He shows marked enthusiasm and verve
                            in all of this.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_Thang1">Thang</persName> is also working on
                            creating groups (cadre) which can go into the village and stay
                            indefinitely, capable of self-defense.</p>
                        <pb n="571" xml:id="pg_571" facs="0603"/>
                        <p>I now have learned that his two top priority objectives will be eight
                            villages each in Quang Nam and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Binh
                                Dinh</persName>. The talk now is of a team of 60 men for each
                            village of which the 40 man political action team will be the nucleus.
                            These estimates and plans change all the time as they learn more about
                            the realities, I report it as I learn about it.</p>
                        <p>My feeling about pacification is two-fold: that we are certainly on the
                            right track and all too often, that the train isn't moving. And then I
                            think of the unfortunate results of going too fast and of striving for
                            flashy effects as the Vietnamese are all too prone to do. I also recall
                            that Minister Thang is not impulsive and is a careful, thorough, though
                            energetic, man. And I conclude that maybe we can't go much faster at
                            this stage.</p>

                            State come out on opposite sides, and for very good reasons. The man who
                            has to present next year's defense budget will want to have made a last
                            full try. The man who has to cope with an effort by the Communists to
                            embarrass us by ambiguous responses to a pause tends to be against it.
                            (Schoenbrun's story today about the North Vietnamese feelers to the
                            French is an example of what we could expect in spades in a new
                            pause.)</p>

                        <p>My own judgment is marginally against the pause, perhaps because I am
                            more concerned with the diplomatic aspects than with the military
                            budget. But I also have some feeling that if we pause, we may seem to
                            admit that our bombing is the cause of the trouble, and this is simply
                            not so. This is a matter which we can brood over without a meeting for
                            another few days—if you wish—but it is of such importance that I feel an
                            obligation to submit it to you now.</p>

                        <p>Secto 16. Eyes only for the President and the Acting Secretary from the
                            Secretary. I deeply regret that I am not in Washington to assist in
                            handling press problems deriving from Sevareid story.<note n="2" xml:id="d203fn2">In the November 30 issue of <hi rend="italic">Look</hi> magazine (on the newstands by November 16) <persName corresp="#p_SE1">Eric Sevareid</persName> wrote an account of a
                                conversation with <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Adlai
                                    Stevenson</persName>, held just 2 days before <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> died. <persName corresp="#p_SE1">Sevareid</persName>'s article, entitled “The
                                Final Troubled Hours of <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Adlai
                                    Stevenson</persName>,” claimed that U.N. Secretary-General
                                    <persName corresp="#p_TU1">Thant</persName> obtained agreement
                                from North Vietnam in early autumn 1964 to send an emissary to
                                Rangoon to discuss with U.S. representatives possible peace terms.
                                According to the <persName corresp="#p_SE1">Sevareid</persName>
                                article, “someone in Washington” insisted on postponing the meeting
                                until after the Presidential election. When the matter was pursued
                                after the election, Sevareid stated that Hanoi was still willing to
                                talk, but <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> was
                                opposed to the idea. Thant supposedly offered to let Washington
                                write the terms of a cease-fire, but <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> turned him down and Rusk did not
                                respond.</note> Here are my comments and suggestions as seen from
                            here. You may wish to draft a suggested statement for me to make, taking
                            into account issues which have been raised up there.</p>
                        <p>1. I am confident that <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Adlai
                                Stevenson</persName> would not have written the <hi rend="italic">Look</hi> article.<note n="3" xml:id="d203fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> discussed the <persName corresp="#p_SE1">Sevareid</persName> article on the telephone
                                with <persName corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>, Rusk, and McGeorge Bundy
                                on the morning of November 17. Transcripts of <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s telephone calls of 9:15
                                (with <persName corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName>), 10:45 (<persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>), 11 (Rusk), 11 (<persName corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName>), and 11:15 a.m. (McGeorge
                                Bundy) are in the Johnson Library, Papers of George Ball, Telephone
                                Conversations, Vietnam.</note> That is why he put his talk off the
                            record. Nor am I confident <pb n="573" xml:id="pg_573" facs="0605"/>that
                            the article fairly represents the long conversation. I do not suggest we
                            get into a pitched battle with <persName corresp="#p_SE1">Sevareid</persName> on veracity when the referee is dead. But I
                            note that <persName corresp="#p_SE1">Sevareid</persName> did not report
                            his conversation as a working reporter through his normal channel
                            (television) but wrote a special article for which he probably received
                            a very substantial fee. Under these circumstances, such an article is
                            not likely to avoid the temptation of dramatic effect. But those of us
                            who have spent long hours over a period of many years with <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Adlai</persName> know that one of his charms was a
                            touch of Hamlet. On the subject of resigning, he and I had just had a
                            long talk before his departure for Europe about his plans and
                            arrangements and travel for the rest of the year and the handling of the
                            General Assembly. He was reluctant to accept the job in December 1960
                            and every few months since then said something about perhaps staying
                            through the “next General Assembly.”</p>
                        <p>2. On the Hanoi matter, my recollection is that there was some discussion
                            of some such contact before November but I would have to check my own
                            calendar for my own visits to New York and Adlai's visits to Washington
                            to help my memory.<note n="4" xml:id="d203fn4">See <ref target="frus1964-68v01">

                        </p>
                        <p>3. At no time did <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Adlai Stevenson</persName>
                            and I talk about this problem in connection with the US election. We
                            discussed (a) the third-hand nature of the contact and U Thant's warning
                            that Soviet official representatives in New York and Washington were not
                            informed; (b) the absence of any indication as to substance; (c) the
                            difficulties of contact in a relatively small country where diplomatic
                            representatives are under many eyes; (d) the negative results of other
                            contacts of which we were then aware.</p>
                        <p>4. You might consider, after checking with Paul Martin, surfacing the
                            timing of the first Seaborn contact in Hanoi. The Canadians have already
                            surfaced a part of them and the negative reactions which <persName corresp="#p_SJB1">Seaborn</persName> encountered were a part of this
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>5. Most compelling concern in my own mind was the possibility of a trap
                            in the absence of any indication of a forthcoming attitude on any point
                            of substance. I was concerned that bilateral contact in Rangoon would be
                            made the basis for spreading the word among the South Vietnamese that
                            the US was dickering for a settlement behind the backs of Saigon.
                            Recalling the then situation in Saigon, this could well have been
                            disastrous.</p>
                        <p>6. In diplomacy there is a difference between rejecting a proposal and
                            not accepting it. This is illustrated by <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName>'s remark to <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Cleveland</persName> about “there may be a time—but not now.” I did
                            not think that we should use this particular channel at that time but,
                            on the other hand, did not wish to foreclose that or any other channel
                            for the future. This distinction was made to U Thant but was apparently
                            lost on him.</p>
                        <pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574" facs="0606"/>
                        <p>7. Bob McNamara had nothing whatever to do with these particular
                            conversations. Why <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Adlai
                                Stevenson</persName> (or <persName corresp="#p_SE1">Sevareid</persName>) attributed a negative reaction to him is
                            beyond my comprehension.</p>
                        <p>8. I recall that Stevenson and I together had a brief exchange with U
                            Thant on this matter but I would have to check my calendar carefully to
                            try to identify the date. In that conversation, I affirmed to U Thant
                            our interest in a peaceful settlement and suggested to him that he use
                            the same channel to probe the substance. He was very reluctant to do so
                            and I do not wish to get into the problem of veracity with U Thant with
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> no longer here.</p>
                        <p>9. The President and I early this year discussed one aspect of this
                            matter on which I believe an error was made and by me. U Thant,
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> and I were so
                            concerned with secrecy that neither <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> nor I kept a written account of the
                            conversations of last year. The President quite rightly suggested that
                            anything in the nature of proposals coming from or through <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> be reduced to writing and
                            that our response and reaction also be in writing in order to avoid
                            misunderstanding.</p>
                        <p>10. U Thant's own recollections as reflected in Tosec 39<note n="5" xml:id="d203fn5">In Tosec 39, November 18, the Department of State
                                reconstructed the Rusk-U Thant discussions from August 1964 to March
                                1965 on the Secretary-General's suggestion that the United States
                                and the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> meet in Rangoon to
                                discuss peace in Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> told Rusk that the “highest authority” wanted
                                Rusk's “best recollection of private talks with <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> on this subject,” as well
                                as any comments on modification of the reconstructed chronology.
                                (Department of State, Ball Files: Lot 74 D 272, Vietnam—U
                                Thant)</note> seem to remove the idea that we on our side discussed
                            this in relation to our elections although apparently he himself took
                            such elections into account.</p>
                        <p>11. I would have to say that neither U Thant nor <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> would lose the chance to
                            believe that peace was about to break out and that they themselves had
                            played an important part in it. But I would add that, at the time,
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Adlai</persName> did not express
                            disagreement to me but seemed fully in accord with the idea that the
                            possibility should be left open but that it should not be acted upon
                            under the then existing circumstances.</p>
                        <p>12. It might be well to review the chronology of Hanoi's attitude
                            beginning with their contempt for the Laos Agreements of 1962. It is
                            ridiculous to suppose that Hanoi's attitude toward continuing or
                            stopping the war turned upon whether one particular channel out of all
                            of the channels which have been attempted was to be used. They have had
                            literally dozens of opportunities to bring this matter to discussion or
                            conference. Instead, they continue their infiltration, including regular
                            army units, and have been resistant to suggestions for a peaceful
                            settlement which have come to them even from within the Communist

                        <p>13. Please let me know whether you think it is well for me to make a
                            statement on this subject. I am appalled that <persName corresp="#p_SE1">Eric Sevareid</persName> would feel that <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0607"/>the off-the-record nature of this
                            discussion was canceled by <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName>'s death. But, I would have to say in his
                            behalf that under the circumstances of off the record, <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Adlai</persName> could say things, as a
                            scintillating conversationalist, which he himself would not say under
                            conditions of complete context and responsibility.</p>

                        <p>Attached is our status report for non-military programs covering roughly
                            the past five weeks.<note n="2" xml:id="d204fn2">Not printed. Bundy sent
                                the report to the President under cover of a note that reads: “If
                                you have time for it, this report on the non-military program in
                                Vietnam is worth your attention—this continues to be our toughest
                                long-range set of problems, in spite of all the headlines.” There is
                                an indication on the covering memorandum that the President saw it.
                                (Ibid.)</note> It may provide the President with a useful feel for
                            what we've been doing.</p>
                        <p>The very nature of the non-military struggle in Vietnam is such that we
                            cannot realistically expect dramatic progress from one month to the
                            next. During the past month there have been some concrete results and
                            advances. Both our own efforts and those of the Vietnamese have been
                            impressive, but these efforts must be measured against a backdrop of
                            enormous economic, social, political and security problems. Much is
                            being done. Much more has yet to be done.</p>
                        <p>At the national level, the most encouraging sign continues to be the
                            growing responsiveness of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            leadership to the requirements in this field and its willingness to take
                            new initiatives. This constructive <pb n="576" xml:id="pg_576" facs="0608"/>attitude is particularly evident in the areas of
                            pacification program planning, rural reconstruction, labor relations,
                            land reform. But this is but a first step. New programs must be
                            implemented, enlarged, and sustained over the long run. The capabilites
                            of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to perform well here have yet
                            to be proven. Its appeal and ties with the people, especially the
                            peasantry, remain tenuous.</p>
                        <p>At the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> working level, the picture
                            continues to be a dismal one of too much corruption, too little
                            motivation. At the grass-roots level there continues to be decreasing
                            effectiveness of local government. However, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, supported by <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>
                            personally, is giving renewed attention to this critical problem.
                            Moreover, USAID efforts to improve the flow of funds to rural
                            construction operations appear to be having positive results. It is the
                            Mission intention, of course, to see that this attitude and trend
                            continue and improve.</p>
                        <p>The most critical immediate problem is the inflation which could undo the
                            good effects of all our programs. This is being tackled vigorously not
                            only on the monetary front, but by increasing the supplies of essential
                            goods to areas outside of Saigon. Another critical problem, one that
                            does not come through a program-by-program report, is the growing
                            scarcity of manpower and materials in Vietnam. This is a matter calling
                            for a comprehensive program review both here in Washington and in
                            Saigon. You will be hearing more on this subject shortly.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>In the interview which you graciously accorded me at the end of May you
                            repeated anew your firm intention to seek assiduously a negotiated
                            solution for the conflict in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>In the hope of being able to assist in the realization of this noble
                            purpose, I bring to your attention the following:</p>
                        <p>On Thursday, November 11, in Hanoi, <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi
                                Minh</persName> and the President of the Council, Van Dong,
                            expressed to two persons (known to me) the strong desire to find a
                            peaceful solution to the conflict in Vietnam and, in summary,
                            stated—according to what they wrote me—that “in order for the peace
                            negotiations to come about, there will be necessary (a) a cease-fire (by
                            air, by sea, by land) in the entire territory of Vietnam (north and
                            south); the cessation, that is, of all belligerent operations (including
                            therefore also the cessation of debarkation of further American troops);
                            (b) a declaration according to which the Geneva Agreements of 1954 will
                            be taken as the basis for the negotiations—a declaration made up of the
                            four points formulated by Hanoi, points that are in reality the
                            explanation of the Geneva text and which, therefore, can be reduced to a
                            single point: application in other words, of the Geneva Accords.”</p>
                        <p>The text of the communication which I have received adds that “the
                            Government in Hanoi is prepared to initiate negotiations without first
                            requiring actual withdrawal of the American troops.”</p>
                        <p>To the same interlocutors <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi
                                Minh</persName> said: “I am prepared to go anywhere; to meet
                            anyone.”</p>
                        <p>These are the essential points that one of the two interlocutors of
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> and Van Dong sent
                            me in writing last night and which, in this letter of mine—confided to
                            Mr. A. Goldberg, the US representative to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, so that he can deliver it promptly and confidentially—I
                            bring word for word to your attention.</p>
                        <p>You surely have other elements by which to judge the importance of the
                            above. As President of the 20th Assembly, as a high official of Italy,
                            as a sincere friend of the United States and of yourself, I hope that
                            this contribution to the sought-for peaceful solution, always more
                            necessary and more urgent, may be a useful one. And I am at your
                            disposition for any step that you consider opportune in the matter.</p>
                        <p>With sincere pleasure at your recovery and with best wishes for your high
                            mission, I send my respectful greetings.</p>
                        <p>Yours,</p>

                        <p>As we read the message, it represents a simple restatement of the
                            familiar Hanoi position. Although worded in the most palatable form
                            possible, the second of the stated requirements for peace negotiations
                            amounts simply to our accepting in principle the familiar Hanoi four
                            points, the third of which required the establishment, under the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> program, of an immediate coalition
                            government in Saigon in which the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>
                            would play a leading and probably dominant role. We have never accepted
                            this as a basis for negotiations, and never could without surrendering
                            the most crucial of our objectives.</p>
                        <p>The language about a “cease-fire” has never been expressed in quite this
                            way before, but would amount to an immediate ban on our air operations
                            in the North and on our continuing ground reinforcements, without any
                            compensating act by Hanoi whatever in the form of stopping infiltration,
                            reducing activity in the South, and withdrawing at least regular units.
                            As you know, we have repeatedly told Hanoi through third parties that we
                            cannot consider even stopping the bombing without compensating action in
                            these three areas, and we have in effect said the same thing publicly in
                            more general form.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, the message in substance adds up to a reiteration of a firm
                            and inflexible Hanoi position consistent with all our other readings. It
                            corresponds closely with what several third parties have told us of the
                            position asserted by <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho</persName> and Pham
                            Van Dong, and also with Hanoi's most recent public statements. The only
                            possible glimmer of light is that Hanoi would not insist on prior
                            withdrawal of US forces—but this too we have long believed they would
                            not press for in the last analysis, and a similar statement was conveyed
                            to us explicitly when the North Vietnamese approached the French just at
                            the end of the pause last May.<note n="2" xml:id="d205fn2">See vol. II,

                            sources should be in a position to indicate, on the basis of a report
                            which Fanfani might make to them, that there is some new light or some
                            change in the unacceptable elements, which in effect amount to a

                        <p>McN said he had talked to the President about one aspect without
                            consulting B because McN felt he knew how B stood. The Chiefs have been
                            coming to a boiling point on bombing Haiphong. McN felt it would be wise
                            to insure that Chiefs' views got to the President if <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> saw the President. <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> saw the President the day
                            before the [he?] left. <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>
                            got the impression from the President he favored bombing (<gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>?) and asked that Wheeler and McN come
                            forward with a joint recommendation. McN said that he had briefly warned
                            the President not to do it at this time. However, because of this
                            feeling, McN thought he had better talk to the President himself. McN
                            told the President on his own long-run program it would be some time in
                            February and didn't see any objection in bringing it forward at the
                            present time. He told him he knew State felt strongly opposed; that he
                            thought McG leaned against it; and that he (McN) was not prepared to
                            recommend it at this time. He didn't feel strongly about changing it
                            from February to December. Said he would be willing to wait until Rusk's
                            return, at which time they would discuss it. McN said that he did not
                            tell the President his own recommendation—<pb n="580" xml:id="pg_580" facs="0612"/>an installation of four to six weeks, with several
                            bridges (7-9) and let them hit four of them, plus the surface-to-air
                            missile support facilities. B replied that he would look at this with
                                <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName>.</p>
                        <p>McN continued we have to decide what to do in Phase II. He believes we
                            should put the troop strength and financial requirements into our
                            budget; and, assuming the President does not want to make a firm
                            commitment to the end of Phase II, we should begin shipping the troops
                            in the battalion against that schedule in January, without commitment to
                            go beyond a month—unless the President wants to make a stronger
                            recommendation. B replied that this was his interpretation. McN said on
                            this basis, he would be stopping in Saigon on his way back from
                                Paris.<note n="2" xml:id="d206fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> was in Paris for
                                the November 27 meeting of the Special Committee of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Defense Ministers. He was in
                                Saigon November 28-29. For <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s recommendations to the President after
                                his trip to Saigon, see <ref target="#d212">Document
                                212</ref>.</note> He had spoken briefly to the Secretary on this
                            before he left. He was in favor; and the President is in favor of it.
                            McN said he didn't know when we wanted to get <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> back; since we face the decision
                            to make it would be helpful to sit down with <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>. The President doesn't
                            want a Honolulu meeting or <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> both in
                            Washington at the same time. For this reason, the best substitute would
                            be for McN to visit Saigon on the way home. He would plan to be there 24
                            hours. This raises the problem of transportation. Does B want him to
                            send a plane to pick him up in Paris? B replied that he would plan to go
                            to Paris with McN (from London) and from there come back to Washington
                            commercially.</p>
                        <p>McN asked if B wanted to meet tomorrow or Thursday to talk about our
                            approach to Wilson. B replied this could perhaps be done on the plane
                            going over. However, he is available should McN wish to do it before
                            that. McN replied they could decide this tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>McN said he would draft a cable to <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> telling him of his plans; would let B see it

                        <p>This is such an important question that I think you may want to look at
                            it once again. Bob McNamara and I have the impression that your mind is
                            settling against a pause, but we both believe that the matter is too
                            important to be decided without making sure that the question has been
                            explored to your satisfaction. I have mentioned our concern to Dean Rusk
                            and while he is still against a pause at present, he has encouraged me
                            to raise the matter with you once more.</p>
                        <p>On November 17 I sent forward a memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName> to you<note n="2" xml:id="d208fn2">For the covering memorandum, see <ref target="#d202">Document 202</ref>.</note> which outlined a
                            scenario for a pause, and gave the pros and cons. The scenario is out of
                            date, but the pros and cons are still pretty solid, and I attach them at
                            Tab A, together with the conclusions and recommendations then reached by
                            the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State.</p>
                        <p>In the last ten days, one or two additional considerations have
                            developed.</p>
                        <p>First, the Sevareid episode,<note n="3" xml:id="d208fn3">See <ref target="#d208fn2">footnote 2</ref>, <ref target="#d203">Document
                                    203</ref>.</note> rightly or wrongly, has strengthened the
                            impression among critics at home that we have not gone the full distance
                            in seeking negotiations. There is now increased value in proving our
                            good faith by a new pause.</p>

                                forces. On November 14, the campaign culminated in a battle in the

                            strengthens the argument for one further demonstration that our
                            determination to seek peace is equal to our determination on the

                            that the alarming figure he mentioned at the Ranch may turn out to be an
                            understatement. Thus the argument for preceding that budget request by
                            one or more peaceful effort is strengthened.</p>
                        <p>Fourth, there is growing evidence that we can count on quiet but strong
                            Soviet diplomatic support in pushing Hanoi toward the conference table
                            during another pause. At the minimum, a pause will certainly intensify
                            dissension between Peking and Moscow, with Hanoi in the middle. Moreover
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said to me that they
                            were thinking of a pause of only 12-21 days.<note n="5" xml:id="d208fn5">The last sentence of the paragraph is in Bundy's handwriting. He is
                                referring to a conversation with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on November 24. In a November 24 memorandum
                                to the President, Bundy described the conversation as “the most
                                candid and cordial conversation of our three-year acquaintance.”
                                Bundy related that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                                “expressed again the well-known Soviet view that a renewed and
                                longer pause would be helpful.” <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> suggested a pause of 12 to 20 days to allow
                                for intense diplomatic effort, but offered no advance assurances of
                                the results of such discussions. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> repeated the observation that it was
                                impossible for North Vietnam to negotiate while under U.S.
                                bombardment. (Johnson Library, National Security File, Files of

                            to me substantially stronger than they were two weeks ago, and on
                            balance my own judgment has shifted over toward <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. I think that any pause
                            should be very hard-nosed, and we should expect that it will not lead to
                            negotiations, but it will strengthen your hand both at home and abroad
                            as a determined man of peace facing a very tough course in 1966. It is
                            quite true, as I have argued before, that the bombing is <pb n="584" xml:id="pg_584" facs="0616"/>not what started the trouble, but it is
                            also true that we have a great interest in proving our own good faith as
                            peace lovers.</p>
                        <p>I also think that the diplomatic risks can be minimized by firmness and
                            clarity about what we are doing, and that hardline criticism at home can
                            be answered by what is done after the pause ends.</p>

                        <p rend="center">PROS AND CONS</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Pros</p>
                        <p>The principal arguments for a pause are:</p>
                        <p>1. A pause could lead to either successful negotiations or a tapering off
                            of military action in South Viet-Nam. Although the odds of this
                            happening at this time may be long, the stake is high enough to justify
                            the risks involved. It seems quite clear that the other side does not
                            believe it can agree to negotiations or a cessation of military action
                            while the bombing continues and we cannot know whether or not they
                            desire a settlement until we try them out by a pause. Even if this pause
                            does not bring about the desired result, it can set the stage for a
                            later pause which may bring the desired result.</p>
                        <p>2. The President's offer of unconditional negotiations greatly
                            strengthened our position throughout the world. A pause can have a
                            similar effect by taking away from the other side the one valid argument
                            they have against negotiations.</p>
                        <p>3. American casualties are mounting and further involvement appears
                            likely. A pause can demonstrate that the President has taken <pb n="585" xml:id="pg_585" facs="0617"/>every possible means to find a peaceful
                            solution and obtain domestic support for the further actions that we
                            will have to take.</p>
                        <p>4. There are already signs of dissension between Moscow, Peking, Hanoi
                            and the Viet Cong. The pause is certain to stimulate further dissension
                            on the other side and add to the strains in the Communist camp as they
                            argue about how to deal with it.</p>
                        <p>5. A pause could reduce the likelihood of further Soviet involvement. It
                            would not only help to convince Moscow that we genuinely desire a
                            settlement but would also decrease the ability of Hanoi or Peking to
                            bring pressure upon the Soviet Union for escalating their support.</p>
                        <p>6. Judging by experience during the last war, the resumption of bombing
                            after a pause would be even more painful to the population of North
                            Viet-Nam than a fairly steady rate of bombing.</p>
                        <p>7. The resumption of bombing after a pause, combined with increased
                            United States deployments in the South, would remove any doubts the
                            other side may have about U.S. determination to stay the course and
                            finish the job.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Cons</p>
                        <p>The principal arguments against a pause are:</p>
                        <p>1. Although Hanoi has repeatedly stated that it cannot “negotiate” as
                            long as the bombing goes on, there is no indication whatever from Hanoi
                            that a pause would lead to meaningful negotiations or actions. Hanoi's
                            continued military reinforcement of the South, plus what Hanoi
                            undoubtedly considers a still weak security and political situation in
                            the South, add up to what appears to be a very small chance that a pause
                            would produce a constructive response.</p>
                        <p>2. Hanoi's objective with respect to the bombing is not a “pause,” but
                            rather a complete cessation. They could be expected to do all in their
                            power to exploit a pause, not to move toward an acceptable settlement,
                            but to prevent our resumption of bombing and cause us to lose the one
                            card that we have which offers any hope of a settlement that does more
                            than reflect the balance of forces on the ground in the South.</p>
                        <p>3. Regardless of any resolve we have made beforehand, a unilateral pause
                            at this time would give Hanoi an excellent chance to interpose obstacles
                            to our resumption of bombing and to demoralize South Viet-Nam by
                            indefinitely dangling before us (and the world) the prospect of
                            negotiations with no intent of reaching an acceptable settlement. For
                            example, they could offer to enter into negotiations on condition that
                            the bombing not be resumed and that the Viet Cong be seated at the
                            conference on a basis of full equality with the Government of Viet-Nam.
                            As it would not be possible to accept this latter condition, they could
                            place us in the position of having resumed the bombing over a
                            “procedural” question with respect to a conference. Thus, in the absence
                            of any expression <pb n="586" xml:id="pg_586" facs="0618"/>of interest
                            or intent on their part to move toward a settlement that we would find
                            satisfactory, the other side could at this time use a pause to reverse
                            the present international situation, which is very favorable to us.</p>
                        <p>4. There is danger that, in spite of any steps we may take to offset it,
                            Hanoi may misread a pause at this time as indicating that we are giving
                            way to international and domestic pressures to stop the bombing of North
                            Viet-Nam and that our resolve with respect to South Viet-Nam is thus
                            weakening.</p>
                        <p>5. Resumption of the bombing following a pause of considerable duration
                            would assume a much more dramatic character than otherwise and could
                            present the Soviets with those difficult choices that we have heretofore
                            been successful in avoiding presenting to them.</p>
                        <p>6. Apart from the foregoing considerations, it will at this time be very
                            difficult to obtain <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> acquiescence to
                            a pause and could adversely affect the tenuous stability of the present
                            government. Any overturn of the present government in South Viet-Nam
                            could set us back very severely. Even if we obtained the acquiescence of
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, it would be very difficult to
                            obtain their continued cooperation, particularly in public statements,
                            throughout the duration of the pause.</p>

                        <p rend="center">CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of Defense believes that a pause, with the associated
                            obvious efforts to bring the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to a
                            settlement, should be carried out. His main reason is (1) to lay a
                            foundation, especially in the minds of the American people and of our
                            allies, for the increased U.S. deployments, casualties, costs and risks
                            that are in prospect. He believes also (2) that a pause now has a bare
                            chance of starting a chain reaction toward a settlement. He thinks that,
                            before intensifying the military confrontation and risks in Viet-Nam,
                            the United States should make every effort to back the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> down
                            by other means.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the Secretary of Defense believes (3) that, even if a pause
                            does not produce the full result this time, it would contribute toward a
                            settlement later—that the “tacit bargaining” process with the Communists
                            will probably involve several stages before the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> sights are brought
                            down to a “settlement level” and that a pause now, even if the bombing
                            must be resumed, will contribute to that end.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State feels the balance of arguments is against
                            undertaking a pause at the present time and that a pause should be
                            considered only at such times as the chances appear to be greater than
                            they now seem that it would lead in the direction of a peaceful
                            settlement acceptable to us.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State thus recommends that we continue our discussions
                            with the other side through all possible channels, particularly <pb n="587" xml:id="pg_587" facs="0619"/>exploring “what would happen”
                            if there is a pause in the bombing. If such probes at any time give firm
                            indications of a response by specific and acceptable actions on the part
                            of Hanoi, a pause should then be undertaken. This is also entirely
                            consistent with our public position and maintains what he feels is our
                            present favorable international posture.</p>

                        <p>Several representatives of the American Friends Service Committee called

                                Van Bo</persName>, <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> commercial
                            representative. This conversation suggested that the North Vietnamese
                            position is considerably more flexible than we have heretofore been led
                            to believe; it is of course difficult to evaluate how much was being
                            said for the benefit of an American group which does not support the war
                            in Viet Nam and how much represents approved <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> policy.</p>
                        <p>The following are the principal points made by <persName corresp="#p_MVBR1">Mai Van Bo</persName> in the Paris conversation
                            (a full account is in course of preparation):<note n="3" xml:id="d210fn3">See <ref target="#d211">Document 211</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_MVBR1">Mai Van Bo</persName> accepted that the
                            United States for reasons of face could not accept North Viet-Nam's four
                            points and said that all that would be required to open the way to
                            negotiations would be a clear statement by the United States in support
                            of the principles of the Geneva Accords of 1954.</p>
                        <p>2. The withdrawal of American forces is not a prerequisite to
                            negotiations; all that is required is a U.S. statement accepting the
                            principle of withdrawal of US forces, presumably eventually.</p>
                        <p>3. The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> will not agree to a ceasefire.
                            Mr. Schneider also did not remember any reference to a cessation of the
                            U.S. bombing of the North.<note n="4" xml:id="d210fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_MVBR1">Mai Van Bo</persName> also mentioned
                                the possibility, instead of a ceasefire, of a mutual de-escalation
                                of military actions but did not indicate how this might be brought
                                about.” [Footnote in the source text.]</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MVBR1">Mai Van Bo</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> was prepared to make an important
                            concession in that it was ready to accept the existence of two separate
                            Viet-Nams, with South Viet-Nam as an independent country.</p>
                        <p>5. The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> is prepared to talk with the
                            U.S. but not with the Government in Saigon. On the other hand there are
                            acceptable individuals outside the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>
                            (and possibly including some people presently in the Government) who
                            could constitute a group which could be represented in the negotiations.
                            Interestingly, <persName corresp="#p_MVBR1">Mai Van Bo</persName> stated
                            that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would have been prepared to
                            negotiate with the Diem Government but it does not recognize its
                            successors as governments.</p>
                        <pb n="589" xml:id="pg_589" facs="0621"/>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_MVBR1">Mai Van Bo</persName> said nothing about
                            next steps. In answer to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>'s question, the Friends left open the possibility of
                            their carrying the dialogue farther forward, although this point was not
                            pursued.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_AFSC1">AFSC</gloss> called on <persName corresp="#p_MVBR1">Mai Van Bo</persName> for the purpose of asking
                            whether North Viet Nam would permit the Friends to carry on
                            humanitarian, civilian relief activities there. <persName corresp="#p_MVBR1">Mai Van Bo</persName>'s answer on this is being
                            awaited. The Friends realize of course that there would be questions
                            about licensing goods to go to North Viet Nam and validation of
                            passports for any American Friends who would wish to participate.</p>

                                Bo</persName> had made the following comments to him during the
                            course of a conversation on November 16 in Paris on the possibility of
                            the American Friends Service Committee's giving assistance to the people
                            of North Viet-Nam:</p>
                        <p>(a) It might be difficult for the US to accept Pham Van Dong's four
                            points as a basis for negotiations as it would entail a loss of face. Bo
                            suggested that a U.S. declaration of agreement with the principles of
                            the <pb n="590" xml:id="pg_590" facs="0622"/>Geneva Accords would be
                            satisfactory to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> Government as a
                            basis for negotiations. In response to Mr. Schneider's question, Bo said
                            that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would not demand the
                            withdrawal of American forces as a precondition to negotiations but
                            would require that the US declare its agreement in principle to their
                            eventual withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>(b) Schneider raised the question of a ceasefire. Bo said that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would not agree to a ceasefire before
                            negotiations began but gave the impression that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would agree to some sort of
                            de-escalation.</p>
                        <p>(c) Bo said that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would not
                            negotiate with the present Saigon regime, although it would have
                            negotiated with the Diem Government. The successors to the Diem
                            Government were not representative. However, there were many good people
                            in South Viet-Nam, within and outside the National Liberation Front,
                            from whom a group could be formed with which the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would negotiate. It was Mr. Schneider's impression that
                            Bo might even have been suggesting that the US form such a group. (In
                            response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>'s question,
                            Mr. Schneider said Bo mentioned no names but did mention some
                            categories, including the Buddhists. He would check on what the other
                            categories were.)</p>
                        <p>(d) Bo said that the DRV was prepared to accept the existence of an
                            independent South Viet-Nam, although they knew that this would not be in
                            accordance with the Geneva Accords.</p>
                        <p>(e) Mr. Schneider raised the question of an international body to
                            guarantee a settlement. Bo volunteered the thought that the best
                            international supervisory body might be a revitalized International
                            Control Commission.</p>
                        <p>(f) Bo said that the North Vietnamese were fighting for their
                            independence. They knew what colonialism was like, as they had been
                            fighting against it for a thousand years. Bo made no specific mention of
                            either the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>'s
                            questions, Mr. Schneider stated that he thought that Bo was anxious to
                            pass these thoughts on to an American and believed that Schneider would
                            forward them to the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. Bo said
                            nothing, however, about what steps could be taken by the US to follow up
                            on these statements, beyond his proposal that we declare our agreement
                            with the principles of the Geneva Accords and our acceptance of eventual
                            withdrawal of American forces. In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>'s specific question on whether the
                            Friends would carry the dialogue further with Bo, Dr. White said that
                            the Friends would try to be of assistance in any humanitarian way
                            possible. They would prefer not to allow their involvement in political
                            questions prejudice the success of their non-political, strictly
                            humanitarian efforts, however. In response to further questions, Mr.
                            Schneider said that Bo did not mention how de-escalation could be
                            achieved, any connection between US bombing of North Viet-Nam and
                            negotiations, or how the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> assesses
                            the protest movement in <pb n="591" xml:id="pg_591" facs="0623"/>the
                            United States (beyond his remarks on Norman Morrison). Mr. Schneider
                            thought Bo understood well the fact that the <gloss target="#t_AFSC1">AFSC</gloss> was appealing to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> as well as to the US to find a solution to the
                            conflict.</p>
                        <p>3. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> thanked Mr. Schneider
                            for passing on this information, remarking that some of it represented a
                            change from previous <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> statements we
                            had heard.</p>

                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Introductory comments</hi>. Before giving my
                            assessment of the situation and recommendations, I want to report that
                            United States personnel in Vietnam are performing admirably. The massive
                            Cam Ranh Bay complex has sprung into operation since our last visit in
                            July; the troops that we visited (the 173d Airborne Brigade and the 1st
                            Cavalry Division) have fought and are fighting well and their morale is
                            high; and the team in Saigon is working harmoniously.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The situation</hi>. There has been no substantial
                            change since my November 3 memorandum in the economic, political or
                            pacification situation. There is a serious threat of inflation because
                            of the mixture of US force build-up and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> deficit on the one hand and the tightly stretched
                            Vietnamese economy on the other; the <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> “government of generals” is surviving, but not
                            acquiring wide support or generating actions; pacification is thoroughly
                            stalled, with no guarantee that security anywhere is <pb n="592" xml:id="pg_592" facs="0624"/>permanent and no indications that able
                            and willing leadership will emerge in the absence of that permanent
                            security. (Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>
                            estimates his government controls only 25% of the population today and
                            reports that his pacification chief hopes to increase that to 50% two
                            years from now.)</p>
                        <p>The dramatic recent changes in the situation are on the military side.
                            They are the increased infiltration from the North and the increased
                            willingness of the Communist forces to stand and fight, even in
                            large-scale engagements. The Ia Drang River Campaign of early November
                            is an example. The Communists appear to have decided to increase their
                            forces in South Vietnam both by heavy recruitment in the South
                            (especially in the Delta) and by infiltration of regular North
                            Vietnamese forces from the North. Nine regular North Vietnamese
                            regiments (27 infantry battalions) have been infiltrated in the past
                            year, joining the estimated 83 <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            battalions in the South. The rate of infiltration has increased from
                            three battalion equivalents a month in late 1964 to a high of 9 or 12
                            during one month this past fall. General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> estimates that through 1966 North Vietnam
                            will have the capability to expand its armed forces in order to
                            infiltrate three regiments (nine battalion equivalents, or 4500 men) a
                            month, and that the VC in South Vietnam can train seven new battalion
                            equivalents a month—together adding 16 battalion equivalents a month to
                            the enemy forces. Communist casualties and desertions can be expected to
                            go up if my recommendations for increased US, South Vietnamese and third
                            country forces are accepted. Nevertheless, the enemy can be expected to
                            enlarge his present strength of 110 battalion equivalents to more than
                            150 battalion equivalents by the end of calendar 1966, when hopefully
                            his losses can be made to equal his input.</p>
                        <p>As for the Communist ability to supply this force, it is estimated that,
                            even taking account of interdiction of routes by air and sea, more than
                            200 tons of supplies a day can be infiltrated—more than enough, allowing
                            for the extent to which the enemy lives off the land, to support the
                            likely <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> force at the likely level of operations.</p>
                        <p>To meet this possible—and in my view likely—Communist build-up, the
                            presently contemplated Phase I forces will not be enough. Phase I
                            forces, almost all in place by the end of this year, involve 130 South
                            Vietnamese, 9 Korean, 1 Australian and 34 US combat battalions
                            (approximately 220,000 Americans). Bearing in mind the nature of the
                            war, the expected weighted combat force ratio of less than 2-to-1 will
                            not be good enough. Nor will the originally contemplated Phase II
                            addition of 28 more US battalions (112,000 men) be enough; the combat
                            force ratio, even with 32 new South Vietnamese battalions, would still
                            be little better than 2-to-1 at the end of 1966. The initiative which we
                            have held since August would pass to the enemy; we would fall far short
                            of what we expected to achieve in terms of population control and
                            disruption of <pb n="593" xml:id="pg_593" facs="0625"/>enemy bases and
                            lines of communications. Indeed, it is estimated that, with the
                            contemplated Phase II addition of 28 US battalions, we would be able
                            only to hold our present geographical positions.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Military options and recommendations</hi>. We have
                            but two options, it seems to me. One is to go now for a compromise
                            solution (something substantially less than the “favorable outcome” I
                            described in my memorandum of November 3), and hold further deployments
                            to a minimum. The other is to stick with our stated objectives and with
                            the war, and provide what it takes in men and materiel. If it is decided
                            not to move now toward a compromise, I recommend that the United States
                            both send a substantial number of additional troops and very gradually
                            intensify the bombing of North Vietnam. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>, General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAUSG1">Sharp</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> concur in this pronged
                            course of action, although General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAUSG1">Sharp</persName> would intensify the bombing of the North more
                            quickly.</p>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">Troop deployments</hi>. With respect to additional
                            forces in South Vietnam to maintain the initiative against the growing
                            Communist forces, I recommend:</p>
                        <p>1. That the Republic of Korea be requested to increase their present
                            deployment of nine combat battalions to 18 combat battalions (the
                            addition of one division) before July 1966 and to 21 combat battalions
                            (the addition of another brigade) before October 1966.</p>
                        <p>2. That the Government of Australia be requested to increase their
                            present deployment of one combat battalion to two combat battalions
                            before October 1966.</p>
                        <p>3. That the deployment of US ground troops be increased by the end of
                            1966 from 34 combat battalions to 74 combat battalions.</p>
                        <p>4. That the FY '67 Budget for the Defense Department and the January
                            Supplement to the FY '66 Budget be revised to reflect the expansion of
                            US forces required to support the additional deployments.</p>
                        <p>The 74 US battalions—together with increases in air squadrons, naval
                            units, air defense, combat support, construction units and miscellaneous
                            logistic support and advisory personnel which I also recommend—would
                            bring the total US personnel in Vietnam to approximately 400,000 by the
                            end of 1966. And it should be understood that further deployments
                            (perhaps exceeding 200,000) may be needed in 1967.</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Bombing of North Vietnam</hi>. With respect to the
                            program of bombing North Vietnam, I recommend that we maintain present
                            levels of activity in the three quadrants west and south of Hanoi, but
                            that over a period of the next six months we gradually enlarge the
                            target system in the northeast (Hanoi-Haiphong) quadrant until, at the
                            end of the period, it includes “controlled” armed reconnaissance of
                            lines of communication throughout the area, bombing of petroleum storage
                            facilities and power plants, and mining of the harbors. (Left unstruck
                            would be population targets, industrial plants, locks and dams.)</p>
                        <pb n="594" xml:id="pg_594" facs="0626"/>
                        <p>4. Pause in bombing North Vietnam. It is my belief that there should be a
                            three- or four-week pause in the program of bombing the North before we
                            either greatly increase our troop deployments to Vietnam or intensify

                                text.]</note> The reasons for this belief are, first, that we must
                            lay a foundation in the mind of the American public and in world opinion
                            for such an enlarged phase of the war and, second, we should give North
                            Vietnam a face-saving chance to stop the aggression. I am not seriously
                            concerned about the risk of alienating the South Vietnamese, misleading
                            Hanoi, or being “trapped” in a pause; if we take reasonable precautions,
                            we can avoid these pitfalls. I am seriously concerned about embarking on
                            a markedly higher level of war in Vietnam without having tried, through
                            a pause, to end the war or at least having made it clear to our people
                            that we did our best to end it.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Evaluation.</hi> We should be aware that deployments
                            of the kind I have recommended will not guarantee success. US
                            killed-in-action can be expected to reach 1000 a month, and the odds are
                            even that we will be faced in early 1967 with a “no-decision” at an even
                            higher level. My overall evaluation, nevertheless, is that the best
                            chance of achieving our stated objectives lies in a pause followed, if
                            it fails, by the deployments mentioned above.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss> 65799. We have been talking about
                            Vietnam deployment recommendations for an hour this afternoon, and think
                            the following preliminary thoughts are worth reporting.</p>
                        <p>We accept for planning that Westmoreland's deployment recommendations
                            should be approved and that in all probability these deployments <pb n="595" xml:id="pg_595" facs="0627"/>will take place in 1966. We do
                            not see any good way of second-guessing <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, although we can have a whack if you ask us
                            to.</p>
                        <p>On this assumption, the December decisions seem to fall in four
                            categories:</p>
                        <p>1. Proving that we have done everything that we could to move toward
                            peace;</p>
                        <p>2. Preparing a solid base for the chosen level of later military
                            action;</p>
                        <p>3. Building advance consensus for the probable budgetary
                            consequences;</p>
                        <p>4. Balancing the size and energy of <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>'s effort by action to the limit on the
                            political, social and economic front in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Our preliminary thoughts on each of these follow:</p>
                        <p>1. Efforts for peace. We see four broad general possibilities here.</p>
                        <p>(1) First and most narrowly, we could make a high-level official gesture
                            to Hanoi proposing unconditional discussions at any one of a number of
                            fixed times and dates and places. One way of doing this would be to send
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> to Paris to speak to
                            Bo, since Bo is the most visible representative of Hanoi in the West,
                            and <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> is your most
                            distinguished envoy of peace. We think this should probably be done
                            privately for later surfacing. But it could also be publicly announced
                            if that seemed better. Even if Hanoi unyielding, you will have made
                            specific dramatic effort before Congress returns. Other simultaneous
                            messages to appropriate capitals should be going on during this
                            effort.</p>
                        <p>(2) You can have a pause in bombing the north. <persName corresp="#p_CJA1">Califano</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Moyers</persName> think any such pause should
                            probably be very brief, while Bundy shares <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s feeling that if we do, it should have a
                            length of 3-4 weeks for international reasons. We all agree that such a
                            pause should be quite hard-nosed. We would make it very clear that we
                            were doing it to see whether there would be a response, and that in the
                            absence of a response we would keep a fully free hand. One strong
                            argument for a pause is that we all expect that it will be necessary to
                            intensify the bombing substantially in 1966, and we will need to have
                            shown that this is the fault of others.</p>
                        <p>(3) We are in the Christmas season, and it is possible that you could
                            declare a Christmas armistice or ceasefire on a still wider basis, both
                            in the north and in the south. Such a moment of peace could be as short
                            as Christmas day, or as long as three weeks, depending on the balance of
                            advantages and disadvantages. There are real difficulties with this
                            course in South Vietnam, but it has a certain Johnsonian scale. During
                            such a pause our men would of course be free to defend themselves and to
                            reply sharply to any particular attack.</p>
                        <p>(4) Our diplomatic position on the Geneva Accords and free elections and
                            the eventual future of Vietnam still lacks sharpness and punch. <pb n="596" xml:id="pg_596" facs="0628"/>We think you should insist on a
                            wholly new level of directness and definition in our peace aims for your
                            State of the Union message.</p>
                        <p>2. Preparations for next military courses.</p>
                        <p>(1) Our principal preliminary thought here is that you might call
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> back to consult
                            with you. The deepest domestic danger we see is from those who will
                            charge us with a no-win policy, and our best protection is that you and
                            the responsible commander are on all fours. Moreover, we all feel that
                            reading <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> through
                            other men's eyes—even the eyes of <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>—is not good enough for a Commander-in-Chief
                            facing the decisions that are now before you. Understanding between you
                            and <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> will also help
                            in insuring that the Chiefs stay with us. Only <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> himself among them is as broad
                            gauged as <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>.</p>
                        <p>(2) December should also include contingent decisions to make <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>'s deployments and
                            probably to intensify bombing in the north in 1966, unless peace breaks
                            out. Such preliminary decisions would help keep the Chiefs and other
                            military on board during any pause or ceasefire or diplomatic peace
                            offensive.</p>
                        <p>(3) We would side strongly with <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>—and might even go beyond him—in avoiding any
                            reserve call-up or other action not immediately required to meet
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>'s needs. In
                            other words, we would carry forward the principle of minimum necessary
                            action which you laid down in July.</p>
                        <p>3. Preparing the country for the FY-66 supplemental and the FY-67
                            budget.</p>
                        <p>(1) During this month, the military budget, as well as the civilian one,
                            must be pushed down as far as is consistent with both your basic
                            programs and your ability to withstand charges of concealment. In this
                            connection we are exploring the manner in which the Korean war was
                            financed by Truman.</p>
                        <p>(2) As your budgetary decisions become clearer, more of the advance
                            background notices of the kind <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Moyers</persName> gave last week could be released to selected
                            elements of the press.</p>
                        <p>(3) We should get the Business Council to support your budget and any
                            related actions we take as noninflationary, and we should get the top
                            labor leaders to keep the labor movement within economic guidelines.</p>
                        <p>(4) Before you make any dramatic decisions related to tax increases or
                            even more drastic anti-inflationary steps, people like Heller should be
                            consulted, as well as your principal economic advisers.</p>
                        <p>Peace steps, military preparations and overall budgetary/economic
                            planning will require most careful orchestration and a gradually growing
                            process of public comment which we should turn our way just as far as
                            possible. It occurs to us that someone like David Ginsburg might be <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0629"/>called in to give full time to
                            this problem, so that we get the speeches and statements of support
                            which we want all across the spectrum of opinion from Tom Dewey to
                            Walter Reuther.</p>
                        <p>These are just our preliminary thoughts. You will clearly need close
                            consultation with Rusk and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> before these bridges are crossed, and we think
                            you may also need a chance to talk with more detached advisers like
                                <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Fortas</persName>. And as you approach final
                            decisions, you will also want to consult <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and the Congressional leadership.</p>

                            Rusk and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> have made
                            significant progress in clarifying their own thinking on Vietnam. So far
                            they have concentrated mainly on the actual course of war and diplomacy,
                            and have not yet got deeply into the critical questions of political
                            management which Joe and <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName> and
                            I opened in our message to you last night.<note n="3" xml:id="d214fn3">
                                <ref target="#d213">Document 213</ref>.</note> But I cannot disagree
                            with their judgment that it is important to sort out the military and
                            diplomatic priorities.</p>
                        <p>2. Today's discussions confirm the judgment that we shall almost surely
                            wish to proceed energetically on <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>'s course in South Vietnam. Thus all of us
                            believe that we should accept for planning purposes additional
                            deployments averaging fifteen thousand a month over the next year. It
                            does not follow that we should announce a large lump sum increase
                            anytime soon. Indeed our preliminary judgment is that steady increase of
                            pressure on the ground should be as undramatic as possible—and of course
                            should have as many third country battalions as <pb n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0630"/>we can get (separate paper from

                        <p>3. At the same time the two Secretaries do share increasing concern about
                            possible Chinese involvement. There will be a special briefing tomorrow

                            regard as survival of North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>4. The open question is the pause. The day's discussions here have
                            increased support for some form of pause. I will send a memo tomorrow
                            developing pros and cons further,<note n="6" xml:id="d214fn6">

                            short of it is that we think the international advantages outweigh the
                            international traps. We also think that firm and steady action in the
                            south, together with public awareness of Chinese Communist danger,
                            should keep most Americans in line with any decision you take on this
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>5. We have agreed to make assignments for detailed planning documents in
                            all relevant fields in a further meeting tomorrow morning,<note n="7" xml:id="d214fn7">These assignments were probably made at the

                            current intention to have all papers ready for discussion with you by

                            that we could fly to you on Tuesday if you wish. The controlling item in
                            urgency here is the pause, because it will require intensive diplomatic
                            preparation in more than one capital if it is to have minimum danger and
                            maximum benefit.</p>
                        <p>6. Meetings today have shown the Secretary of State at his best in the
                            leadership of a complex discussion with a small group he knows well. At
                            the direct request of the two Secretaries, <persName corresp="#p_CJA1">Califano</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Moyers</persName> have not been included in these meetings, but I
                            have told the Secretaries that I think it important to keep them both
                            fully informed of the course of discussion separately, and both
                            Secretaries have agreed. Both Joe and <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName> have a deep and penetrating understanding of your
                            immediate interest, and together the three of us will try to keep in
                            touch with all aspects of the matter from your point of view. But the
                            Secretary of State feels that he has a direct instruction from you to
                            operate this review and my judgment, in which <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Moyers</persName> concurs, is he should run it his
                            way unless you have other instructions.</p>

                        <p>1. I promised you yesterday a memorandum by this pouch on the pros and
                            cons of the pause as it now looks. This memorandum is a personal
                            assessment for your interim consideration. There should be a further
                            paper with fairly general support within the Administration by the end
                            of the day on Monday.<note n="2" xml:id="d215fn2">December 6; see <ref target="#d220">Document 220</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. The opinion in favor of a pause continues to grow here. This morning
                            there seems to be a favorable consensus among Rusk, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName>, the Bundy
                            brothers, and Tommy Thompson. We think this is the best single way of
                            keeping it clear that Johnson is for peace, while Ho is for war. This
                            has great advantages in balancing the further military deployments and
                            the big military budget. It has advantages with all third countries, and
                            perhaps particularly with the Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> points out that a pause would greatly
                            strengthen the Russian resolve to stand clear of our fighting in
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>3. The pause also has an important political advantage which has only
                            recently emerged in our discussions. If a pause should lead to the
                            conference table, it would mean that Hanoi had given up one of its
                            current conditions—which is the acceptance of the program of the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> (the Viet Cong). Thus such a move by
                            Hanoi would drive a sharp wedge between Hanoi and the Communists in
                            South Vietnam. We know that it is just this kind of sell-out that the
                            southern Communists fear. Thus, a pause which led to negotiations could
                            be strongly defended in Saigon and with hard-liners at home as a very
                            powerful instrument of attack on Viet Cong morale—since all of our
                            mounting pressures in the South would still continue. Moreover, we are
                            increasingly persuaded that there is no trap we cannot manage in
                            deciding when and how to end the pause. We would make it clear at every
                            stage that the continuation of the pause and its ending would both be
                            governed by our judgment on the continuing aggression from the North
                            against the South. (To put it another way, while a pause might lead to
                            negotiations, we would never commit ourselves to a permanent end of the
                            bombing merely in return for a conference.) Thus either the infiltration
                            would stop, or we would have a perfectly legitimate and internationally
                            defensible reason for renewed bombing at a time of our choice.</p>
                        <pb n="600" xml:id="pg_600" facs="0632"/>
                        <p>4. We are not agreed here on the timing of a pause. Most of us have
                            thought that it probably ought to happen in December and early January,
                            so that you could end it or not—as you chose—around the time of the
                            State of the Union message. But we now think that perhaps it could come
                            later—and might even be a balancing element in your military
                            announcements for the effort in South Vietnam in January. This needs
                            more thought.</p>
                        <p>5. The weaknesses of the pause are two—one international and one
                            domestic:</p>
                        <p>The international danger is that it would simply shift the propaganda of
                            soft-liners from the bombing to the need to recognize the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>. Our current line on this is fairly
                            good—that Hanoi can bring anyone it wants. But the pressure would grow
                            to give some more explicit recognition to people who “control one-half
                            the country.” This is exactly what we must not do if we do not wish to
                            lose the whole game in South Vietnam. But sooner or later we are going
                            to have to face this music, and perhaps it is not so bad to face it now
                            during a pause.</p>
                        <p>The domestic problem is more severe. The Joint Chiefs are now pressing
                            very hard for escalation of the bombing, and the whole American Right is
                            likely to be tempted by the argument that just at the moment of trial we
                            are weakening in our support for our men in Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> can make a very convincing
                            argument that the bombing in the North is only marginally related to the
                            fighting in the South—whether or not we escalate. But it is hard to get
                            certified military agreement to this proposition. Against this, of
                            course, we have the pronouncement of the National Council of Churches,
                            but it is far from clear that they really represent their
                                congregations.<note n="3" xml:id="d215fn3">On December 3, the
                                general board of the National Council of Churches in Madison,
                                Wisconsin, released a policy statement that noted with approval the
                                Johnson administration's commitment to unconditional discussions
                                with North Vietnam and its policy of not bombing population centers.
                                It also urged the President to take new initiatives in seeking peace
                                in Vietnam.</note>

                            will convey my views in detail to you at your meeting on Tuesday.<note n="3" xml:id="d216fn3">December 7; see <ref target="#d223">Document
                                    223</ref>.</note> However, I would like you to know that I
                            strongly favor an early pause in the bombing of North Vietnam, perhaps
                            for 3 or 4 weeks, with a new indication of our willingness to negotiate.
                            I come to this conclusion even though I realize that there is risk that
                            if a pause leads to negotiation it would be difficult to resume bombing
                            North Vietnam as long as those negotiations continued.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">My reasons are as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. If further escalation is in prospect, such a move would help
                            tremendously in carrying world opinion with us.</p>
                        <p>2. From my talks with the Secretary General and with many <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> delegations, I am convinced that such
                            action would be welcomed and strongly supported all over the world as
                            further confirmation of the earnestness and sincerity of the United
                            States' determination to leave no stone unturned in trying to move the
                            Vietnam problem from the battlefield to the conference table. A pause
                            would be a concrete act adding immense reality and weight to your
                            statements calling for unconditional discussions. Such a decision,
                            despite no positive signals from the other side, would be viewed as an
                            undisputed act of statesmanship, an act only a great and strong nation
                            could take.</p>
                        <p>3. The same is true as regards American domestic opinion. The recent
                            statement of the National Council of Churches is only one sign of
                            mounting concern among responsible citizens as a result of our increased
                            commitment of manpower and the additional American casualties being
                            incurred. A pause would increase the confidence and assurance of the
                            preponderant majority of the American people that while we <pb n="602" xml:id="pg_602" facs="0634"/>intend to honor our commitments in
                            Vietnam, you will exhaust every means to make our willingness to
                            negotiate unmistakably clear.</p>
                        <p>4. Such a proposal would put the Communists further to the test and would
                            intensify pressure on them to negotiate.</p>
                        <p>5. It would make it less difficult for the Soviets to abandon their
                            present passive attitude and actively to seek to bring Hanoi to the
                            conference table, even in the face of continued opposition from Peking.
                            At least it would offer hope of a more fruitful Soviet-American dialogue
                            on this subject.</p>
                        <p>6. It would place Hanoi and Peiping in a defensive position in relation
                            to the non-aligned world; it would reassure our friends and supporters
                            and reinforce their domestic position; it would restore the initiative
                            in this matter where it properly belongs, to the leader of the greatest
                            power in the world, the US.</p>
                        <p>The impact of such an announced pause would be enhanced if coupled with a
                            strong personal reaffirmation on your part of our willingness to go
                            anywhere, at any time, at any level, to negotiate. You might well link
                            this with a restatement of our peace aims in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>If you approve this course of action, I would strongly urge you to make
                            such an announcement in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General
                            Assembly, before the Assembly closes on December 21. This would have the
                            maximum dramatic effect and would be consistent with your desire to use
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to the utmost.</p>
                        <p>I have set forth these views of mine which I strongly hold in rather
                            brief and summary fashion, but I shall be very glad to elaborate upon
                            them if you so desire.</p>

                        <p>2024. Eyes only for Bundy.</p>
                        <p>1. Archbishop Palmas, the Apostolic Delegate, “bumped into” me at the
                            garden party last Sunday night celebrating the King of Thailand's
                            birthday and immediately brought up the matter of the Viet Cong wanting
                            to see me with regard to ending the war.<note n="2" xml:id="d217fn2">See
                                    <ref target="#d191">Document 191</ref>.</note> He said:</p>
                        <p>2. Just as he and I had surmised, it has taken them one month to consult
                            with each other. The “former Minister” had called on Palmas last
                            Wednesday or Thursday<note n="3" xml:id="d217fn3">December 1 or
                                2.</note> and had said:</p>
                        <p>3. The leaders of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> with whom he is
                            in touch had had a long discussion on just what their terms for ending
                            the war should be, and they have decided on three things:</p>
                        <p>4. First, the United States presence should remain in South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>5. Second, the United States would guarantee the sovereignty of South
                            Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>6. Third, there would be no negotiations with North Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>7. They also would send a man with “Ambassadorial” rank to see me who
                            would have the necessary letter of credentials.</p>
                        <p>8. Palmas added that his “former Minister” wept while talking about the
                            sufferings of the Viet Cong, and stressed the urgency of ending the war.
                            He also said there was great alarm among the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> about the entrance of the North Vietnamese troops into
                            South Viet-Nam. He implied that the Viet Cong in South Viet-Nam have the
                            same feelings about Hanoi that Hanoi has about Peking.</p>
                        <p>9. The “former Minister” also said, according to Palmas, that those who
                            say he and his friends are pro-French “should remember that it is we who
                            killed the French Vice Consul Bion.”</p>
                        <p>10. Palmas asked what I wanted to do when the “former Minister” came
                            again and asked whether I would receive him. I said I would like to know
                            what his name was before I could answer such a question, but that I
                            would certainly “make some arrangement.”</p>
                        <p>11. He asked me whether I would receive the representative of the Viet
                            Cong. I said that if he was of high rank—a true envoy
                                plenipotentiary—<pb n="604" xml:id="pg_604" facs="0636"/>that I
                            would talk with him but that I did not want to have them send a
                            subordinate official to talk with me. Palmas said that he had been
                            assured that they would send a man “with ambassadorial rank.”</p>
                        <p>12. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> This is a surprising development. I
                            suspect this is a splinter group who will not be able to end the war.
                            But it may presage a real split within the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. If they could end the war, then we could not possibly
                            ask for better terms. If I am in any doubt as to whether the so-called
                            representative is really senior or not, I will have an Embassy official
                            talk to him to verify that point. I am sure, however, that there is no
                            use in any American here other than me talking peace terms. Both my
                            Residence and that of the Apostolic Delegate are constantly watched, but
                            I think I can find a place which is not watched and where I can meet
                            this man.</p>

                        <p>1576. Literally eyes only for the Ambassador from the Secretary. I was
                            much interested in your Nodis 2024.<note n="2" xml:id="d219fn2">
                                <ref target="#d217">Document 217</ref>.</note> While one must be
                            skeptical for a lot of reasons, the possibility of any significant
                            defection from the liberation front has great potential importance. I
                            would suggest that you follow up along the lines of your telegram.</p>
                        <p>It may be that such a group is only a splinter. There would be great
                            advantage, however, if such a splinter had any territorial base which
                            opens up the possibility of a rapid peace in even two or three
                            provinces. Amnesty arrangements might be made and through full
                            cooperation with intelligence, police activities, etc., North Vietnamese
                            elements could be prevented from punishing the splinter group. Depending
                            upon the circumstances, some tacit understanding might even be thinkable
                            which would leave the splinter group certain privileges in a particular
                            area provided the writ of the government ran on other matters. I have in
                            mind the arrangements worked out with the two sects in the
                            Southwest.</p>
                        <p>You would have to be a little careful about a commitment not to negotiate
                            with Hanoi unless the dimensions of the breakaway are far greater than
                            you and we presently believe. In view of the public position of the
                            President, a commitment on negotiations would need checking with us.</p>
                        <p>I leave to your judgment the complex question as to when and whether
                            General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> ought to be informed
                            very privately of such a contact.<note n="3" xml:id="d219fn3">In

                            wonder if we are really ready for the meeting tomorrow.<note n="2" xml:id="d220fn2">See <ref target="#d223">Document 223</ref>.</note>
                            It is a fair question, and this message aims to answer it. In the
                            largest sense, we are not fully ready, but nevertheless there are
                            immediate decisions that cannot wait, and on these we believe we are
                            ready.</p>
                        <p>2. We do not have a complete and fully developed political, economic and
                            social program to match the major new military deployments proposed for
                            1966. We can and will develop such a program, but we have to understand
                            that unless and until there can be military victories, this program is
                            irrelevant. Moreover, we are making major non-military efforts now which
                            should produce results with victories, although they will come to
                            nothing without them.</p>
                        <p>3. A strengthened political and economic program can and will include
                            such items as the following:</p>
                        <p>A. New economic programs to prevent inflation.</p>
                        <p>B. Intensified countrywide health programs.</p>
                        <p>C. Highlighted educational efforts.</p>
                        <p>D. Stronger propaganda, including television.</p>
                        <p>E. Strengthened defector programs.</p>
                        <p>F. Establishment of model pacification districts and provinces.</p>
                        <p>G. Economic warfare denial program.</p>
                        <p>H. Streamlined organization for peace actions both in Saigon and in
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>I. Appointment of outstanding executives for peace in both capitals.</p>
                        <p>J. Redeveloped political action efforts leading toward strengthened
                            anti-Communist political organization and to pave the way for
                            elections.</p>
                        <p>K. Wider and stronger agricultural reform programs.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and company would say that
                            they are doing much of this now, but we all know it can be done better,
                            and in any event it should be a major part of your 1966 Vietnam
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>4. But with or without this stronger non-military program, we face major
                            immediate military and diplomatic decisions. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and the Chiefs are already
                            engaged in detailed planning for the additional deployments and
                            expenditures Westmoreland's program requires. Thus <pb n="608" xml:id="pg_608" facs="0640"/>the issues presented in the military

                            be decided this week.</p>
                        <p>5. We also have to decide now on a pause, if we are to have one before
                            January. Advocates and opponents of a pause agree that it must be about
                            three weeks in length to have any value. It is also agreed that it must
                            have preliminary diplomatic preparation in Saigon and other capitals if
                            it is not to backfire. We also agree that you should have freedom to end
                            the pause before Congress returns, if you wish. In combination, these
                            requirements mean that we must decide to go ahead now, if we are to go
                            ahead at all before Congress returns. It is the calendar and not a lot
                            of insistent subordinates that is forcing the hour of decision.</p>
                        <p>6. Next following messages contain three papers relating to a pause.<note n="4" xml:id="d220fn4">These papers were not sent separately but are
                                included in this telegram.</note> The first is State Department's
                            statement of a plan, with a summary of the pros and cons. Second is
                            suggested points for Presidential statement announcing a pause. The
                            third is a paper giving questions and answers that might be used by U.S.
                            spokesman in the wake of a Presidential announcement.</p>
                        <p>7. We have discussed these papers at length today with <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clark Clifford</persName>, and he sides with
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> and the Joint Chiefs against a
                            pause. The rest of us are for it. I will be prepared to summarize
                            arguments pro and con tomorrow. Two basic arguments against a pause are,
                            first, that it suggests that bombing is wrong, and second, that it
                            exposes us to diplomatic entrapment which would make resumption very
                            difficult.</p>
                        <p>8. My own conviction is still that the best preparation for the tough
                            programs of January is a peace offensive in December, and that the pause
                            is the necessary centerpiece of that effort.</p>

                        <p>In view of the major additional effort required to continue the South
                            Vietnam conflict along present lines during 1966, we can and should take
                            a major new initiative at an early date both (A) to make another bona
                            fide effort to find a peaceful solution; and (B) to convince the
                            American public and all the key nations that we have in fact exhausted
                            all possibilities before stepping up our effort.</p>
                        <p>The public and private exchange of negotiating positions between Hanoi
                            and ourselves has been most active in the last nine months. We <pb n="609" xml:id="pg_609" facs="0641"/>have gone as far as we can in
                            verbal messages, and only some major new element in the form of a
                            “pause” offers real hope toward either (A) or (B).</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Need for a Pause:</p>
                        <p>1. A pause may be essential to achieve either successful negotiations or
                            a tapering-off of military action in South Vietnam. There is a
                            significant difference between our activities in the south and our
                            bombing of the north. For reasons of face, the Hanoi regime may find it
                            difficult to begin negotiations while its own territory is being bombed.
                            For reasons of prestige in the Communist world, Peiping—and perhaps even
                            Moscow—may feel compelled to prevent any negotiations while a fellow
                            socialist state is under air attack by the United States.</p>
                        <p>2. This thesis has been reinforced by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, who has made it clear to
                            McGeorge Bundy that the Soviets would really make an effort if we
                            undertook a pause of “12-20 days”<note n="5" xml:id="d220fn5">See <ref target="#d220fn5">footnote 5</ref>, <ref target="#d208">Document
                                    208</ref>.</note>—although he made it equally clear that the
                            Soviets could give no assurance of Hanoi's response.</p>
                        <p>3. In addition to improving (although by no means guaranteeing) the
                            chances for a possible successful negotiation, a pause could improve our
                            peace-seeking posture throughout the world, which has been significantly
                            weakened by the Sevareid story in Look.<note n="6" xml:id="d220fn6">See
                                    <ref target="#d220fn2">footnote 2</ref>, <ref target="#d203">Document 203</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. A pause could also make it easier for the American people to accept
                            the substantial increase in our 1966 effort, since it would further
                            demonstrate that, before committing more American lives and resources to
                            Vietnam, we are doing everything possible to find a peaceful
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>5. A pause should reduce the likelihood of further Soviet involvement and
                            stimulate further dissension between Moscow and Peiping.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Dangers and Disadvantages of a Pause:</p>
                        <p>1. The peace demonstrations in this country and the first heavy U.S.
                            casualties have increased the danger that Hanoi might interpret a pause
                            as a signal of weakness. Continued large U.S. deployments during the
                            pause period would partially offset the chances of such an
                            interpretation.</p>
                        <p>2. There is no assurance that a pause would lead to significant
                            negotiations; the chances are much less than fifty percent.</p>
                        <p>3. What Hanoi is seeking is not a pause, but a complete cessation of
                            bombing. They could be expected to do everything possible to prevent our
                            resumption of bombing—and in this effort they would probably be joined
                            not only by the Soviet Union and Peiping, but by many of our friends
                            around the world.</p>

                        <p>4. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> foresees
                            great dangers in a pause and it would certainly be hard to persuade the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> that a pause is necessary. We
                            must, therefore, assume that a pause would create considerable concern
                            in Saigon.</p>

                        <p>After balancing these considerations, we recommend that you approve a
                            pause as soon as possible this month. This decision would, of course, be
                            subject to consultation and joint action with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Action Issues:</p>
                        <p>The two main issues that need to be faced in carrying out a pause
                            are:</p>
                        <p>1. The conditions under which we would resume bombing or continue the
                            pause.</p>
                        <p>2. A timing scenario for a pause now.</p>
                        <p>1. Conditions of resumption or continuation. We have all along taken the
                            position that we could suspend or cease bombing only in return for
                            reciprocal actions by Hanoi. We all believe that this must be the way in
                            which we present the pause both publicly and through diplomatic
                            channels.</p>
                        <p>Nonetheless, the question arises whether we would in fact be prepared to
                            continue the suspension of bombing if Hanoi were to drop its present
                            conditions for negotiation, specifically its insistence on the
                            acceptance of the “<gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> program.” Such a
                            switch in Hanoi's position would make it difficult for us to resume
                            bombing at an early date. But it would also represent a really major
                            concession by Hanoi that would tend to create sharp frictions and loss
                            of morale as between Hanoi and the Liberation Front. The latter would
                            see the concession as the possible start of a sell-out of their
                            position. This is a possibility to which both Hanoi and the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> are most sensitive because of the
                            general belief of Vietnamese Communists that Hanoi itself was sold out
                            in similar fashion by the Soviets in 1954.</p>
                        <p>We now believe we should be prepared to continue the suspension if Hanoi
                            makes this concession, provided, however, that we would reserve the
                            right to resume bombing if Hanoi in fact kept up the infiltration and
                            high levels of military activity in the south, particularly by regulars.
                            So we are talking of a suspension that might be continued while we fully
                            explore the new possibilities of negotiation, but we would maintain our
                            freedom to resume bombing even while negotiating efforts were still
                            underway.</p>
                        <p>There is a third Hanoi response that might cause us difficulty: agreeing
                            to negotiate only if the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> were
                            accepted as a principal party. We believe that your July 28 statement,
                            offering the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> the chance to present
                            its views but not as a principal party, has gone as far as we can go. We
                                <pb n="611" xml:id="pg_611" facs="0643"/>would have to accept the
                            difficulties and criticism of refusing to go further.</p>
                        <p>2. Timing scenario. We estimate that it would take 12-15 days to complete
                            the preparatory actions after decision, before a pause could be begun.
                            The key elements are:</p>
                        <p>A. Consultation with <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>. We
                            would need to bring him carefully aboard, probably in Saigon, and this
                            would take 3-4 days, with an emissary far preferable to attempting to
                            handle it by cable. We have to go over with him carefully just how he
                            would handle it with <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>, and we
                            have to bring him into all our reasoning.</p>
                        <p>B. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>'s consultation with
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. This will certainly encounter
                            some initial skepticism or resistance, and we may have to make quite
                            firm commitments on our future ground force deployments. Moreover, the
                            group nature of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> means that at
                            least four and possibly more senior leaders have to be brought in. We
                            cannot estimate less than four days for this process.</p>
                        <p>C. Notification of the Soviets and key allies, and consultation with
                            Congress. We believe this must take place not less than 2 days before
                            the announcement.</p>
                        <p>The scenario would also provide for a message to Hanoi just before the
                            announcements, and for a short public announcement by the South
                            Vietnamese and U.S. Governments jointly on the day the pause starts,
                            probably supplemented by a fuller statement by you.</p>

                            SUSPENSION OF BOMBING OF NORTHVIETNAM</p>
                        <p>1. Aggression in Vietnam continues to be gravest current threat to peace
                            of world.</p>
                        <p>2. Brief review of basic U.S. position as stated July 28—</p>
                        <p>A. Firmness against aggression;</p>
                        <p>B. Readiness to do all that is necessary to turn it back;</p>
                        <p>C. Strengthened economic and social action in South Vietnam;</p>
                        <p>D. Energetic efforts to move toward peace.</p>
                        <p>3. Events since July have shown—</p>
                        <p>A. Gallantry and effectiveness of U.S. combat forces;</p>
                        <p>B. Persistent and increasing aggression from the north;</p>
                        <p>C. Need for still further strengthening of nonmilitary effort; and</p>
                        <p>D. Continued complete rejection of peace efforts by Hanoi and Peking.</p>
                        <pb n="612" xml:id="pg_612" facs="0644"/>
                        <p>4. The continuing and increasing Communist infiltration and aggression
                            now produce the prospect of further sharp increases in the level of
                            fighting, with mounting losses and suffering for all concerned.</p>
                        <p>5. The U.S. remains strong and determined and can meet any challenge at
                            any necessary level.</p>
                        <p>6. But the U.S. wants peace and will leave no path unexplored.</p>
                        <p>7. The President has therefore decided to suspend air attack on North
                            Vietnam in order to see whether parallel actions by others can open the
                            way to peace.</p>
                        <p>8. Meanwhile, our joint effort in South Vietnam will continue. Our
                            peaceful photographic surveillance of North Vietnam will continue, the
                            effort for political progress in the south will continue, and our search
                            for unconditional discussions will continue.</p>
                        <p>9. This action is based on strength, not weakness. Bombing was and is
                            amply justified, but the object of the bombing is peace, and if a
                            suspension can move us in that direction, no one will be more pleased
                            than the United States.</p>
                        <p>10. The responsibility for aggression rests with others. The
                            responsibility for action in response to the new decision also rests
                            with them. It is for them to decide whether to move now toward peace or
                            whether their continued aggression will force upon all concerned the
                            additional costs of still more violent war in 1966.</p>
                        <p>11. Designation of Ambassador Harriman as U.S. plenipotentiary for peace
                            talks at any time, at any place.</p>
                        <p>12. Designation of Vice President Humphrey to undertake a diplomatic
                            mission to friendly countries explaining both this initiative for peace
                            and the determination of the United States to move forward firmly if
                            there is no adequate response.</p>

                            WAKE OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ANNOUNCEMENT OF A SUSPENSION OF BOMBING</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. The Military Consequence of the
                            Suspension.</p>
                        <p>Q. Does this suspension increase the danger to U.S. fighting men in South
                            Vietnam?</p>
                        <p>A. No. There is only a slow and indirect relation between bombing
                            activity in the north and the level of battle in the south, and it will
                            be quite practicable to make up the time lost in the pause by
                            intensified air attack afterwards if necessary. Moreover, the whole
                            purpose of the suspension is to induce matching action by the other side
                            to back off from its infiltration <pb n="613" xml:id="pg_613" facs="0645"/>and aggression, and any such back-off would itself
                            greatly decrease the dangers facing U.S. forces in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Q. Will not the pause allow dangerous time for reconstruction in the
                            north?</p>
                        <p>A. No. Any repairs which are effected during a pause can be dealt with
                            afterwards. Our reconnaissance will continue, and our forces will be
                            ready to renew their attacks promptly if necessary.</p>
                        <p>Q. But you have claimed the bombing is effective. Surely it must follow
                            that the suspension gives an advantage to the enemy.</p>
                        <p>A. Obviously, the suspension does give a respite while it lasts. But we
                            have never believed or asserted that the bombing of the north is the
                            central part of our activity. To put it another way, we have been
                            bombing the north for 40 weeks. Each week of suspension loses for us
                            only a small proportion of the overall effect of our bombing so far.
                            This is an acceptable loss in order to demonstrate our good faith in
                            seeking peace and in order to open the door to peace if possible.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Political Terms and Conditions of the
                            Suspension.</p>
                        <p>Q. Under what conditions do you plan to resume the bombing?</p>
                        <p>A. The President has said that this decision will be determined by the
                            actions of others, and we do not wish to lay down precise conditions or
                            to make any sort of ultimatum. We are trying to make it easy for others
                            to respond—not hard.</p>
                        <p>Q. Are you in communication with Hanoi and Moscow and Peking about this
                            matter?</p>
                        <p>A. We are making appropriate diplomatic communications on a very wide
                            scale but we think it more productive to do this privately, and we do
                            not expect to discuss these private communications. All of them are
                            governed by the policy declaration of the President.</p>
                        <p>Q. You used to say that you would only suspend the bombing if there were
                            evidence that others would respond by action on their side. Do you have
                            persuasive evidence or have you changed your position?</p>
                        <p>A. We have no clear evidence, but the situation has changed in one
                            important respect. The increasing infiltration from the north, and
                            increasing Communist violence in the south have made it clear that
                            unless there is a change in the situation, there will be much
                            intensified warfare in 1966. In this situation the President thinks it
                            right to explore every opportunity for peace, and it is in that spirit
                            that he has suspended the bombing.</p>
                        <p>Q. Would you keep up suspension in return for unconditional
                            discussions?</p>
                        <p>A. We could certainly welcome unconditional discussion, and that would be
                            a very encouraging development. But we could hardly sustain <pb n="614" xml:id="pg_614" facs="0646"/>this pause for a protracted time if
                            aggression and infiltration from the north are continued as at
                            present.</p>
                        <p>Q. Is the designation of Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> indication that you expect another Geneva
                            Conference?</p>
                        <p>A. The designation of Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> is designed to underline the sincerity and
                            determination of the United States in seeking to move to the peace
                            table. The form and membership of such a conference are not important to
                            the United States, which will meet with any interested government at any
                            time.</p>
                        <p>Q. The Communists will undoubtedly now press you on the question of
                            negotiations with the Viet Cong. Are you ready to soften your position
                            on this as you have apparently softened your position on a pause in the
                            bombing?</p>
                        <p>A. We continue to stand on the President's statement of July 28. “If
                            Hanoi is ready to negotiate, the Viet Cong would have no difficulty in
                            being represented and having their views presented. We would not think
                            that would be an insurmountable problem at all.”</p>

                            such event which has happened during my service in Viet-Nam. Like its
                            predecessors, it stimulates the thought, first, that we are not
                            interlopers or trespassers here but that we are here legally and have a
                            right to be here. <pb n="615" xml:id="pg_615" facs="0647"/>This prompts
                            the further thought that we have a duty to protect our own personnel
                            against future terrorist attacks of this kind. For us to strike back,
                            therefore, is not only a just punishment for an outrageous aggression
                            but it may also head off another similar outrage. This is a worthy
                            aim.</p>
                        <p>2. I therefore recommend that we inflict some punishment on North
                            Viet-Nam which we will state is a retaliation. It could be something
                            which we intend to do anyway.</p>
                        <p>3. You in Washington are much better informed than I am but some
                            possibilities which seem to me to be worthy are bombing coal mines,

                            substantial change in the past few months in the economic, political or
                            pacification situation. There is a serious threat of inflation because
                            of the mixture of US force <pb n="616" xml:id="pg_616" facs="0648"/>build-up and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> deficit on the one
                            hand and the tightly stretched Vietnamese economy on the other; the
                                <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> “government of generals” is
                            surviving, but not acquiring wide support or generating actions;
                            pacification is thoroughly stalled, with no guarantee that security
                            anywhere is permanent and no indications that able and willing
                            leadership will emerge in the absence of that permanent security. (Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> estimates his
                            government “controls” only 25% of the population today and reports that
                            his pacification chief hopes to increase that to 50% two years from
                            now.)</p>
                        <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Military situation.</hi> The dramatic recent changes
                            in the situation are on the military side. They are the increased
                            infiltration from the North (mainly on greatly improved routes through
                            Laos) and the increased willingness of the Communist forces to stand and
                            fight, even in large-scale engagements. The Ia Drang River Campaign of
                            November is an example. The Communists appear to have decided to
                            increase their forces in South Vietnam both by heavy recruitment in the
                            South (especially in the Delta) and by infiltration of regular North
                            Vietnamese forces from the North. We believe that nine regular North
                            Vietnamese regiments (27 infantry battalions) have been infiltrated in
                            the past year, joining the estimated 83 <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> battalions in the South. The rate of infiltration has
                            increased from three battalion equivalents a month in late 1964 to a
                            high of 9 or 12 during one month this past fall. General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> estimates that through
                            1966 North Vietnam will have the capability<note n="2" xml:id="d222fn2">They may or may not intend to use their capability—indications are
                                that they will. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> to expand its
                            armed forces in order to infiltrate three regiments (9 battalion
                            equivalents, or 4500 men) a month, and that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in South Vietnam can recruit and train 7 new battalion
                            equivalents a month—together adding 16 battalion equivalents a month to
                            the enemy forces. Communist casualties and desertions can be expected to
                            go up if our recommendations for increased US, South Vietnamese and
                            third-country forces are accepted. Nevertheless, the enemy can be
                            expected to enlarge his present strength of 110 battalion equivalents to
                            more than 150 battalion equivalents by the end of calendar 1966, when
                            hopefully his losses can be made to equal his input.</p>
                        <p>As for the Communist ability to supply this force, it is estimated that,
                            even taking account of interdiction of routes by air and sea, more than
                            200 tons of supplies a day on the average can be infiltrated—more than
                            enough, allowing for the extent to which the enemy lives off the land,
                            to support the likely <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> force at the likely level of
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>To meet this possible—and in our view likely—Communist buildup, the
                            presently contemplated Phase I forces will not be enough. <pb n="617" xml:id="pg_617" facs="0649"/>Phase I forces, almost all in place by
                            the end of this year, involve 130 South Vietnamese, 9 Korean, 1
                            Australian and 34 US combat battalions (approximately 220,000
                            Americans). Bearing in mind the nature of the war, the expected weighted
                            combat force ratio of less than 2-to-1 will not be good enough. Nor will
                            the originally contemplated Phase II addition of 28 more US battalions
                            (112,000 men) be enough; the combat force ratio, even with 32 new South
                            Vietnamese battalions, would still be little better than 2-to-1 at the
                            end of 1966. The initiative which we have held since August would pass
                            to the enemy; we would fall far short of what we expected to achieve in
                            terms of population control and disruption of enemy bases and lines of
                            communications. Indeed, it is estimated that, with the contemplated
                            Phase II addition of 28 US battalions, we would be able only to hold our
                            present geographical positions.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Recommendations for Military Deployments</p>
                        <p>We believe that, whether or not major new diplomatic initiatives are
                            made, the United States must send a substantial number of additional
                            forces to Vietnam if we are to avoid being defeated there. Specifically,
                            to maintain the initiative against the growing Communist forces, we
                            recommend:</p>
                        <p>1. That the Republic of Korea be requested, at the appropriate time early
                            in 1966, to increase their present deployment of 9 combat battalions to
                            18 combat battalions (the addition of one division) before July 1966 and
                            to 21 combat battalions (the addition of another brigade) before October
                            1966.</p>
                        <p>2. That the Government of Australia be requested to increase their
                            present deployment of 1 combat battalion to 2 combat battalions before
                            October 1966 and that efforts be made to obtain combat forces from other
                            friendly countries—e.g., the Philippines, Thailand and Greece.</p>
                        <p>3. That the US be prepared to increase its deployment of ground troops by
                            the end of 1966 from 34 combat battalions to 74 combat battalions and
                            approve now the initial increments of this deployment. If the 74 US
                            battalions—together with increases in air squadrons, naval units, air
                            defense, combat support, construction units and miscellaneous logistic
                            support and advisory personnel which we also recommend—were to be
                            deployed, it would bring the total US personnel in Vietnam to
                            approximately 400,000. The end 1965 strength of 200,000 would increase
                            during 1966 at the rate of approximately 15,000 a month. It should be
                            understood that further deployments (perhaps exceeding an additional
                            200,000 men) may be needed in 1967. Although the 1966 deployments to
                            South Vietnam may require some shift of forces from other theaters, it
                            is believed that they can be accomplished without calling up reserve
                            personnel; however, the Joint Chiefs of Staff do not believe additional
                            forces <pb n="618" xml:id="pg_618" facs="0650"/>can be deployed to
                            Southeast Asia or elsewhere unless reserves are called.</p>
                        <p>The above program is concurred in by General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAUSG1">Sharp</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>

                        <p>Decisions already taken together with those recommended above will
                            require increased obligational authority both in FY 1966 and FY
                            1967.</p>
                        <p>1. In the January 1966 Supplemental for FY 1966, the Department of
                            Defense, to cover increased Vietnam costs, will require approximately
                            $11 billion<note n="3" xml:id="d222fn3">The January Supplemental for
                                    <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> will total about $12.5

                                increases authorized by Congress after the original '66 budget was
                                submitted by the President. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> of
                            new obligational authority to be added to the $1.7 billion authorized in
                            the August Supplemental. The expenditure effect in FY 1966 of these two
                            add-ons will be $4-1/2 billion.</p>
                        <p>2. In FY 1967 the Department of Defense will require $9.8 billion in new
                            obligational authority and $11.8 billion in expenditures to finance the
                            war in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>3. The increases in non-military costs attributable to Vietnam in both
                            the FY 1966 January Supplemental and in the FY 1967 budget can be
                            expected to be somewhat less than $1 billion—whatever is required must
                            be provided.</p>
                        <p>(The estimates of military costs given above are based on the premise
                            that the war will end by June 30, 1967. As time passes and as actions

                            obligational authority will have to be sought. Thus, it may be necessary
                            to go back to the Congress in June or July 1966 for an amendment to the
                            FY 1967 authorizations and appropriations to take account of those added

                            Deployments</p>
                        <p>Deployments of the kind we have recommended will not guarantee success.
                            Our intelligence estimate is that the present Communist policy is to
                            continue to prosecute the war vigorously in the South. They continue to
                            believe that the war will be a long one, that time is their ally, and
                            that their own staying power is superior to ours. They recognize that
                            the US reinforcements of 1965 signify a determination to avoid defeat,
                            and that more US troops can be expected. Even though the Communists will
                            continue to suffer heavily from <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and
                            US ground and air action, we expect them, upon learning of any US
                            intentions to augment its forces, to boost their own commitment and to
                            test US capabilities and will to persevere <pb n="619" xml:id="pg_619" facs="0651"/>at a higher level of conflict and casualties (US
                            killed-in-action with the recommended deployments can be expected to
                            reach 1000 a month).</p>
                        <p>If the US were willing to commit enough forces—perhaps 600,000 men or
                            more—we could ultimately prevent the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> from sustaining the
                            conflict at a significant level. When this point was reached, however,
                            the question of Chinese intervention would become critical.<note n="4" xml:id="d222fn4">We are generally agreed that the Chinese Communists
                                will intervene with combat forces to prevent destruction of the
                                Communist regime in the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. It is
                                less clear whether they would intervene to prevent a <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                                defeat in the South. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> The
                            intelligence estimate is that the chances are a little better than even
                            that, at this stage, Hanoi and Peiping would choose to reduce the effort
                            in the South and try to salvage their resources for another day; but
                            there is an almost equal chance that they would enlarge the war and
                            bring in large numbers of Chinese forces (they have made certain
                            preparations which could point in this direction).</p>
                        <p>It follows, therefore, that the odds are about even that, even with the
                            recommended deployments, we will be faced in early 1967 with a military
                            standoff at a much higher level, with pacification still stalled, and
                            with any prospect of military success marred by the chances of an active
                            Chinese intervention.</p>

                            I don't see any light down that barrel. We're getting deeper and deeper

                            would be willing to meet his “former Minister”.</p>
                        <p>2. I brought up the matter of the so-called “Ambassador's” credentials
                            and how to judge their value. He did not answer this, but he did say
                            that he vouched absolutely for the seriousness and respectability of the
                            “former Minister”.</p>
                        <p>3. Comment: I do not know how to judge the so-called letter of
                            credentials and am disposed to go ahead on the basis that Palmas vouches
                            for the “former Minister” and that the “former Minister” in turn vouches
                            for the “Ambassador”.</p>
                        <p>4. I said that I was absolutely opposed to any kind of a trick whereby we
                            would be lulled to sleep while the Viet Cong went ahead and gained
                            ground. Also would I be opposed to using talks as a device to get me in
                            wrong with the Government of Viet-Nam. Palmas absolutely vouched for the
                            fact that there would be no trickery of this kind.</p>
                        <pb n="623" xml:id="pg_623" facs="0655"/>
                        <p>5. He then read me what purported to be the entire text of his telegram
                            to the Vatican. Some of the points which became very clear from what he
                            was reading and which I did not cover adequately in my previous telegram
                            were as follows:</p>
                        <p>6. The entrance into South Viet-Nam of the troops of the Hanoi regime
                            changes the nature of the war completely. Palmas recalled the change in
                            the psychology in Italy during World War II when the Germans came into
                            Italy. The Viet Cong is frightened of North Viet-Nam taking over the
                            entire country and defeating the Americans. They no longer wish help
                            from Hanoi. They had used Hanoi when they were trying to conquer South
                            Viet-Nam but had never wanted to be taken over by them. One reason they
                            want the American troops to stay is to guarantee the independence of
                            South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>7. It was also made clear in the telegram to the Vatican that the Viet
                            Cong recognized that at the proper time I would have to tell the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. I suggested that I do this after the
                            first meeting and he agreed. He also agreed with my judgment that it
                            would be better to tell <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Tran Van
                                Do</persName> in the first instance rather than <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>. It was <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Tran Van Do</persName> who had said to Palmas that he could not
                            conceive of the nationalist element of the Viet Cong defecting but that
                            it would, of course, be wonderful if it happened.</p>
                        <p>8. Palmas believes that the so-called Liberation Front is distinct from
                            the Viet Cong High Command. He believes that a majority of the Front are
                            nationalist, but that the military command is controlled by
                            Communists.</p>
                        <p>9. His “former Minister” had said last Wednesday that he would be in
                            touch with Palmas within ten days. One week went by today.</p>
                        <p>10. Palmas suggested that when the “former Minister” was with him that he
                            could call me up and I could come over and have my talk at the Apostolic
                            Delegate's house.</p>
                        <p>11. Comment: Upon reflection, I think that would be a good thing to do.
                            In fact, I would not object to having all the discussions in the house
                            of the Papal Delegate. They would know everything, which might be just
                            as well.</p>
                        <p>12. Your view of para. 11 would be appreciated.</p>
                        <p>13. If I may turn to another matter, I hope you will read Embtels 1931
                            and 1997.<note n="2" xml:id="d224fn2">In telegram 1931, November 29, and

                        <p>I attach a copy of a conversation that Dean Rusk had with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> after our meeting at
                            the Ranch. The Secretary tells me that he and <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> both interpret this
                            conversation as confirming their view that the Soviets would make an
                            effort to move things onward during the pause. In this sense they
                            incline to think that it substantiates their belief that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s talk with me was
                                important.<note n="2" xml:id="d225fn2">See <ref target="#d225fn5">footnote 5</ref>, <ref target="#d208">Document

                        <p>The Secretary said with respect to the hostilities in Viet-Nam, that it
                            was not clear how we turn at this point. We had been in touch with Hanoi
                                <pb n="625" xml:id="pg_625" facs="0657"/>and with various capitals
                            around the world. We had also had conversations with the Hungarian
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> here in
                                Washington.<note n="5" xml:id="d225fn5">See <ref target="#d160">Document 160</ref>.</note> The Ambassador inquired if we had
                            been in touch with Hanoi after the General Assembly discussion.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that we had.<note n="6" xml:id="d225fn6">See <ref target="#d205">Document 205</ref>.</note> There had been no
                            indication of the slightest interest in bringing this affair to a
                            peaceful conclusion. He did not fully understand why the two co-Chairmen
                            could not take some initiative. He said that both we and Hanoi had
                            referred to the 1954 Agreements. Hanoi puts four points as its
                            interpretation of these Agreements but the Secretary wished to point out
                            that the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> is not mentioned in these
                            Accords.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador asked if we had talked with them with regard to the other
                            points. It appeared to him that we were asking unconditional surrender.
                            He said he was not speaking of Hanoi but of the Liberation Front. He
                            said that even yesterday the Secretary indicated he did not want to
                            speak with the people when we were fighting; namely, the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>. At least they were doing the major
                            fighting.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that our combat troops had not been in Viet-Nam
                            until Hanoi had moved in.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said our own figures showed the great number of
                            South-Vietnamese that had been fighting us. He said no one from their
                            side could accept that it was only Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that among the fourteen million people in South
                            Viet-Nam there was an overwhelming consensus that they did not want
                            Hanoi. We were prepared to support the elections in South Viet-Nam but
                            the Liberation Front said, “no.”</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador asked under what formula we would propose elections. The
                            Secretary replied on the condition that there was peace in the country
                            which would permit elections.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_Diem1">Diem</persName> had refused to talk of elections. He then inquired
                            about the possibility of stopping the bombardment of North Viet-Nam.
                            Were we prepared to consider this? Parenthetically, he noted that a
                            twelve hour suspension of fighting had been offered<note n="7" xml:id="d225fn7">A communique of the Central Committee of the NLFSV,
                                broadcast by Liberation Radio on December 7 in Vietnamese to South

                                Liberation Armed Forces will stop attacks throughout South Viet-Nam

                                soldiers of various forces could attend Mass and celebrate Christmas
                                Eve. The same broadcast carried a similar communique from the South
                                Viet-Nam Liberation Armed Forces Command which contained regulations
                                governing the cease-fire, including the condition that troops carry
                                no weapons or means of spying. (Text in <gloss target="#t_FBIS1">FBIS</gloss>, South Vietnam, December 8, 1965)</note> and that

                        <pb n="626" xml:id="pg_626" facs="0658"/>
                        <p>The Secretary asked that if the Ambassador were in Viet-Nam, would he put
                            his arms down for twelve hours. The other side had said they would not
                            shoot people who went to church unarmed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that this was an
                            aside and he returned to the subject of bombing, which was the main
                            thing.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he had been careful not to close the door on this in
                            his public statements but he could not understand why it was impossible
                            to find out privately what would happen if we did stop the bombing. He
                            had asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> and we had
                            asked Hanoi. <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Min</persName> had sent
                            Linus Pauling a message which Pauling interpreted to mean that the four
                            points were not a precondition of negotiations. If this were a fact, why
                            did they not say so?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said they could not talk
                            of negotiations while the bombing went on. He said, frankly, he did not
                            understand the American stubbornness. The United States was a big power.
                            No one would think we were weak if we stopped the bombing to create a
                            better atmosphere. His feeling was that we were too sensitive to
                            domestic criticism.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said this was not the problem. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he did not understand our position and he
                            made clear that in these and other remarks he was speaking personally.
                            He said the suspension for four days had not been enough and may even
                            have done harm. This did not give anyone any chance to do anything about
                            it. He asked what harm it would do to have some criticism in the United
                            States. He was sure it would be understood abroad.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he agreed this was an informal conversation. He
                            continued that we don't even know the direction of the attitude the
                            Soviet Union would take if we stopped bombing. Would they try to arrange
                            a settlement on the basis of the 1954 Accords? <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that stopping the bombing
                            would create a better atmosphere. He could not give any undertaking as
                            to what would happen but the Soviet Union would not try to influence
                            North Viet-Nam while they were being bombed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that only the United States is not supposed to
                            have face. During the Berlin blockade we had talked to the Soviet Union
                            privately. (The Ambassador interjected that there had been no fighting
                            going on.) The Secretary continued that during the Korean war we had
                            private talks that had led to peace.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he did not see any
                            loss for the United States in stopping the bombing. No one would
                            seriously say that the United States was a weak power. He asked whether
                            the Secretary thought the Soviet Government would think that we had lost
                            face.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said it was not a question of Moscow, but of Hanoi.
                            Apparently they thought the United States was about to collapse, judging
                            from the publicity they gave the demonstrations in this country <pb n="627" xml:id="pg_627" facs="0659"/>against United States policy.
                            Perhaps stopping the bombing would make them think this was so. Neither
                            he nor the Ambassador knew what Hanoi's reaction would be.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he did not invite us to resume bombing after a
                            suspension, but implied that this was our option. He asked whether the
                            Secretary thought that more and more bombing would convince the other
                            side.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he was prepared to bet a new hat that when Johnson
                            defeated Goldwater, Hanoi had said to themselves that they could have a
                            larger war without reaction from the United States.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said the question was
                            how to finish the affair. Why not begin with the suspension of bombing?
                            The only argument he had heard was that this would be a sign of
                            weakness.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that Hanoi had never even hinted that they would do
                            anything if the bombing stopped. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> pointed out that both the Hungarians and the
                            Soviets had suggested that this could be a step on a way out. Neither of
                            them, however, had the authority to speak for others.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said it was hard for us to understand the failure to carry
                            out the agreement on Laos. Hanoi had never complied with it and there
                            was nothing we wanted more than one thousand percent compliance with it
                            in every respect. The other side had referred to the military clauses of
                            the 1954 Agreement. Why not get back to this and the 1962 Agreement? We
                            have said that we wanted no bases or forces in that area. The South
                            Viet-Namese could determine their own fate provided North Viet-Nam did
                            not intervene by force. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            said that in view of what the Secretary said regarding bombing in North
                            Viet-Nam, and he was aware that we were already bombing in Laos, he did
                            not see any way out or how the conflict could fail to be enlarged.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we did not want even the present level of hostilities.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he had
                            heard talk of bombing Haiphong and Laos and Cambodia. The Secretary said
                            the problem was how could we find restraint on the other side? <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> repeated that the United
                            States was a big power but did not want to make any gestures. We were
                            increasing our troops. Were we trying to impress the Soviets? The
                            Secretary said no, we were trying to impress Hanoi. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked what would come
                            afterwards. Would we intervene in North Viet-Nam? If this occurred, then
                            what would happen?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            had used the phrase “unconditional surrender.” Speaking frankly, this
                            was an abuse of language. We were not asking the other side to surrender
                            or do anything but to stop their intervention. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said we were trying to force
                            the Liberation Front to admit they were only tools or stooges of Hanoi.
                            He pointed out that they had representatives in Peking and Moscow and
                            elsewhere. The <pb n="628" xml:id="pg_628" facs="0660"/>other side was
                            asked to accept unconditional discussions, ignoring the Liberation
                            Front, and to accept the United States position that it was only Hanoi
                            that was involved. This made the situation very difficult for Hanoi, as
                            well as for the Soviet Union. He was not sure that some of the people in
                            South Viet-Nam would continue their activities no matter what
                            happened.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that we were not shooting them until Hanoi came
                            in. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> repeated that from
                            the beginning we demanded Hanoi accept our condition that we were not
                            fighting local people but Hanoi. He said there could be no armed
                            intervention unless there were local people fighting and we did not wish
                            to recognize the people that were fighting us.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that we wished to recognize them all, including the
                            Buddhists, the Catholics, the Montagnards.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> contended that the
                            Secretary was saying to the other side, “Accept our formula and then we
                            will have unconditional talks.” He asked if we were at war with
                            Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we had told Hanoi that they could talk about their
                            four points but we wanted to talk about our points. He did not see any
                            other way than to sit down at the table to do this.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> again said his personal
                            feeling was that the best thing was to stop the bombing. He could not
                            say what would happen but he was sure the atmosphere would be
                            better.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary inquired whether if we did stop bombing and there were no
                            response, would the crisis then be greater?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> responded that if we
                            stopped it only for a short time and put it in the form of an ultimatum,
                            this might be. The Secretary asked what if we stopped and there were an
                            ultimatum from Peking or from Moscow as to what would happen if we
                            resumed? We did not even know if this would happen or not.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said there was nothing
                            to discuss now while we continued to wage a big war.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said it was extraordinary that there could be discussions
                            only if one side stopped shooting.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied that he presumed
                            we would continue shooting in the South, although he was not suggesting
                            we do so.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary raised the question as to whether North Viet-Nam would keep
                            infiltrating the South. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            said that the Soviets were sure that North Viet-Nam did not have control
                            of all Viet Cong units. The Secretary rejoined that we were very sure
                            and had good information that there were very few that Hanoi did not
                            control.</p>
                        <p>After a brief discussion reported separately on non-proliferation, the
                            Secretary said that both the Soviet Union and the United States had <pb n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0661"/>enormous stakes in Asia. We
                            believed that frontiers should not be changed by force. If help were
                            needed to demarcate the frontier or to settle disputes, we should both
                            help. We had a considerable community of interest in this.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that as far as he
                            knew, there was no question of frontiers. The Secretary said the Chinese
                            had asked for changes in their frontier with India. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> interjected that the Soviet
                            Union had made clear its disapproval of this.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said they also had some claims for a large chunk of Soviet
                            territory.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied that there had
                            been reports in the press to this effect but in fact they had asked for
                            only five kilometers. (It was not clear whether he was talking of square
                            kilometers or what.) <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            continued that he thought we must give more attention to our relations,
                            which were not developing well. He did not know if this deterioration
                            was deliberate or a result of a chain of events. He made reference to
                            the Penkovsky papers<note n="8" xml:id="d225fn8"> Oleg Penkovsky, <hi rend="italic">The Penkovsky Papers</hi> (Garden City, NJ:
                                Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc., 1965).</note> and a recently
                            published Dodd Committee report<note n="9" xml:id="d225fn9">Not further
                                identified.</note> which accused the leaders of the Soviet Union of
                            being murderers. He also mentioned a man who paraded near the Soviet
                            Embassy with a placard saying that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> were murderers.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that he understood there were ten thousand
                            demonstrators in front of our Embassy today. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> continued that he now understood that Soviet
                            attaches had no right to buy books in Brentano's on certain subjects
                            unless they asked the Pentagon first. He thought this was incredible.
                            The Secretary replied that we were aware of the instructions given to
                            the Communist Party in this country. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said they did not come from his Embassy.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary concluded by stating that perhaps he would be in touch with
                            the Ambassador again on how to proceed. He again referred to the
                            bitterness in this country after the breaking of the Laotian agreement.
                            He also referred to a recent interview charging us with aggression.<note n="10" xml:id="d225fn10">Reference is to an interview of <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> on December 6 by <persName corresp="#p_RJB1">James Reston</persName> of <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>; extract in <hi rend="italic">American

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said the Soviets were in
                            favor of compliance. The Secretary asked if they could not get together
                            with the British and demand compliance.</p>
                        <pb n="630" xml:id="pg_630" facs="0662"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said this was difficult
                            now as our planes were flying there. The Secretary said this should not
                            be a problem as we were ready to comply completely. He continued that
                            the Soviets had accused us of being dragged along by the Germans. We
                            thought that the Soviets were being dragged along by Hanoi. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> referred to the number of
                            times he had come to the Secretary to try to get discussions going on
                            Cambodia, but he had refused. The Secretary replied that this was
                            because Sihanouk had raised these matters in complete hostility to
                            Thailand and South Viet-Nam. We had been working with Thailand and South
                            Viet-Nam to get these matters settled before a conference.</p>
                        <p>At this point, since both the Ambassador and the Secretary had dinner
                            engagements, the conversation ended.</p>

                        <p>1. I attach Bob McNamara's account of his telephone conversation with
                            members of Congress on South Vietnam. It is highly instructive. Before
                            he left for Chicago and the Coast, Dean Rusk had seen Sparkman, Church,
                            and Javits.<note n="2" xml:id="d226fn2"> Rusk met with <persName corresp="#p_SJJ2">Sparkman</persName> from 12:05 to 12:33 p.m.
                                on December 8, with Church from 3:30 to 4:06 p.m. also on December
                                8, and with <persName corresp="#p_JJK1">Javits</persName> from 8:45
                                to 9:20 a.m. on December 9. (Ibid., Rusk Appointment Book)</note> He
                            gave me the following account of their views:</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SJJ2">Sparkman</persName> thinks we need a
                            resolution and that it should be quite a tough one. He would favor a
                            pause if there is even a 5% chance that it would be successful in
                            opening the road to negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Senator Church does not think a resolution would be a good idea unless we
                            are proposing some major change, like bombing Hanoi, or putting ground
                            forces in Laos. He is strongly in favor of a pause.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_JJK1">Javits</persName> is in favor of a
                            resolution and would like to be helpful in any way he can about it. He
                            would also favor a pause unless the military authorities say it would
                            have a major military impact on the effectiveness <pb n="631" xml:id="pg_631" facs="0663"/>of our effort in the south. (This last
                            sounds like an effort to have it both ways.)</p>
                        <p>2. I continue to be a strong believer in a December pause, and of course
                            the time is getting shorter every minute. Rusk and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and I plan to review this
                            matter again on Saturday morning,<note n="3" xml:id="d226fn3">December
                                11.</note> and at that point it may be wise for us to call you and
                            take a final reading. It will be very difficult to do a good job of the
                            pause if the decision is put over beyond that point.</p>
                        <p>3. My own basic reason for supporting the pause is simply that we are
                            going to have to do these other tough things in January. I think the
                            criticism the pause will get will be rubbed out by the energy of our
                            January message, and on the other hand, I think the peace-lovers will
                            support our January actions a whole lot more if there has been a pause
                            beforehand. I find that Komer strongly shares this view, and that
                            Califano seems to be shifting toward it.</p>

                        <p rend="center">MEMORANDUM OF TELEPHONE CONVERSATIONS WITH MEMBERS OF
                            CONGRESS RELATING TO SOUTH VIETNAM</p>
                        <p>I called but was unable to talk to the following men:</p>
                        <p>Senator Lister Hill—has had minor surgery and will be out of his office
                            for two or three days.</p>
                        <p>Senator Stuart Symington—out of the country</p>
                        <p>Senator Henry Jackson—in Vietnam</p>
                        <p>Representative Glenard Lipscomb—in the Far East</p>
                        <p>Representative Robert Sikes—in the Far East</p>
                        <p>Representative George Mahon—on vacation; cannot be reached until 14
                            December</p>
                        <p>Representative William Bates—in Europe</p>
                        <p>Representative Philip Philbin—in Europe</p>
                        <p>Representative Mendel Rivers—in Europe</p>
                        <pb n="632" xml:id="pg_632" facs="0664"/>
                        <p>With each of the following I summarized the current situation, the
                            prospects for continuing increases in Viet Cong strength, the
                            possibility that the conflict would increase in intensity, and the need
                            for increased U.S. deployments if we were to avoid a military defeat or
                            stalemate. I estimated that the cost of our South Vietnamese operations
                            would require a January Supplement of some $10-12 billion and a FY '67
                            budget of equal amount. I asked for their opinions on expanding U.S.
                            forces; requesting Congressional support; intensifying the bombing of
                            North Vietnam, and initiating diplomatic initiatives, (e.g., a pause in
                            the bombing, an appeal to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, visits
                            to Communist states by peace emissaries).</p>
                        <p>1. Senator John Pastore </p>
                        <p>a. He asked theoretically where we are going if we put in 400,000
                            men.</p>
                        <p>b. Most of the American public doesn't understand what we are up
                            against—the American public won't take the war for long.</p>
                        <p>c. We should make a serious effort to settle the conflict (through use of
                            pause, etc.) before we start bombing on an expanded scale or further
                            increase the number of U.S. troops in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>d. The President should come before the Congress and see the matter
                            debated before he expands U.S. forces in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>2. Senator Mike Monroney </p>
                        <p>a. He is leery of escalation beyond the current level of conflict. The
                            country doesn't want to see the war expanded beyond its present
                            boundary.</p>
                        <p>b. The country would accept the deployment of a total of 400,000 men if
                            it believes the war will not spread beyond South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>c. We should not undertake an expanded military program without holding
                            out the opportunity for peace negotiations through the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or through other third parties.</p>
                        <p>d. He seriously questions whether we should substantially expand the
                            bombing in North Vietnam—he does not believe the added bombing would be
                            worth the risk.</p>
                        <p>e. We should go to Congress for a Joint Resolution if substantial
                            additional forces are to be sent to the Far East.</p>
                        <p>3. Senator Warren Magnuson </p>
                        <p>a. The people now feel we are at war and we should do whatever is
                            required to finish the job—in particular, we should deploy whatever
                            troops are necessary.</p>
                        <p>b. He is not certain how the bombing program should be changed, if at
                            all. He is unclear as to how effective it has been to date, but he is
                            certain the people would support more if the President considers it
                            desirable.</p>
                        <pb n="633" xml:id="pg_633" facs="0665"/>
                        <p>c. Peace moves should be made to coincide with whatever additional
                            military action we take.</p>
                        <p>d. The President should request Congressional support in the form of a
                            Joint Resolution.</p>
                        <p>e. He wished to emphasize again the President should with one hand carry
                            on the war and with the other hand fight for peace.</p>
                        <p>4. Senator Leverett Saltonstall </p>
                        <p>a. Increasingly, the people are asking what do we want and how far are we
                            going.</p>
                        <p>b. The Congress will support the deployment of additional troops, but
                            such action should be complemented by a request for some form of
                            Congressional Resolution.</p>
                        <p>c. The increasing number of casualties is beginning to stir up the people
                            to ask why are we in South Vietnam; what can be done about further
                            losses; how far are we going.</p>
                        <p>d. Expanding the bombing program in the North is a terrible risk, but we
                            must consider it. He would support a Presidential decision to bomb Hanoi
                            and Haiphong because we must do enough to bring the Viet Cong to a
                            sensible peace negotiation. He believes we should mine Haiphong
                            Harbor.</p>
                        <p>e. He doesn't believe a pause in the bombing would accomplish anything.
                            We must keep the military pressure on so that Hanoi will be forced to
                            sit down at the bargaining table.</p>
                        <p>5. Senator Robert Kennedy </p>
                        <p>a. It is difficult for him to provide a worthwhile judgment after only
                            two or three minutes of thought.</p>
                        <p>b. People are becoming more and more concerned as the casualties rise.
                            They do not understand the alternatives open to us and these should be
                            explained to them. The political situation is extremely dangerous
                            because the people do not understand the war.</p>
                        <p>c. He cannot give an answer as to whether or not we should expand our
                            troop deployments after only two or three minutes of discussion.</p>
                        <p>d. We should take some form of dramatic political action. Such action
                            might be built around Christmas. Political action is absolutely required
                            if a further military buildup is likely. Among actions which might be
                            considered would be an appeal to the Pope; a cease fire; contacts with
                            the Liberation Front in Algeria; a longer suspension of the bombing.
                            Political actions are important for support both within the U.S. and
                            also abroad. He sees no sign of any major effort on the political
                            side.</p>
                        <p>e. If we do authorize an additional military buildup, some form of
                            Congressional action is desirable.</p>
                        <pb n="634" xml:id="pg_634" facs="0666"/>
                        <p>6. Speaker <persName corresp="#p_MCJW1">John McCormack</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. We are committed in Vietnam and we must do everything necessary to
                            carry out our commitment.</p>
                        <p>b. He is on the side of expanding our military strength in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>c. The situation is comparable to that faced by the Free World when
                            Hitler started his aggression. If South Vietnam goes, the rest of Asia
                            will collapse like dominoes before an aggressive China.</p>
                        <p>d. Whatever additional bombing is necessary he would initiate.</p>
                        <p>e. Without further thought, he would be hesitant to ask action of
                            Congress, but he would want more time to think about this question.</p>
                        <p>f. Whatever decisions are made by the President he will back up.</p>
                        <p>7. Representative <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Gerald Ford</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. People are asking: are we getting too deeply involved on the ground;
                            are we fully utilizing our air power; why don't we stop the flow of
                            goods into the port of Haiphong.</p>
                        <p>b. Before supporting an expansion of our ground forces, he would like to
                            see us use more air power against military targets in North Vietnam,
                            and, in particular, he believes we should mine Haiphong Harbor.</p>
                        <p>c. He believes it would be wise to ask for Congressional support of an
                            expanded program of military deployments.</p>
                        <p>8. Representative Edward Hebert.</p>
                        <p>a. We should do whatever is necessary to win. If more troops are
                            required, send them. If more bombing is necessary, including mining the
                            Haiphong Harbor, initiate it.</p>
                        <p>b. We haven't made clear to the people why we are there.</p>
                        <p>c. Diplomatic moves may help psychologically, and if so, they should be
                            undertaken, although nothing concrete is likely to follow from them.</p>
                        <p>d. If additional deployments are undertaken, it may be necessary to go
                            back to Congress to get a Resolution of support.</p>
                        <p>9. Senator Sam Ervin </p>
                        <p>a. We ought to bomb North Vietnam out of existence because they are
                            initiating the aggression. We can't afford to retreat further in the

                        <p>b. He would put more troops in South Vietnam if they are needed.</p>
                        <p>c. It might be advisable to go back to Congress for further support.</p>
                        <p>d. He believes it would be wise to give North Vietnam a warning or a
                            chance to negotiate (e.g., through a pause) before expanding the
                            bombing.</p>
                        <p>10. Representative <persName corresp="#p_ALC1">Leslie Arends</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. If we need more men in South Vietnam we should send them, although he
                            hates to think about it.</p>
                        <pb n="635" xml:id="pg_635" facs="0667"/>
                        <p>b. He believes we should expand the bombing in North Vietnam and he is
                            certain we should do this if we send in more troops.</p>
                        <p>c. He would favor a request for a Congressional Resolution of
                            support.</p>
                        <p>d. He does not favor diplomatic moves now. He doubts the values of
                            negotiation because we can't trust the other side. However, we should
                            continue to probe peace offers when they come.</p>
                        <p>e. He believes we should stay in Vietnam. We are doing what needs to be
                            done. He will continue to support us.</p>
                        <p>11. Senator <persName corresp="#p_KTH1">Thomas Kuchel</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. He believes we should and must expand our forces in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>b. The people in California want us to get on with the war and would
                            favor expanding the bombing.</p>
                        <p>c. The people would like to see the problem moved to the conference
                            table, but they believe the initial move must come from Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>d. He does not feel qualified to advise on whether we should initiate a
                            pause or move to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>e. He does not believe additional Congressional action is required.</p>

                        <p>For <persName corresp="#p_MFEJ1">Meloy</persName> from Secretary.</p>
                        <p>Would you inform Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>
                            we have been having some discussion here about the various public
                            proposals for a limited possibility of an early pause in the bombing of
                            North Viet-Nam. Although we have no significant indication that there
                            would be any constructive Hanoi response, it can be argued that such a
                            pause would at least open the way to Soviet activity and at the very
                            least might persuade people that we were exhausting every reasonable
                            avenue to peace. On the negative side, we have been somewhat concerned
                            at the possibility of misinterpretation in Saigon or even in Hanoi, and
                            Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> may have had
                            relevant discussions or observations in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>I would be most grateful if you could discuss this privately and quietly
                            with him, so that his reactions could be conveyed to me at once.</p>
                        <p>For the Secretary from <persName corresp="#p_MFEJ1">Meloy</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Your message was received and discussed with Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> just prior departure Hong Kong
                            for Manila. Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> has
                            given careful thought to the question and has consulted Senator Aiken
                            privately. Following is substance Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>'s views:</p>
                        <p>1. American officials in Saigon made little reference to subject of
                            bombing North Vietnam or its expansion or suspension, taking the
                            position they have no responsibility for it. Neither was matter
                            discussed in detail by Vietnamese authorities during Saigon visit.
                            However, it could be expected that <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> and his colleagues might well look with disfavor and
                            concern on any action which would appear to be letting up of our
                            military pressure on the enemy. On other hand bombing of north is now
                            less of a psychological factor in south in view of the reassuring
                            presence of large U.S. forces.</p>
                        <p>2. Influx of men and material from North Vietnam will probably continue
                            whether bombing is suspended, maintained or extended. Senator certainly
                            received the impression that present bombing of the North was not an
                            insuperable impediment to such a flow and holds view that it is probably
                            hardening the North Vietnamese will to continue conflict.</p>
                        <p>3. In conversations with Rumanians and particularly with Poles and
                            Soviets the point was repeatedly made that they could do nothing as long
                            as bombing of North Vietnam and “U.S. aggressive actions” continued.
                            They were especially emphatic regarding bombing of the north.
                            Conversely, however, none indicated what, if anything, they could or
                            would do or what would happen if bombing were stopped. Suspension <pb n="637" xml:id="pg_637" facs="0669"/>of bombing for an appreciable
                            period could perhaps smoke out whether there is any real disposition on
                            part of Eastern Europeans and Soviets to be helpful, although in this
                            connection Senator observed no indication on the part of the Russians of
                            willingness to take action at this time.</p>
                        <p>4. Although originally opposed to bombing, Senator not at all persuaded
                            that an isolated act of suspension at this point would prove fruitful,
                            particularly if it is intended as a measure which, if it fails to
                            produce negotiations, will be followed by a resumption and extension of
                            the bombing.</p>
                        <p>5. Senator feels that if it is attempted at all at this time, it ought to
                            be not “a wait and see” gesture but, rather, coupled with other direct
                            U.S. initiatives, with Poles, Rumanians and, perhaps, even with Chinese
                            in Warsaw.</p>
                        <p>6. Senator suggests, further, that consideration be given not solely to
                            question of suspending North Vietnamese bombing, which involves only a
                            unilateral forbearance on our part but also to a call for a suspension
                            of all hostilities throughout Viet Nam in connection with recent
                            reported Viet Cong offer of a 12 hour cease-fire over Christmas.</p>
                        <p>He believes thought should be given to the practicability of calling upon
                            the Viet Cong to extend this period of cease-fire from Christmas through
                            the important Vietnamese New Year holiday (Tet) which is generally
                            observed for approximately three days beginning January 21 or 22. If it
                            works, this would have virtue of providing substantial period of about
                            one month in which possibility for negotiations may be thoroughly
                            tested. If it does not, it would still be a significant initiative for
                            peace from our side which should have considerable effect on world and
                            domestic opinion.</p>
                        <p>7. In sum, Senator feels that pause in bombing of itself would likely be
                            of doubtful utility in bringing about negotiations at this time unless
                            coupled with broader U.S. initiatives in other fields.</p>

                        <p>I appreciate the magnitude and the difficulty of the decisions you now
                            face in respect to Vietnam. Although I do not want to complicate <pb n="638" xml:id="pg_638" facs="0670"/>your problems or impinge upon
                            the roles of your primary advisers in the national security area, I have
                            myself given a lot of thought to this over the past week-end as a result
                            of the meetings last week. For what they are worth, my views are as
                            follows.</p>
                        <p>The more I think about it, the more I am opposed to a pause in the
                            bombing as the dramatic gesture for peace. I think it is very difficult
                            for a President to order such a pause when the Joint Chiefs of Staff are
                            unanimously opposed to it and when they (to some degree) base their
                            opposition on the ground that the bombing is effective in supporting the
                            effort of 200,000 American boys on the ground in South Vietnam. Further,
                            I think many Americans, including many influential Congressmen, would
                            raise vigorous objections to such a pause and would become aware through
                            one means or another (and through no fault of the Chiefs) of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> views. Finally, I fear that Hanoi may
                            be able to place us in the position of protracted but totally
                            non-productive negotiations with our men still fighting on the
                            ground—only so long as we do not resume bombing. By shrewd diplomacy,
                            they may be able to present us with the dilemma of denying us the
                            benefits of bombing through such pseudo-negotiations or putting the onus
                            of breaking off such negotiations on us for resumption of bombing.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, I believe some dramatic peace gesture is necessary. In
                            part, it can be the trip of <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Averell
                                Harriman</persName> to various capitals of the world. However, I
                            would suggest that some consideration be given to your responding to the
                            12-hour ceasefire proposed by the Viet Cong with a longer
                            ceasefire—perhaps to run from Christmas through Tet (the Vietnamese
                            holiday), with the obvious caveat that our boys would fire in
                            self-defense and resume the attack on ground and in the air if the Viet
                            Cong do not honor the ceasefire. (I do not know how workable in the
                            field a step of this kind is but you might want to have the Defense
                            Department explore the feasibility of an action such as this.) While the

                            American directly to Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>Short of an action such as a ceasefire, and in addition to <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Averell Harriman</persName>'s trip, I believe you
                            might at least offer to send someone directly to Hanoi to try to bring
                            them to the negotiating table.</p>

                            after Dean Rusk's return. (Bob McNamara gets back Wednesday night, but
                            Dean is spending another day on a long scheduled visit to Madrid.) As of
                            Saturday, Rusk and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and
                            all their top subordinates were strongly favorable to the pause. Rusk
                            himself has moved steadily and strongly in that direction over the last
                            two weeks, although he wants you to be absolutely certain that whatever
                            you decide will also be his recommendation. The arguments are
                            wearisomely familiar to you, but the interesting thing to me is that
                            people with very different basic views of the course of the war think
                            that a pause would help now. And no one believes, either that the other
                            side can trap us or that a two-week pause in the North would weaken us
                            in the South.</p>
                        <p>Today <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill Moyers</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName> and I have discussed the
                            wider proposal of a cease-fire and a peace mission to Hanoi in
                            accordance with your instruction to <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName> this morning. This is an idea which has real
                            attractions and real disadvantages. We will be working on it some more
                            tomorrow with <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Cy Vance</persName>, because
                            it turns out—not for the first time—that the people in Defense have done
                            more staff work in this peace proposal than the people in State.</p>
                        <p>The possible advantages of a cease-fire are these:</p>
                        <p>1. To the degree that it is respected by the other side, our casualties
                            stop;</p>
                        <p>2. We get a chance to emphasize peaceful actions and to go about the work
                            of relief and reconstruction, and other works of peace. If the other
                            side allowed such free movement, we should be able to make some money in
                            the countryside. If they did not, it would be plainly their fault.</p>
                        <p>3. If the cease-fire is rejected—which is quite possible—the
                            international political rewards are very great indeed.</p>
                        <p>4. If the cease-fire is accepted, the chances of turning the whole
                            business toward the peace table are considerably greater than they would
                            be with a pause.</p>
                        <pb n="640" xml:id="pg_640" facs="0672"/>
                        <p>The disadvantages a cease-fire offers are also serious:</p>
                        <p>1. The Chiefs and <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> would all be
                            unanimously and very strongly opposed. They would use some or all of the
                            arguments that follow.</p>
                        <p>2. The whole object of our deployment is to get the initiative against
                            the Viet Cong. A cease-fire would hand it back to them and allow them to
                            rest, refit, regroup, retrain, and redouble their resistance after the
                            fighting begins again.</p>
                        <p>3. A cease-fire would gravely shake the morale of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and of the people in Saigon. It would
                            also reopen the whole question of U.S. determination, doubts of which
                            were so near the center of the crisis in morale a year ago.</p>
                        <p>4. A cease-fire offer could convey a very bad signal of apparent weakness
                            to Hanoi. (I don't quite believe in this one myself because if we
                            ourselves use a cease-fire to move around the countryside, we can make
                            things very tough for Hanoi and the Viet Cong both.)</p>
                        <p>5. If the South Vietnamese stop fighting, it may be very hard to get them
                            to start again.</p>
                        <p>My own personal worry about a cease-fire right now is that I doubt if we
                            can get organized to do it right in the short time between now and
                            Christmas. I also believe that it is a card which we can play a little
                            better some distance down the road than we can today. I believe the
                            pause is both easier to defend and easier to execute, and I do not
                            believe that it carries unacceptable costs with the troops in the field
                            or public opinion. I feel this far more strongly because I am quite
                            certain that with careful explanation of the need for a pause as a
                            prelude to cease-fire, we can get the solid support of both <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and if they are with us, I
                            do not fear those who are against us.</p>

                            altogether. He was talking from rough notes, and I asked him to leave

                        <p>1. Primarily to improve morale in South.</p>
                        <p>2. To interdict movement of supplies to South.</p>
                        <p>3. To persuade Hanoi to quit or to come to conference table.</p>
                        <p>Present consequences of bombing:</p>
                        <p>1. Is it fulfilling purposes?</p>
                        <p>a. Not needed to raise morale in South with massive troop
                            deployments.</p>
                        <p>b. Not effective to reduce flow of supplies below critical level although
                            it raises cost.</p>
                        <p>c. It is not breaking popular will of Hanoi but is uniting country
                            against U.S.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Unfavorable aspects:</p>
                        <p>a. Driving Soviet and Peking together when we should be splitting them
                            since Soviets want a pause.</p>
                        <p>b. Prevents possibility of settlement since Communist cannot settle in

                        <pb n="642" xml:id="pg_642" facs="0674"/>
                        <p>The entrance of North Vietnamese troops in large numbers into South
                            Viet-Nam is truly an escalation of the war, with all the serious
                            connotations which attach to the word “escalation”. For Hanoi, it means
                            grave risks; for us it means the grimness of intensified effort.</p>
                        <p>If it were not for the incursion from Hanoi we could be taking some
                            satisfaction from the progress which has been made with regard to the
                            rank and file Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> recently was in a village
                            surrounded by Viet Cong when one defector came into the village and said
                            that he and his comrades simply could not stand the air and artillery
                            attacks anymore, adding that if he was well treated many more of his
                            comrades would come out. He appeared emaciated.</p>
                        <p>Viet Cong defectors to the Chieu Hoi camps during November numbered
                            1,482, the highest monthly total on record, with air and artillery
                            attacks also playing a big part.</p>
                        <p>22 members of a V.C. platoon surrendered a few days ago to the U.S. 173rd
                            Airborne Brigade. This is believed to be one of the largest single
                            groups ever to surrender voluntarily to U.S. forces.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Goure, of the Rand Corporation, told me that his 14 selected
                            Vietnamese investigators had interviewed about 180 Viet Cong prisoners
                            and defectors between July and December of this year. They noted a
                            change as between 1965 and 1964. In 1964, 65 percent believed in victory
                            because they were convinced the Viet Cong had the support of the people.
                            In 1965, only 20 percent believed in victory.</p>
                        <p>This too is due in great part to the jets, the B-52s, artillery and
                            helicopters. In particular, the B-52s had had a big impact with their
                            destruction looming large in Viet Cong eyes because of the comparison of
                            sizes of bomb craters with the sizes of their own dwellings. The air
                            attacks had put the value of their passive defense measures in doubt and
                            made them realize there was no survival by digging.</p>
                        <p>They also had fear of detection and were obsessed with the idea that
                            there were agents among them. The officers of one main force battalion
                            made everybody strip off their clothes so as to look for hidden radios.
                            Defoliation had been effective in enhancing detection. V.C. had adopted
                            the practice of cooking in villages so that the smoke of their cooking
                            would not be detected. If villages were not available, they cooked in
                            special ovens so as to dispel the smoke. These are cumbersome. They also
                            try to put out a fire when a plane appears. The result is that many
                            units are down to one hot meal a day at 3 o'clock in the morning. The
                            average food consumption is one can and a half of cold rice a day. There
                            is much beri-beri. There is also a high rate of malaria in the army of
                            North Viet-Nam.</p>

                            believe, the senior American journalist as regards Viet-Nam, and a
                            former combat correspondent in Korea, believes that success in Viet-Nam
                            is now assured, provided U.S. opinion remains steadfast. He considers
                            this to provide really the only chance for defeat. He believes that
                            Hanoi intends to drag the conflict out until the 1968 Presidential
                            election and is counting on the ending of the war being the issue which
                            will cause an outcome in which the V.C. are still in power in the
                            country-side. Incidentally, he added that there were more casualties
                            after the peace talks began in Panmunjon than there had been in that
                            period preceding the peace talks.</p>

                            that the most important question before us is that of peaceful actions
                            before January. When last heard from, they were both strongly in favor
                            of the pause. Bob and I have been doing further work on the wider notion
                            of a cease-fire in all Vietnam. I do not know his views, but I continue
                            to think we are not ready for this one yet.</p>
                        <p>“Another matter for discussion is Rusk's report on his European trip.
                            Like Bob McNamara he has found the responses pretty thin on Vietnam. But
                            it remains a good thing that he put our case as strongly as he did.”

                        <p>The meeting opened with a discussion of the visit of Prime Minister
                                Wilson.<note n="2" xml:id="d231fn2"> Harold Wilson arrived in New
                                York on December 15 to address the U.N. General Assembly. On
                                December 16, he traveled to Washington for a formal meeting at the
                                White House in the late morning. In the late afternoon, Wilson and
                                Johnson met privately for almost two hours. (Ibid., President's
                                Daily Diary) Wilson described his meeting with the President in <hi rend="italic">A Personal Record</hi>, pp. 186-188. On Vietnam,
                                Wilson recalled that he pressed Johnson for a suspension of the
                                bombing to test North Vietnamese sincerity. Wilson also recalled
                                that he warned the President that if the United States bombed Hanoi
                                and Haiphong, the United Kingdom would have to publicly disassociate
                                itself from such action.</note> Then the President turned to
                            Secretary Rusk, who had just returned from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>,<note n="3" xml:id="d231fn3"> Rusk attended the

                        <p>Did you bring back any peace proposals:</p>
                        <p>Rusk: No. After moving around in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, I
                            find Wilson is a paragon of courage. The rest are doing nothing. I
                            really can't see why the British can't put in men to support the
                            Australians.</p>
                        <p>President: Wilson is going to do nothing. He wants a <gloss target="#t_DSC1">DSC</gloss> for fending off his enemies in
                            Parliament. I think this man Cameron's articles are having a large

                        <p>The Viet Cong atrocities never get publicized. Nothing is being written

                            says his line has been steady since the Baltimore speech. Wilson tells
                            his opposition to bring the Viet Cong to a conference table and he'll
                            produce the President.</p>
                        <p>I'm willing to take any gamble on stopping the bombing if I think I've
                            got some hope of something happening. We must evaluate this very
                            carefully. You have no idea how much I've talked to the Fulbrights and
                            Lippmanns. They're not coming aboard.</p>

                            hurt them enough without 400,000 men to make them behave differently. If
                            we don't, what should we do? We shouldn't be doing anything that has a

                        <p>Perhaps a cease-fire in place.</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: No one can say. If we look
                            hard at bombing in the North, it isn't producing a salutary effect. We
                            started bombing:</p>
                        <p>1) to raise morale</p>
                        <p>2) to interdict supplies</p>
                        <p>3) to get Hanoi to change its mind</p>
                        <p>The first is not needed any more. Bombing hasn't served the other two
                            reasons. We can restrict supplies only to a critical level, no
                            lower.</p>
                        <p>Obviously we are not breaking the will of North Viet-Nam. They are
                            digging in. A hardened line. I was in Charge of bombing surveys in World
                            War II and bombing never wins a war. We are driving the North Vietnamese
                            into a greater dependency on China—and boxing in the Soviets. We are
                            also making plans for negotiation more difficult.</p>
                        <pb n="646" xml:id="pg_646" facs="0678"/>
                        <p>I think the risks of escalation are very great—and the risk is in the
                            North, not in the South. The one hope we have is to stop bombing and
                            seize every opportunity not to resume. Meanwhile, (we should) conduct
                            the war in the South with redoubled vigor.</p>
                        <p>President: That has some appeal to me. The problem is the Chiefs go
                            through the roof when we mention this pause.</p>

                            Chiefs.</p>
                        <p>President: I don't think you can sell the American people on the merits
                            of stopping the bombing.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: The Navy and the Air
                            Force are conducting 3,000 sorties in North Viet-Nam. There is no way to
                            stop bombing in the North except as part of a political move.</p>
                        <p>Rusk: On <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s remarks, I don't
                            think bombing has caused North Viet-Nam to escalate. They are determined
                            to do so.</p>
                        <p>We tell the Russians: you ask us to pause—we pause—now what would you do
                            for us?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: You need several of
                            these moves. We had one pause; we need more.</p>
                        <p>Bundy: Look at what would happen if there wasn't any bombing from the day
                            before Christmas until the day after New Years.</p>
                        <p>President: I have no objections. What are the objections?</p>
                        <p>Rusk: The Russians need more time to get something on with the
                            Chinese.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: If the press asks us
                            why no bombing, we answer we are increasing our effort in Laos and the
                            South.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: Only 40 per cent of the
                            missions are going on now. Concentrate in the South.</p>
                        <p>President: Shouldn't we have someone moving throughout the world trying
                            for peace?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: All the time this is
                            being done we will move toward increasing our forces in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>(President thinking—thoughtful, quiet, obviously concentrating
                            deeply.)</p>
                        <p>President: Is this what you want to explore with the Chiefs?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: No, I need to know
                            what you want. The Chiefs will be totally opposed. (Problem with
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>—he has eye trouble
                            and needs to be operated on.)</p>
                        <p>We decide what we want and impose it on them. They see this as a total
                            military problem—nothing will change their views. They will answer: we
                            are better off now with bombing than without it.</p>
                        <p>President: We are there now because of the bombing. We wouldn't be there
                            without it.</p>
                        <pb n="647" xml:id="pg_647" facs="0679"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: I know exactly what
                            the arguments of the Chiefs are. Before you decide, I cannot deliver.
                            After you decide, I can deliver.</p>
                        <p>Rusk: Work on specific suggestions and get back to the President
                            later.</p>
                        <p>President: I am opposed to announcements of a pause. If you pick weather
                            as an excuse and Christmas as a factor—the position of the allies
                            also—take a poll where they say we are not doing enough to find
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>Take all this—try to sell our enemies that we want peace. We owe this to
                            the American people. We can't do this if we are dropping bombs on the
                            enemy. (Like <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> in
                            Hanoi.)</p>
                        <p>Anything with bombs is bad for the peace effort. Let's put off bombing
                            until we can talk to others.</p>
                        <p>Because of weather, receiving thousands more people, solidifying our
                            position, we can have a pause. Let <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> say to the Chiefs: we've got a heavy budget,
                            tax bill, controls, danger of inflation, kill the great society. With
                            all these things, we've got to make sure the diplomats can talk. They
                            claim they can't talk with bombs dropping. Period: 22 December through
                            22 January.</p>
                        <p>Sometime during this period have <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> come here to the U.S.—or the President go to
                            Honolulu—and look at it—letting the people know what we're doing.</p>
                        <p>Then on the 23rd of January, tell the people where we stand. Meanwhile,
                            try to figure out how to cut losses. Don't believe that bombing will
                            help us.</p>
                        <p>They are right: the weakest chink in our armor is public opinion. Our
                            people won't stand firm—and will bring down the Government.</p>
                        <p>We're going to suffer political losses. Every President does in off
                            years. But it is because of damn fool liberals who are crying about
                            poverty (which funds I doubled in one year). But we need money for all
                            these programs. How do you divide up this money? Every hangover Kennedy
                            columnist is sniping about Johnson cutting off Great Society
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>The only man that helps me survive is Jim Webb. He is trying to reduce
                            funds in his agency. Orville Freeman is a soldier—he's trying.</p>

                        <p>2172. Eyes only for Bundy.</p>
                        <p>1. I received word from Mission officer that a man purporting to be
                            connected with the Viet Cong had said that a V.C. attempt to approach me
                            had been unsuccessful because I was apparently not interested.</p>
                        <p>2. This was so much the reverse of the truth that I told Archbishop
                            Palmas about it so that he would be in a position to clear up any
                            misunderstanding. He vouched for the complete lack of basis for such an
                            idea. On the contrary, he said I had always made it clear that I was
                            interested.</p>
                        <p>3. In fact, Archbishop Palmas will tell his “former Minister” when he
                            sees him that he feels that he had not been dealt with in a correct
                            manner.</p>
                        <p>4. Palmas assumes that either his “former Minister” has been cheated and
                            deceived by the V.C. or there has been an intervention from the north to
                            quash separate peace making activities from among the Viet Cong. A sign
                            of this can be found in the new Viet Cong flag which now contains the
                            hammer and sickle.</p>

                        <p>If the objectives of our policy remain the same, the war in Viet Nam is
                            just beginning for the United States. The ultimate needs cannot be
                            estimated, either as to U.S. manpower, costs or time. Prudence requires,
                            however, that we anticipate a doubling and redoubling of U.S. forces in
                            the next year or two. The truth is that we are up against an open-ended
                            military situation which can eventually spread to encompass Southeast
                            Asia and even China. The war has, in fact, already spilled over into
                            Laos and may be on the verge of involving Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>The end of the road on the basis of present policy is not in sight either
                            in the sense of a military solution or a solution by negotiations. The
                            Communists give no signs of acquiescing in the basic requirement of our
                            present policy which, in effect, is that North Viet Nam either agree to
                            or be compelled “to leave its neighbors alone”. That concept, in any
                            event, is an oversimplified interpretation of the situation. The bulk of
                            Communist manpower in South Vietnam is still South Vietnamese. South
                            Vietnamese and North Vietnamese are all mixed together, on both sides,
                            in this conflict. The disputants are not only “neighbors,” they are also
                            “relatives”.</p>
                        <p>Any immediate prospects of opening a Conference (and they are slim) are
                            not likely to be realized on the “neighbor” concept but, if at all, on
                            the basis of “cease fire and stand fast.” That would appear to be a
                            necessary preliminary to straightening out the complex Vietnamese
                            relationships in general accord with the Geneva Agreements of 1954. A
                            cease fire and stand fast now, as a practical matter, would leave the
                            Viet Cong in control of most of the rural areas, and the government in
                            control of the cities which probably contain in excess of 50% of the
                            total population of South Viet Nam.</p>
                        <p>It is not likely that third parties can be of much help in bringing about
                            a Conference any more than they can be counted on for much real
                            assistance in carrying on the war. Almost without exception, the
                            principal concern other nations have, whether in Europe or in Asia, is
                            staying clear of involvement themselves.</p>
                        <p>The Russians, in particular, are unwilling to help bring about
                            negotiations at this time. Indeed, it may well be that they do not find
                            the present situation at all without benefits from their point of view.
                            The fact is that their principal rivals in the world and in the
                            Communist bloc (the United States and China respectively) are both
                            deeply involved in Viet Nam. The Russians, as of now, are in the clear
                            and have almost a free hand in promoting their position and interests
                            both within the bloc and in the world in general.</p>
                        <p>The most realistic hope (and it is not much) for a conference in the near
                            future would appear to lie in a direct initiative with the Chinese and
                            North Vietnamese and on the initial basis of “cease fire and stand
                            fast.” A possible approach was outlined to Secretary Rusk in a cable on
                            December <pb n="650" xml:id="pg_650" facs="0682"/>10, 1965.<note n="3" xml:id="d233fn3">Text in <ref target="#d227">Document 227.</ref>
                            </note> If a Conference on this basis could be achieved, the present
                            state of the war in Viet Nam would obviously not give the Saigon
                            government and the United States control of all South Viet Nam but we
                            would still have a substantial position for negotiating purposes.</p>
                        <p>If a Conference cannot be brought off at this time, the decision which
                            faces us resolves itself into this: Shall we plunge in further
                            militarily, into depths which are unfathomable and could eventually
                            involve war with China or can we hold a more limited position in South
                            Viet Nam by more limited military means until the Communists come around
                            to negotiations? Apart from the costs in lives and resources which have
                            to be considered in this decision, there is the additional factor of the
                            worldwide consequences of a deeper and more widespread U.S. involvement
                            in Southeast Asia. In my judgment, these consequences are likely to be
                            very adverse to the position of the United States, particularly with
                            respect to Europe and Japan which are, in fact, the only other two major
                            power-seats in the non-Communist world.</p>
                        <p>This is a conflict in which all the choices open to us are bad choices.
                            We stand to lose in Viet Nam by restraint; but we stand to lose far more
                            at home and throughout the world by the more extensive military pursuit
                            of an elusive objective in Viet Nam.</p>

                            BOMBING</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Assumptions</p>
                        <p>(1) Bombing would be suspended from December 22 and the U.S. must keep
                            free to continue or end the suspension as the President determines. An
                            internal planning assumption is that suspension might last through
                            Vietnamese New Year, which comes on January 21, 22 and 23.</p>
                        <p>(2) The U.S. will make absolute minimum of official public comment on the
                            suspension of the bombing, as such. The U.S. instead will emphasize
                            during the suspension the overriding need for unconditional peace talks
                            and will make it clear that all of its actions at every level—political,
                            military, and diplomatic—are directed at achieving a peaceful
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Official Public Statements</p>
                        <p>(1) Within the next few days, and not later than December 22, the
                            Secretary of State makes a major statement on peace in Vietnam. He
                            rehearses the full list of our efforts to start negotiations. He
                            re-states and re-emphasizes our readiness for free elections and Geneva
                            agreements and the other elements of our strong diplomatic position as
                            last developed by the President on July 28. He rededicates the U.S. to
                            this search for peace and hails the readiness of Prime Minister Wilson
                            to do his best. He announces on behalf of the President that Vice
                            President <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName> and Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> will be proceeding
                            to friendly and neutral capitals right after Christmas to explain in
                            full the U.S. position and to enlist the help of all concerned in moving
                            toward peace.</p>
                        <p>(2) On December 22 bombing is suspended in the North, but without
                            comment. This position of “no comment” is rigorously sustained at every
                            official headquarters, and there is no comment on background either,
                            until the President gives the word.</p>
                        <p>(3) At a time determined by the President, the White House Press
                            Secretary responds to questions on the suspension by saying that every
                            action of the U.S. is related to two purposes: first, to turn back the
                            aggressor in the South, and second, to open the way to peaceful
                            settlements. This comment is echoed precisely by all U.S. officials. All
                            officials continue to draw attention to the statement of the Secretary
                            of State and to the diplomatic missions of the Vice President and
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>.</p>
                        <pb n="652" xml:id="pg_652" facs="0684"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Background comments</p>
                        <p>At times directed by the President, the following background comments
                            will be made by officers of the appropriate departments:</p>
                        <p>(1) Our military effort in the South is being sustained and intensified.
                            The deployments continue and the aircraft not being used in the North
                            are being redirected against Laos and South Vietnam where they have work
                            to do. The South is where the contest will be decided. (Defense)</p>
                        <p>(2) The fact that there is no bombing is directly related to the desire
                            to create a favorable environment of response for the Secretary's speech
                            and the <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> missions. We do not wish to
                            have this series of peace appeals punctuated by the sound of bombs
                            exploding in the North. (State)</p>
                        <p>(3) The suspension of the bombing carries no serious military risks
                            because</p>
                        <p>—the aircraft are doing their job elsewhere;</p>
                        <p>—the weather is bad over North Vietnam this month anyway;</p>
                        <p>—reconnaissance continues over North Vietnam;</p>
                        <p>—if no progress is made toward peace, we can catch up later in the North
                            (Defense).</p>
                        <p>(4) the whole peace effort, including the suspension of the bombing, has
                            two purposes: to open the way for peace if possible, and to prove to men
                            of good will in every country the good faith of the U.S. in its
                            commitment to a peaceful settlement. (State)</p>
                        <p>(5) If this peace effort does not work, the prospect of more and heavier
                            fighting is real, because the determination of the U.S. is unchanged.
                            (every one)</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Very deep background or off the record</p>
                        <p>(1) This effort is the necessary peace punch to go with the military
                            punch which is coming in January. We face a big budget, larger
                            reinforcements, and possibly other drastic measures in the field of
                            taxes and controls. The President cannot ask the American people to join
                            in united support of these hard measures until we have given complete
                            proof of our determination to move toward peace, if possible.
                            (Defense)</p>
                        <p>(2) This peace effort, including the suspension of bombing, is designed
                            to give an opening for debate and pressure for a peace conference within
                            the Communist world. We make no comment at all about what one Communist
                            capital may be saying to another, but we do know that it has been hard
                            for any of them to speak of peace while a Socialist country was being
                            bombed. We hope they are making the most of the suspension. (State)</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Literally eyes only for Ambassador from President.</p>
                        <p>1. I am determined to leave no stone unturned in pursuit of a peaceful
                            settlement of the war consistent with our objective of an independent
                            and secure South Viet-Nam. But over the past few weeks we have been
                            repeatedly told by the Soviet Union, representatives of various Eastern
                            European countries, our Western Allies and various significant leaders
                            of American opinion that effective steps toward peace are difficult if
                            not impossible while North Viet-Nam is under air bombardment.</p>
                        <p>2. None of us has illusions that a suspension of bombing would be likely
                            to lead to acceptable peace moves by Hanoi. But before taking the
                            critical next steps that I now face, I must satisfy myself, the American
                            people, and the world that every opportunity has been provided for
                            peaceful initiatives. If it did nothing else we have reason to believe
                            that a suspension could add to the strains and dissensions in the
                            Communist camp and make it easier for Moscow to avoid deep
                            involvement.</p>
                        <p>3. These next steps include budget increases of many billions of dollars
                            which will become public in January, the deployment of large numbers of
                            additional men during 1966 and the acceptance of stepped-up casualties
                            associated with such increased deployments.</p>
                        <p>4. I am confident the American people will be prepared to do whatever is
                            necessary to see the struggle to a successful conclusion and that our
                            additional efforts will have the support of most of our friends around
                            the world. But it appears to me that sustained support for these very
                            difficult undertakings can be best assured by one further measure to
                            satisfy the world that America is doing everything possible to create
                            the conditions that will facilitate progress toward peace.</p>
                        <p>5. With these considerations in mind—and after an exhaustive balancing of
                            all implications and consequences—I have decided to order the suspension
                            of air attacks on <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> beginning December
                            22 in order to permit opportunity for both Communist and friendly
                            countries to exercise all diplomatic initiatives they can and will
                            undertake. For the moment no decision will be made as to precise
                            duration of suspension. This will depend on progress of diplomatic
                            efforts being undertaken by our friends and on both the words and the
                            actions of Hanoi. We will, of course intensify our efforts in the South,
                            and continue our actions against infiltration routes in Laos. We will
                            also continue unarmed reconnaissance over <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="654" xml:id="pg_654" facs="0686"/>
                        <p>6. I do not contemplate any public announcement of suspension. At the
                            beginning, the stand-down may hopefully be related to weather
                            conditions. As attention becomes focused on continued suspension we
                            shall publicly explain it as a step in the search for peace. At the same
                            time the press can be informed on background basis that suspension is
                            taking place during period when weather conditions in Viet-Nam limit
                            effectiveness of bombing. Press will certainly draw its own conclusions
                            about relation of suspension to the Christmas season.</p>
                        <p>7. But while there will be no public announcement we do plan quietly to
                            inform various key governments, including certain Communist governments,
                            which have indicated interest in some diplomatic initiative. Moreover I
                            shall dispatch various emissaries to key capitals to explore
                            possibilities of probing intentions and encouraging diplomatic
                            initiatives.</p>
                        <p>8. I know of your own reservations regarding any suspension of bombing
                            and am fully aware of possible costs and dangers. Nevertheless, I feel
                            that this action is a necessary preparation for the difficult days that
                            lie ahead.</p>
                        <p>9. I also recognize the delicate and complicated problem you will face in
                            handling this matter with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. This
                            will draw on your best diplomatic resources. We must emphasize to the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> that the American determination
                            is unswerving but that before entering into a new and more costly phase
                            of the conflict requiring a very much greater US effort we must satisfy
                            our people and the world that all measures are being exhausted to bring
                            about peace on a basis consistent with the objectives for which we are
                            both fighting. Our stake is so large in this enterprise that we cannot
                            permit the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to veto this essential
                            measure.</p>
                        <p>10. I leave it to your best judgment how to approach <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. I know you will bear in mind the
                            serious problem of premature leaks. You carry a very high responsibility
                            and I know I can trust you to do everything possible in bringing off
                            this difficult but essential undertaking.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>I wish to inform you confidentially in advance that on December ___ we
                            will suspend our bombing operations against North Vietnam. We are taking
                            this step fully conscious of the risks involved. One of these is that
                            the other side may take advantage of our action to step up the
                            intervention in South Vietnam. We will, therefore, continue our
                            reconnaissance of North Vietnam. Another risk is that the authorities in
                            Hanoi and Peiping may interpret our action as a sign of weakness or lack
                            of determination to carry out our commitment to the Government and
                            people of South Vietnam. This risk is heightened by the fact that as
                            always is the case in a society such as ours when controversial issues
                            are under public discussion, a small minority has come out in opposition
                            to our policy in Southeast Asia. I am sure that on the basis of reports
                            from you and other sources your government can put these manifestations
                            in their proper perspective. I am not so sure that this is the case in
                            Hanoi and Peiping.</p>
                        <p>The resistance to the North Vietnamese controlled and directed
                            hostilities in South Vietnam will continue but can quickly be brought to
                            an end either by formal negotiations or by the simple cessation of North
                            Vietnamese intervention. I realize that we do not have a common view of
                            the past history of this affair but I am hopeful that we do hold in
                            common a desire to see peace restored in that unhappy land; to see the
                            killing and the terrorism ended and the long-suffering people of this
                            area given the opportunity to devote their lives to peaceful pursuits in
                            which we stand ready to assist them. As we have repeatedly stated, we
                            seek no military bases or other advantages in this area and we believe
                            that the Geneva Accords of 1954 could furnish the basis for a
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>I can assure you of our sincerity when I tell you that we are determined
                            to live up to our commitments but that peace is our objective and that
                            the action of which we are informing your Government has no other
                            purpose.</p>

                            CAPITALS</p>
                        <p>The President requests that you call on Chief of Government before the
                            close of business on __________ to give him the following personal
                            message from the President.</p>
                        <p>“I want you to know that in pursuit of the objective set forth in my
                            address at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, I have instructed the
                            Secretary of State to conduct a renewed and intensive effort to move the
                            problem of Vietnam to the peace table. I have asked the Secretary to
                            coordinate a number of efforts of all sorts, public and private, to
                            persuade the Government of North Vietnam of the importance of moving in
                            this direction.</p>
                        <p>“In order to insure the most favorable possible environment for this
                            effort, I have agreed with the Government of Vietnam that there will be
                            a suspension of the bombing in North Vietnam beginning on December
                            ______.</p>
                        <p>“In all its actions in Vietnam, my Government has aimed from the first
                            for a peaceful settlement. These new actions are a part of this same
                            policy and purpose. It is my hope that the climate that should result
                            will make it possible for your Government to take initiatives of its own
                            in furtherance of the objective of a peaceful settlement. I have asked
                            my Ambassador to be available to you at any time for further discussion
                            of these matters.”</p>
                        <p>For the Ambassador's information: Unarmed reconnaissance of North Vietnam
                            will continue and we will be alert to and reserve full freedom of action
                            to deal with any aggressive actions that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> may take which are clearly contrary to our objective of
                            peaceful solutions. We also expect to maintain and even accelerate the
                            pace of military action in South Vietnam. In your discretion you should
                            insure that these elements of our policy are understood.</p>

                        <p>Amateur excursions into diplomacy can cost you greatly. But having to
                            reply to it, it destroyed its effectiveness. We can't conduct

                        <p>(I would treat missions without mentioning or pointing up. After the

                            mission. It would get nowhere.)</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: That's baloney—and I
                            can prove it.</p>
                        <p>President: I don't think so. I disagree. I think it contains serious
                            military risks. It is inaccurate to say suspension of bombing carries no
                            military risk.</p>
                        <p>Bundy and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: We can resume
                            bombing at any time.</p>
                        <p>President: If we're confronted with 60-100,000 more men, and we didn't
                            anticipate it, that's an error. If they fix all their bridges and
                            transportation … (I thought we took this power plant out.)</p>
                        <p>Rusk: I don't believe the suspension will last to January 27 unless we
                            are well on the way toward peace.</p>

                        <p>President: I agree. It could be of very short duration.</p>
                        <p>Bundy: It would be better to start on the 23rd or 24th.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: It would leak if we

                            Start Wednesday the 22nd.</p>
                        <p>Bundy: Which is then Thursday, their time. If you go to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, the pause ought to come right after.</p>
                        <p>Think carefully about if there is a turnaround on Lodge's part. The
                            question is do we want to know more before we push the button. If he
                            says the situation would collapse, you may want to know more.</p>
                        <p>President: What does <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Max Taylor</persName>
                            think? How would he vote?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: On balance, “no”. But
                            he would vote with the Presidnt.</p>
                        <p>Bundy: This is not what he considers his arena.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: He thinks the military
                            program and pacification is going better than it is.</p>
                        <p>President: Why do it the 22nd? Why not the 7th or 8th?</p>
                        <p>Bundy: Christmas time is a good time psychologically—also get it started
                            before Congress comes back.</p>
                        <p>President: If you wind up bombing during New Year, wouldn't it be better
                            to do it during their New Year?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: Wouldn't it be better to do
                            it before Congress comes back?</p>
                        <p>President: Incidentally, do we want a personal State of the Union
                            message? Clark, I want you to think about this. My inclination is not to
                            speak in person. We wrote an 8-year program in our first State of the
                            Union message. We've got all this the first year.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCJW1">McCormack</persName> thinks personal
                            delivery will help elect the Congress. I don't agree.</p>
                        <p>Rusk: I disagree. If you didn't, you would be giving up your leadership,
                            here and abroad. I do have objection to a 9 p.m. appearance.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: I don't think you have
                            to go before Congress to assert leadership. You ought not to go unless
                            (the message) has something to say.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>: I think it would be a
                            serious mistake if you didn't go in person. Last year you laid out a
                            domestic program. This time you report on the shape of the program.</p>
                        <p>I think, after your illness, failure to appear would be injurious to
                            world leadership. To break a long standing custom would be serious.</p>
                        <p>Rusk: If we were at peace in Viet-Nam, it might be alright, but not
                            now.</p>
                        <p>President: I think there is a good deal to what Cliff says.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>: I would do it on the
                            11th or 12th.</p>
                        <p>President: We could do it on Monday, the 10th, the first day. That's what
                            we did last year.</p>

                        <p>(After reading the position paper on a pause)</p>
                        <p>It rankles me that we have to prove again to Congress we are striving for
                            peace. We've done that again and again.</p>
                        <p>Rusk: It's “What have you done for me lately?”</p>
                        <p>President: Would we read about the suspension on the 23rd?</p>
                        <p>Bundy: The British will probably leak it.</p>
                        <p>President: Who will you tell about this?</p>
                        <p>Rusk: The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Thailand, Australia, New
                            Zealand, Korea, Canada, India, Japan, the Philippines. We need to tell
                            them something within 36 hours.</p>
                        <p>Alex Johnson: After the first Saigon briefing of no mention of an attack
                            on the North, the press will be hounding us.</p>
                        <p>President: You better move your dates back. I'm not ready to do anything
                            yet. We have a lot of talking to do.</p>
                        <p>Dean, tell me what you think will be achieved by execution of this
                            recommendation of a pause?</p>
                        <p>Rusk: First, there is the underlying question of the American people.
                            They are isolationists at heart. (I am) convinced the people will do
                            what has to be done in a war situation if they are convinced there is no
                            alternative. You must think about the morale of the American people if
                            the other side keeps pushing.</p>
                        <p>We must be able to say that all has been done.</p>
                        <p>President: Haven't we done this?</p>
                        <p>Rusk: To my satisfaction, but perhaps not to that of the American
                            people.</p>
                        <p>Second, it's our deepest national purpose to achieve our goal by peace
                            not war. If there is one chance in ten or twenty, a step of this sort
                            could lead to a settlement on the Geneva agreements and 17th parallel I
                            would take it. One chance in twenty is my guess.</p>
                        <p>Try to create a heavy obligation on the Russians' part to settle. If we
                            pause, they will owe us something. The Russians, Yugoslavs, Hungarians
                            have all pressed this with me. There is a possibility of deception.</p>
                        <p>President: They are pretty good at that, aren't they?</p>
                        <p>Rusk: If there is a chance Russia would take advantage of a suspension to
                            start a movement toward peace, it is good. If it fails …</p>
                        <p>(I am) influenced by the fact Russia and Iron Curtain countries acted in
                            India-Pakistan crisis.</p>
                        <p>Also they don't want China policy to win. Also, they don't want a
                            confrontation with the United States over Southeast Asia policy.</p>
                        <pb n="661" xml:id="pg_661" facs="0693"/>
                        <p>If it moves to the U.S. and China directly engaged, they have a deadly
                            problem. This worries them. This ought to be clarified. We may get this
                            clarified on the 3rd day like the last time.</p>
                        <p>A minor point (it would) make sure the world knows the U.S. is not the
                            obstacle to peace. Those who support us will find it easy to support
                            us.</p>
                        <p>President: From a propaganda point, there is a long shot chance. First,
                            the Russians owe us something; second, it gives supporters reasons to go
                            along with the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Rusk: Possibility of trap—parlay pause into unilateral pause.</p>
                        <p>President: Do we eliminate this by keeping the pause on an indefinite
                            time limit?</p>
                        <p>Rusk: Right.</p>
                        <p>Another concern is a pause that fails. It will bring pressure to go all
                            out to get it settled.</p>
                        <p>President: That is the most dangerous aspect. Don't we know a pause will
                            fail? If we are in worse shape then, won't we be bringing a deadly
                            crisis on ourselves? The Republicans are looking for an exit. When we
                            suffer reverses, it will be attributable to this. The support we have
                            will be weak as dishwater.</p>
                        <p>Rusk: The answer to Dirksen is that no real settlement came from Korea …
                            They allowed North Viet-Nam to become communist.</p>
                        <p>President: Bob?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: The Soviets have not
                            applied all the pressure they could.</p>
                        <p>President: Have they ever applied pressure?</p>
                        <p>Rusk: Yes. During the first pause. They said they didn't have time.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Our first pause was a
                            propaganda effort. It was a propaganda effort—not for the Soviets to
                            help.</p>
                        <p>Rusk: Another indication is that the Russians have waged a great struggle
                            against China.</p>
                        <p>President: Do we gain anything by doing this on the heels of the Italian
                                move?<note n="4" xml:id="d235fn4">See <ref target="#d205">Document

                        </p>
                        <p>Rusk: There is some disagreement in the timing. (One) the hardliners say
                            you paused in the face of Hanoi's intransigence. (Two) the leftwing says
                            you are pausing because you don't believe anything will happen.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: My point is they
                            haven't made all the effort they are capable of.</p>
                        <pb n="662" xml:id="pg_662" facs="0694"/>
                        <p>President: How do you know that? Have they talked with you?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: No. No contacts. This
                            comes from State.</p>
                        <p>This pause will give us leverage on them. It stops them from precipitous
                            action against us—such as an amphibious landing. Such Russian action is
                            less likely if we pause.</p>
                        <p>I think there is some movement from the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. We don't really understand the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> reactions. We don't really know. We are out of
                            communication. (There is) danger because of this. (There is a) bare
                            chance this pause will help them move toward us.</p>
                        <p>President: What does <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> say
                            about the Russians?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: It would relieve them of
                            intense pressure on response to our actions. (There is) more danger of
                            Russian response than Chinese response. So we must push them into a
                            corner.</p>
                        <p>Rusk: Suppose the Russians were trying to avoid a confrontation with the
                            U.S.? What are those Americans up to?</p>
                        <p>(The President left the room to take a phone call at 1:40. He re-entered
                            at 1:50 p.m.)</p>
                        <p>Bundy: We don't think you should contact Ford of the House of
                            Representatives. He will denounce us.</p>
                        <p>(The President did not answer.)</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: 1. The Soviets have
                            not applied all the pressure they are capable of.</p>
                        <p>2. Action stops Russians from responding as forcefully to our attacks
                            …</p>
                        <p>3. North Viet-Nam might make a favorable movement. We don't know enough
                            of their reactions to judge.</p>
                        <p>4. Suspension of bombing will widen the gap between the Russians and
                            Chinese.</p>
                        <p>5. Strong feeling of American public that Government peace efforts have
                            been superficial and inadequate.</p>
                        <p>6. Military solution to problem is not certain—one out of three or one in
                            two. Ultimately we must find solution, we must finally find a diplomatic
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>President: Then, no matter what we do in military (field) there is no
                            sure victory.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: That's right. We have
                            been too optimistic. One in three or two in three is my estimate.</p>
                        <p>Rusk: I'm more optimistic, but I can't prove it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: I'm saying: we may not
                            find a military solution. We need to explore other means. It is
                            impossible to negotiate a settlement we find acceptable.</p>

                        <p>Rusk: I don't agree. The other side knows South Viet-Nam is not going to
                            negotiate on uneven terms.</p>

                            approach is an unacceptable way to successful conclusions.</p>

                            they quit and come to the conference table?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Right. This seems a
                            contradiction. I come to you for a huge increase in Viet-Nam—400,000
                            men. But at the same time it may lead to escalation and undesirable
                            results. I suggest we look now at other alternatives.</p>
                        <p>1. Military advantage to North Viet-Nam infiltration. I don't think it is
                            serious—small advantage to North Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>2. Possibility North Viet-Nam will interpret a pause as a sign of
                            weakness.</p>
                        <p>3. May lead to trouble with Lodge and the South Vietnam. It doesn't make
                            any difference what or who is in South Viet-Nam—don't worry about
                            them.</p>

                        <p>President: I differ with you. I think <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and the South Vietnamese government are problems.

                            This pressure is only in terms of the North.</p>

                        <p>Bundy: For the pause. Share <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> view that settlement must be political. This
                            will be form of diplomatic initiative.</p>
                        <p>President: I'm not in position to quote Wheeler on pros or cons of pause.
                            He is a good soldier and will follow Commander-in-Chief. Don't think his
                            views are emotional. He is loyal to McNamara and me— —but has
                            convictions … point up systematically his views.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Whatever decision you

                        <p>Bundy: If we are going to do a pause, I'd much rather have done it before
                            the Congress comes back.</p>
                        <p>Fortas: Divide into two parts:</p>
                        <p>1. Military effects.</p>
                        <p>2. Psychological and political aspects.</p>
                        <p>Political effects on this country:</p>
                        <p>(1) Case is not proven. Believe this action will be good—if it results in
                            some kind of conference or suspension of hostilities.</p>
                        <p>Think public reaction will be negative—showing uncertainty. Always think
                            there is possibility of error in assessing public opinion. What they
                            really want is cessation of hostilities. Not very much point in
                            responding to manifestation of public opinion that says “you're not
                            doing enough”.</p>
                        <p>Anytime there is evidence of lack of certainty on the government's part,
                            it leads to negative thinking in the public mind. It will cause people
                            to worry about depth of conviction in government objective.</p>
                        <p>Negative on net balance.</p>
                        <p>Real question—on whether this action should be taken—is whether this
                            action results in actual accomplishment.</p>
                        <p>As I understand it, this action will not be done with pre-arrangement
                            with Russians. This is an action ambivalent and ambiguous. We use the
                            Christmas season—and by that fact and presentation we are diluting the
                            effort [effect] in its hoped-for psychological and political results.
                            Also diluting effect on Russians—and any bringing about of peace
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Concerned as to what happens if this fails.</p>
                        <p>If failure, we won't get credit for it. There will be renewed pressure
                            for drastic action. We'll have obstacles to negotiations because of
                            failure of major and spectacular effort.</p>
                        <p>President: What do you think? What would be the value?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Fortas</persName>: If we could do this by
                            pre-arrangement with the Russians: “If we would finally consider a
                            pause, would this give you an opportunity to get the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to the conference table?”</p>
                        <p>President: We've already done this with the Russians.</p>
                        <pb n="665" xml:id="pg_665" facs="0697"/>
                        <p>Bundy: We don't think we can put them in a corner. The paper to the
                            Russians is drafted carefully to go as far as we can with the
                            Russians.</p>
                        <p>Rusk: We've tried to engage the Soviets in the Viet-Nam settlement but
                            Moscow can't deliver Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Fortas</persName>: This venture depends on
                            the Russians using our actions for some purpose with North Viet-Nam. All
                            I do is raise the question as to whether we have adequate reason for
                            assumption.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: This assumption is not
                            based on one conversation, but on a number of them. Very often the means
                            used by communists is not direct. Also this assumption is based on
                            direct conversation with the Soviets. If we paused, the Soviets tell us
                            they will do the best they can (based on twenty or more
                            conversations).</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Fortas</persName>: There is danger Hanoi
                            would greet a pause as visible evidence that protests have had effect on
                            the U.S. Government.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: The thing that offsets that
                            is heavy deployment in the South.</p>
                        <p>Alex Johnson: We can't have it said by Hanoi and China that Russia is
                            conspiring with the United States.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>: Arguments for pause are
                            well presented. Even if I accepted them, I still feel deep concern over
                            this move.</p>
                        <p>1. Tried to figure out the circumstance under which North Viet-nam would
                            talk. Only their belief they are not going to win the war in South
                            Viet-Nam. I don't believe they are at that stage now. I think they
                            believe they are not losing. They are sending large numbers of men down.
                            They have the example of the French before them. They believe that
                            ultimately the United States will tire of this and go home and North
                            Viet-Nam will prevail. Until they know they're not going to win the war,
                            they will not talk and the Russians cannot convince them.</p>
                        <p>2. Believe the President and the government have talked enough about
                            peace. Don't believe any more talk will do any good. Any objective
                            citizen knows the government's position. Talk of peace is interpreted as
                            a sign of weakness.</p>
                        <p>This pause would encourage North Viet-Nam—take this to be a step
                            backward, in response to U.S. protest opinion and world opinion.</p>
                        <p>Anything that hinders the North Viet-Namese from figuring they can't win
                            hinders the close of the war.</p>
                        <p>3. When the time comes to resume (and it will resume because chances are
                            only one in twenty or one in fifty) those who want peace at any price,
                            who want us to get out are … that we not resume. They will urge enough …
                            events to happen to encourage the pause to go on.</p>
                        <p>4. If you accept the hypothesis that there is no chance of success,
                            others will know it too. And I don't like the President to take a
                            posture that is clearly unproductive. Might end up being viewed as a
                            gimmick. Timing during Christmas is unfortunate.</p>
                        <pb n="666" xml:id="pg_666" facs="0698"/>
                        <p>5. Don't believe Viet-Nam is going to be settled publicly. <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> publicized trips will not
                            settle anything. Only when Hanoi feels nothing to be gained by further
                            fighting is this war going to end.</p>
                        <p>6. If Soviets believe it is to their best interest to take favorable
                            steps, they can do it at any time. Simply because bombing is going on
                            will not stop them from intervening.</p>
                        <p>7. Time might come when pause would be valuable—if we thought there was a
                            chance it would be successful, then and only then would I do it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: Think we make a mistake in
                            feeling Hanoi has freedom of action. They can no more give up this war
                            alone than we would let Saigon fall. It's what the communist powers
                            believe is the right course. The bombing immobilizes China and the

                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Should we pursue
                            military estimate of 50-50 chance of victory—or what should we do?</p>
                        <p>Rusk: In carrying the political battle, I need something more than we
                            have at the present time. We need to make clear that the United States
                            is honorable and has been given no alternative. We strengthen our
                            position by proving we want peace.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Fortas</persName>: Seems to me you have
                            already made your case for peace. Perhaps it looks different on the
                            inside than it does on the outside.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: If we put in 400,000
                            men, what will they do? They will match us. We are going to be bombing
                            assets of North Viet-Nam dearer to them than the ones we are bombing.
                            China is beginning to ready planes to meet us in the skies. It appears
                            that <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>s are being introduced into
                            North Viet-Nam. They are getting ready for escalation—and will call on
                            Russia. They don't want to confront us in Vietnam—they want a way
                            out.</p>

                            know a diplomatic offensive is going on on behalf of the Russians. If
                            North Viet-Nam says “no” to the Soviets, they have a way out when North
                            Viet-Nam calls on them for more arms and men.</p>
                        <p>President: Dean, have you given any thought to me going to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>?</p>
                        <p>Rusk: Yes. It is related to whether or not you envisage doing the pause.
                            If you are going up to greet and thank the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on their last day—a short statement—recount the main
                            elements of our policy—also try to look beyond Viet-Nam—and the hopes of
                            mankind all over the world—education, health and peace—that kind of
                            twenty minute visit would be worthwhile. It would be particularly
                            worthwhile if you do the pause.</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Not so sure if you are
                            not going to pause. Want to see the speech before final decision.</p>
                        <p>President: Anything further to be gained between the Secretary or
                            Goldberg and the Russians—on the basis: We will do this if you will
                            follow through? Tell them: Here's what we want to do if you will
                            acknowledge that you will do something.</p>
                        <p>Bundy: You're never going to be in a position to be in partnership with
                            the Russians. They will always deny being in league with a capitalistic
                            power.</p>
                        <p>Rusk: Moscow, Poland and Hungary have been in touch with Hanoi. We have
                            never heard from Poland and Hungary.</p>
                        <p>If we don't do this, have we any other diplomatic moves we can make—any
                            approaches with any other government?</p>
                        <p>(Silence for a few minutes)</p>
                        <p>Rusk: We could take it to the Security Council if the Russians didn't
                            veto and ask the Secretary General to go to Hanoi. We could press the
                            Hungarian channel pretty hard—they are in touch with Moscow.</p>
                        <p>I worry about bringing this to the assembly in view of the Rhodesia
                            question.</p>
                        <p>We could continue these discussions of which we have had a lot.</p>
                        <p>President: Did Wilson say anything about this?<note n="6" xml:id="d235fn6">See <ref target="#d235fn2">footnote 2</ref>, <ref target="#d231">Document 231</ref>.</note> I don't know.</p>
                        <p>Rusk: He was very relaxed about it.</p>
                        <p>President: He asked me about the 12-hour truce.</p>
                        <p>Rusk: That should be left to local commanders. It's not very long.</p>
                        <p>President: Let's outline all other courses and see them.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: We have just about
                            exhausted third party contacts based on what we have given them about
                            our position.</p>
                        <p>President: But the Viet Cong haven't done anything. They get a lot of hay
                            by just talking.</p>
                        <p>Bundy: If we had a newspaper in Hanoi not under their control, we could
                            do more (laughter).</p>
                        <p>Down the road there are a lot of areas we haven't done—such as formulas
                            on when they shoot and we shoot back as we move around Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>We could plow a straight furrow during winter and spring and clean out
                            the South—and put the onus of continued fighting on them.</p>
                        <p>I would like to get the diplomatic experience of this pause. We have a
                            lot of diplomatic maneuvering to do.</p>
                        <pb n="668" xml:id="pg_668" facs="0700"/>
                        <p>Rusk: One of the pitfalls is that a new situation can always turn out
                            different. For example, lifting of the Berlin blockade came as a
                            surprise. In the Pusan peninsula, we thought we couldn't hang on—and we
                            did.</p>
                        <p>I have a feeling that the other side is not that tough—and it does not
                            follow in a year or two we won't be in the far more favorable position.
                            I think the other side is hurting just as we are hurting.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>: We could make quite a
                            case that our stand is producing good results by preventing the Viet
                            Cong from achieving their objective. Perhaps we can connect beneficial
                            events in Indonesia with our presence in Viet-Nam. At heart we are
                            preventing a communist takeover in Viet-Nam and that is to our
                            credit.</p>
                        <p>Rusk: I presume you don't think we can put a greatly increased offensive?
                            (to <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>)</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: No. We are increasing
                            but so are the Viet Cong. We have 34 U.S. battalions plus 7 more soon,
                            plus 10 Australian and others. South Viet-Nam has 600,000 men. The Viet
                            Cong have 240,000 (probably two or three North Vietnamese divisions—and
                            increasing). By the end of January, 230,000 U.S. and others.</p>
                        <p>President: What do you think we ought to do if we don't pause, Bob?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: As a minimum, carry on
                            the military buildup.</p>
                        <p>Study the possibility of a ceasefire, which I would recommend in a few
                            months, whether as a propaganda device or a military standstill.</p>
                        <p>President: Any solid information of increasing of North Vietnamese
                            activities?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Stepped-up
                            infiltration to 1500 a month through Laos. Soon up to 4,000 a month—this
                            has not been proved, however. About a year ago they began bringing in
                            regular troops instead of cadres. About nine regiments of regulars are
                            there. They have substantially expanded facilities.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Fortas</persName>: What would the Viet Cong
                            propose in this 12-hour truce?</p>
                        <p>Alex Johnson: They said that soldiers without arms would not be attacked
                            for 12 hours.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Fortas</persName>: If we are concerned about
                            public opinion, this is something we ought to consider carefully. This
                            would be capable of producing an adverse reaction in this country.</p>
                        <p>President: Mac, would you undertake to lay out a speech for Tuesday?</p>
                        <p>Dean, would you lay out alternatives available to us?</p>
                        <p>Alex, do you have any strong views. If you were President what would you
                            do?</p>
                        <p>Alex Johnson: I'd take the pause—if for no other reason than to engage
                            the Russians.</p>
                        <pb n="669" xml:id="pg_669" facs="0701"/>
                        <p>President: Couldn't we engage them by saying we are ready to stop if the
                            Viet Cong are?</p>
                        <p>Alex Johnson: No, I don't think we can without a bombing pause.</p>
                        <p>President: What troubles me more is their doubt as to our will to see
                            this thing through.</p>
                        <p>What problems do we get into if we don't bomb on Christmas—and tell the
                            Russians what we are doing—and that we might do more?</p>
                        <p>You say the Russians won't and can't do any more unless we stop bombing.
                            And they probably won't do anything.</p>

                        <p>I attach two papers which you commissioned yesterday afternoon.</p>
                        <p>At Tab A is a memorandum from Dean Rusk on alternative diplomatic
                            actions. As he points out himself, the proposals are modest—not because
                            of caution, but because there simply is not much more that we can do by
                            diplomatic means alone.</p>
                        <p>At Tab B is a draft speech for your use in the United Nations.<note n="2" xml:id="d236fn2">Not printed. (Ibid.)</note> It is very much of a
                            first draft, and it needs a lot of cutting and polishing. There are
                            three points worth making about it:</p>
                        <p>1. It includes an announcement of a pause. I know this is not something
                            you are planning to do, but I thought it important to have a try at the
                            right kind of language because Art <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> has told me most emphatically that he thinks it
                            would be a great mistake for you to go to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> if you do not have some sort of dramatic announcement to
                            make. I can't think of any other.</p>
                        <p>2. I have included a pretty full discussion of the international programs
                            which are now being prepared by <persName corresp="#p_CJA1">Joe
                                Califano</persName>'s office in the fields <pb n="670" xml:id="pg_670" facs="0702"/>of food, health and education. I have
                            also drafted a pretty bold statement on population policy. I feel sure
                            that Joe would recommend strongly against such a discussion of major
                            elements of your 1966 program in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            forum. But we have given all the general assurances before, and without
                            something concrete, this part of the speech would have little
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>3. I have reviewed your speech to the 20th Anniversary celebration in San
                            Francisco, and I attach a copy at Tab C,<note n="3" xml:id="d236fn3">For
                                text of the speech given on June 25, see <hi rend="italic">Public
                                    Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>, 1965</hi>,
                                Book II, pp. 703-706.</note> because I think it shows the problem we
                            are up against. That speech was thoughtful and eloquent, but it had
                            little hard news in it, and it got a disappointing reception. Unless we
                            go beyond it in some clearly specific way, we run the risk of a renewal
                            of this same line of argument—that the Johnson Administration takes no
                            real interest in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and has nothing
                            of importance to tell it.</p>
                        <p>I think there may well be some way of stating our Vietnam position which
                            is a little less precise about the pause but which still has some news
                            and punch in it, and I will have another look at that problem this
                            evening. But I send you these papers now because I know how hard and
                            steadily you are thinking about this whole business.</p>

                        <p>Washington, December 19, 1965.</p>
                        <p>1. We have established the American position with regard to Viet Nam and
                            have made known our position through all possible channels, public and
                            private. The result has been a firm and repeated negative from Hanoi and
                            Peiping.</p>
                        <p>2. We see no serious possibility of immediate diplomatic progress of a
                            public nature unless we are prepared to change the conditions under
                            which public diplomatic action could be undertaken. The principal change
                            of condition available to us would be a pause in the bombing.</p>
                        <pb n="671" xml:id="pg_671" facs="0703"/>
                        <p>3. We have reexamined the question of a formal consideration of Viet Nam
                            by the United Nations Security Council or General Assembly. I have
                            discussed this today with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>. We both believe that the results would be
                            negative. There would not be general and strong support, in the votes
                            cast, for the United States position, and there is a high probability
                            that a majority in the Security Council or in the Assembly would call
                            for a unilateral termination of the bombing by the United States. We
                            believe that the Soviets would bitterly resist any constructive action
                            by the United Nations and would veto any resolution in the Security
                            Council acceptable to us. The point remains that a bitter debate in the
                            United Nations would further freeze the Soviet public position and
                            reduce their options for the future.</p>
                        <p>4. Private diplomacy. I do believe we should continue our discussions
                            with the Soviet Union, Hungary, Yugoslavia and others to make sure that
                            at least the Eastern European Communists fully understand our position
                            and understand that Hanoi's insistence upon their four points (amounting
                            to victory in South Viet Nam) is the central obstacle to peace. I am
                            attaching a copy of a memorandum of conversation between Mr. Zinchuk of
                            the Soviet Embassy and <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William
                                Bundy</persName> which you will find of interest.<note n="5" xml:id="d236fn5">Dated December 16, not printed. A copy is in
                                Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27 VIET <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>.</note>
                            From this memorandum it appears that Hanoi's attitude toward a pause
                            would be negative, but that the Soviets themselves would be much
                            interested in one.</p>
                        <p>5. I believe that we should send a new circular on Viet Nam to all of our
                            Missions abroad giving them an up-to-date recapitulation of peace
                            efforts and our understanding of the present position of Hanoi, as a
                            basis for full discussion of the problem with other governments.</p>
                        <p>6. The Vice President, after attending the Philippine inauguration,
                            should visit Korea and Japan and make a special effort in Japan to
                            explain the Viet Nam question.</p>
                        <p>7. I should think, also, that Averell Harriman might take a trip after
                            the Christmas holidays and combine interest in Viet Nam with a number of
                            other matters, visiting, for example, Paris, the North African Arab
                            countries, Saudi Arabia and Iran. There are a number of other questions
                            which he could usefully take up in a number of these capitals. While in
                            Paris he could get a full report from Chauvel's trip to Hanoi and
                                Peiping.<note n="6" xml:id="d236fn6">Reference is to French diplomat
                                Jean Michel Henri Chauvel's visit to Hanoi and Peking. No record of
                                Harriman receiving a briefing on the trip while in Paris has been
                                found.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>8. The above proposals are rather modest. The central point is, however,
                            that diplomacy cannot produce miracles if Hanoi remains determined to
                            seize South Viet Nam. I have no doubt that this remains <pb n="672" xml:id="pg_672" facs="0704"/>their objective. The reason they do not
                            come to a conference table is that they know that we would not agree to
                            the attainment of their objective at such a conference. What is true of
                            Hanoi is even more true of Peiping. In this instance diplomacy is
                            working within the limitations imposed by Hanoi's objectives in South
                            Viet Nam, which are still in fundamental conflict with our own, and
                            Hanoi's continuing hope that they can somehow succeed on the
                            battlefield.</p>

                        <p>Part I—General</p>
                        <p>1. In accordance with reference, commencing 0300 this morning I discussed
                            thoroughly with Lodge and Westmoreland subject President outlined to me
                            last Friday evening.<note n="3" xml:id="d237fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> met with the
                                President from 5:50 to 6:47 p.m. on December 17. (Ibid., President's
                                Daily Diary) No other record of this meeting has been found.</note>
                            I covered the following salient points:</p>
                        <p>A. The international and domestic pressures on the administration to
                            undertake this action.</p>
                        <p>B. The desire to bolster our position both at home and abroad by
                            silencing, or at least disarming, critics of our policy in order that we
                            may proceed with solid backing to achieve US objectives in SE Asia.</p>
                        <p>C. The fact that, for military and other reasons, I had recommended that
                            this course of action not be adopted. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> agree unanimously with the foregoing
                            recommendation.</p>
                        <p>D. That, if this course of action were adopted, I believed the following
                            safeguards, as a minimum, were needed: (1) no public announcement of the
                            fact; (2) continue as flying conditions permit photographic, <pb n="673" xml:id="pg_673" facs="0705"/>visual and other reconnaissance over
                            the DRV; (3) continue and possibly increase air reconnaissance, air
                            strikes and armed recce against infiltration routes through Laos; (4)
                            continue and possibly increase ground and air operations in South
                            Vietnam; and (5) continue our military buildup in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>E. That the President had authorized me to consult with General <persName corresp="#p_GLGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName> regarding this matter in
                            order further to analyze and evaluate the problem and to inform him,
                            through <persName corresp="#p_GLGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName>, of any
                            “alarming or overly-dangerous aspects”.</p>
                        <p>F. That, in evaluating the problem, we should consider this course of
                            action could be followed throughout the period Christmas Eve through Tet
                            (21-22-23 Jan '66) unless <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> actions
                            led us to resume pressures on <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. Upon conclusion of our discussion we agreed that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> would prepare separate comments.
                            The remainder of this report is arranged accordingly.</p>
                        <p>Part II—Views of General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. We can identify no military advantage to be derived from this course
                            of action except the faint chance that US objectives in <gloss target="#t_SE1">SE</gloss> Asia might be achieved without prolonged
                            armed conflict. In this connection, we note that advocates of this
                            course of action consider chances of this action bringing the Hanoi
                            regime to the conference table are so remote as to be negligible.</p>
                        <p>2. In theory advantages could accrue if conditions/safeguards could be
                            established on a practical basis. But it is a fact of life that the
                            covert nature of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> operations makes it virtually
                            impossible to determine on a day-to-day basis the extent of infiltration
                            of men and equipment. We could therefore find ourselves in a position of
                            ceasing to apply our primary instrument of pressure on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> regime without adequate means of
                            proving or determining the extent of continued <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> aggression. Reconnaissance aircraft are reasonably
                            effective in good weather in detecting movement along well established
                            routes. However, we have limited capabilities of determining movement at
                            night or in foul weather. The extent of compliance with our demands can
                            be ascertained to a degree by enemy fire on reconnaissance aircraft.
                            However, this action is completely unrelated to the aggression which we
                            are trying to stop.</p>
                        <p>3. We consider it a surety that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            would use a period of relaxed pressure on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and lessened restrictions on movements of men and
                            materiel to repair and improve LOC's, to improve the readiness of AA
                            defenses, to increase security of vital installations, and to step up
                            the movement of men, equipment, and supplies to the south. In summary,
                            we believe that our relative military posture could be weakened
                            substantially.</p>
                        <pb n="674" xml:id="pg_674" facs="0706"/>
                        <p>4. Additionally, we consider that there are important political and
                            psychological detriments inherent in this course of action. These
                            are:</p>
                        <p>A. We could be inhibited from resuming pressure against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> by the force of world opinion, by
                            publicized threats or commitments of aid by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and/or the ChiComs which would raise the specter of
                            intervention by one or both, and by lack of clear evidence on our part
                            that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> are in fact continuing
                            substantial movements of men and materiel to the south.</p>
                        <p>B. Inevitably the nature of our action would leak and concern would be
                            created in the minds of the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> military
                            leadership, which concern would be difficult to dispel. Our actions
                            could be interpreted as a prelude to US unilateral negotiations and as a
                            softening in attitude toward Hanoi while the VC are stepping up their
                            military initiatives and acts of terror.</p>
                        <p>C. It would seem that we would be in a stronger psychological and
                            political position if we had achieved a more solid military posture with
                            respect to troops, airfields, and logistics prior to any consideration
                            of slackening our military efforts. We believe that we have now stopped
                            losing but have not yet started to win. A winning stance would seem to
                            be essential to any successful negotiations. Can we expect Hanoi to
                            negotiate until she has been convinced that she cannot win?</p>
                        <p>5. In briefest terms, the “alarming or overly-dangerous aspects” of this
                            course of action are comprised of the following:</p>
                        <p>A. Finding ourselves inhibited from resuming pressure against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, despite the need to do so for the
                            protection of our forces and to prove to the Hanoi regime the costs of
                            aggression.</p>
                        <p>B. Allowing our forces to be tactically endangered because of rapid
                            deployment of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> forces to the
                            south.</p>
                        <p>C. Encountering increased risks of further confrontation with the ChiComs
                            or Soviets should resumption of pressure against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> be required.</p>
                        <p>D. Risking misinterpretation of our actions by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> leadership.</p>
                        <p>6. In consonance with the foregoing, we recommend against adoption of
                            this course of action for the reasons set forth, which we believe
                            cogent. However, if this course of action is nevertheless adopted, we
                            recommend that the safeguards set forth in sub-paragraph 1D of Part I be
                            established as a minimum.</p>
                        <p>7. We feel that there is merit in cessation of our bombing campaign in
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> on Christmas day, on New Year's
                            eve and New Year's day, and during the three day period of Tet (21, 22
                            and 23 January). During these days reconnaissance aircraft should be
                            evident in the skies over the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> for
                            the purposes of distributing leaflets as part of a psywar campaign <pb n="675" xml:id="pg_675" facs="0707"/>and to demonstrate that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>/US are calling the shots in this
                            war.</p>
                        <p>Part III—Views of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> Herewith my comments on the proposal for an
                            indefinite suspension of bombing, said suspension to begin at Christmas,
                            bombing to be resumed if infiltration from North Viet-Nam is continued,
                            the purpose being to bring North Viet-Nam to the negotiating table.</p>

                        <p>1. I recognize current political realities and the appeal of this idea to
                            some persons. Yet it rests on fundamental misconceptions as to the real
                            nature of Communist governments and would, if carried out, tend to
                            defeat its own purpose.</p>
                        <p>2. Actually a proposal like this will lead the Communists away from
                            negotiations because it will be interpreted by them as being a sign of
                            weakness and indecision. The proposal assumes that the Communists are
                            like us; that they are in effect like misguided Americans who will
                            reciprocate our kindness and our toleration and our sense of fair play
                            when every experience we have had with Communists, whether at the United
                            Nations or Panmunjom, or in Berlin, shows that the reverse is the case
                            and that they can only be induced to follow a certain course by the
                            application of pressure. They are in truth indifferent to human life and
                            are always probing.</p>
                        <p>3. The way to end this war, therefore, is by the application of U.S.
                            force. If talks should ever begin, they must be held to the
                            accompaniment of the application of force or else they are foredoomed to
                            failure. We should not forget that there were more people killed after
                            the peace talks began at Panmunjom than there were before because we
                            overlooked this simple principle. I believe the proposition, therefore,
                            as stated, looks at the Vietnamese situation through the wrong end of
                            the telescope, and that it would achieve the opposite result from what
                            its sponsors intend.</p>
                        <p>4. The fact is that our bombing of North Viet-Nam must be equated with
                            the Viet Cong aggression against South Viet-Nam—and not merely the
                            infiltration aspect. Indefinite cessation of bombing without cessation
                            of the Viet Cong aggression would leave the Viet Cong free to devastate
                            the south with impunity while we tie our hands down in the north.</p>
                        <p>5. Cessation of bombings should be equated with withdrawal of North
                            Vietnamese units through international checkpoints to the north;
                            unimpeded access of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to any part
                            of its territory; a significant reduction of incidents; cessation of
                            infiltration of men and materiel; and an agreement that at any talks
                            which would be held the matter of an inspection system and enforcement
                            devices would be the first item on the agenda.</p>
                        <p>6. There is, to be sure, in the proposal no mechanism wherewith to check
                            infiltration or withdrawal of North Vietnamese units. Suppose we <pb n="676" xml:id="pg_676" facs="0708"/>started bombing again on the
                            basis of intelligence information, the source of which we could not
                            reveal. Would not the uproar among the wishful thinkers be even greater
                            than it is now? Would we not be in an interminable wrangle over
                            resumption?</p>
                        <p>7. As far as the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is concerned, the
                                <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> talks had a
                            devastating effect here because the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            thought for a moment that we were negotiating their very life behind
                            their backs. It threatened to destroy much that had been built up here
                            in the way of confidence and good feeling. An open ended, unequated
                            suspension of bombing could, I think, either bring about the collapse of
                            the government or its determined opposition. It would also collapse
                            morale in the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>8. Finally, it would destroy the very big political accomplishments which
                            the President's policies have brought about. Let us not forget that the
                            strongest thing in Viet-Nam is not seeing the B-52s overhead; it is not
                            having the Seventh Fleet come circling in; it is not the huge
                            expenditures by <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>. It is faith in
                            American steadfastness. It was when the Vietnamese saw the American
                            soldier on the ground that they were persuaded that we were committed,
                            and said to themselves: “If the Americans can commit themselves, then I
                            can commit myself.” It is on this belief that the government, which no
                            one thought would last more than three weeks, has lasted as long as it
                            has. This was a big political accomplishment before our troops even
                            fired a shot. When they distinguished themselves in battle, of course,
                            it added to the confidence.</p>
                        <p>9. An open ended, unequated cessation of bombing would destroy the
                            tremendous political accomplishments President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> has wrought, and for which
                            American fighting men sacrifice themselves—some of them, their lives.
                            This is a very serious thing to do without a real chance that the
                            objective of peace will be achieved—a chance which I do not see.</p>
                        <p>10. A variant of the main proposal is that the bombing be stopped for
                            Christmas, New Year, Tet and during bad weather. It might be possible to
                            do these things without a public announcement and not do too much harm,
                            although I believe we should tell the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, as they would certainly find out about it.</p>
                        <p>11. I recognize the President's very grave problem.He is the one who must
                            cope with the Senate and with public opinion. Yet he deserves to know
                            what his representatives on the spot in their heart of hearts think of
                            the consequences. I shall, of course, loyally support his decisions.</p>

                        <p>President: I would say: “We and our allies will take no military
                            initiative except in self defense on Christmas Day”. We'd say this as
                            soon as it is cleared. What about New Years and Tet?</p>
                        <p>Rusk: Much more comprehensive operation on Tet.</p>

                        <p>Bundy: We ought to examine the question of a continuous pause, the only
                            kind useful with the Soviets. Benevolent, but not internationally
                            significant unless we have a clear specific period. We could get a major

                        <p>Rusk: I'm not giving up the possibility for a pause. But we ought to talk
                            to the Hungarians and Russians.</p>
                        <p>Bundy: I don't see where it leads us.</p>
                        <p>Rusk: Go for one day at Christmas. Defer further action until we talk to
                            the Hungarians and Russians.</p>
                        <p>Bundy: Do you think they will tell us anything they haven't before?</p>
                        <p>Rusk: If <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> had one of his

                            might pick up something.</p>
                        <p>Does the President think a pause is possible while Congress is in
                            session?</p>
                        <p>President: Yes, but don't look with favor on it—it's more a sign of
                            weakness than anything else. All we'll get is distrust from our allies,
                            despair from the troops, and disgruntled generals.</p>
                        <p>Hanoi and Peking tell us we're weak—won't do anything if we pause. If we
                            suffer a severe reverse as a result of this, we'd never explain it. It's
                            not difficult to explain why we fight when we are attacked every hour.
                            But when commanders say it's suicide, and we do it anyway, there's no
                            explanation.</p>

                        <p>I want more evidence from the Russians before I override <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> et al.</p>

                        <p>Bundy: I don't find the cables persuasive, but I understand your
                            position. I think the cables miss the point—as a commitment to do
                            nothing for a month. We can stop bombing, not say anything, and resume
                            when we choose.</p>
                        <p>President: Would pressure mount to tell the press?</p>
                        <p>Bundy: Yes, it would be brutal. But Christmas and [Congress' recess?]
                            seem a logical time to pause.</p>

                        <p>President: 1. Once we take our step, we could have serious problems to
                            resume bombing.</p>
                        <p>2. The danger is that it conveys the wrong signal—and I think it
                            does.</p>
                        <p>If men we rely on to fight for us feel as strongly as they do—as Lodge
                            does—I'd hate to have them at odds with us.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: We've had a good
                            discussion. But we need political initiative. But we have had the best
                            discussion ever on this subject.</p>
                        <p>President: Yes, but this is not the political initiative we want now.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Question: Should we
                            take out <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> in Haiphong? I say we need
                            to—but not at this time.</p>
                        <p>We need to go into Hanoi circle—30 miles—and take three bridges in this
                            circle. Let the field commanders pick up 4 out of 7 possible targets.
                            This would begin Thursday noon our time. The probability is that it will
                            be after Christmas due to weather. Those targets are only a few miles
                            inside the circle.</p>
                        <p>Bundy: There is a Cambodian problem as a result of giving commanders the
                            right to defend their troops.</p>
                        <p>The leak came from Saigon. The first story came from Keyes Beech—and
                            Times confirmed it.</p>
                        <p>President: <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> was very
                            laudatory about Keyes Beech. I think our Congressmen go out and are very
                            frank—and to show how smart they are.</p>
                        <p>I had the Governors out to my Ranch—and I told Reed of Maine he was the
                            leak to Charles Mohr of the Times.</p>

                        <p>The US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> air strikes to date fall far
                            short of crippling the North Vietnamese economy. But the sustained and
                            increasing rate of attrition is causing the economy to develop a
                            noticeable limp. Even with increasing assistance from other Communist
                            countries, the adverse impact is now becoming more apparent in the
                            economically important areas of the country. The extension of
                            interdiction measures to lines of communication joining important
                            industrial centers is compounding already aggravated distribution
                            problems. The regime is apparently making increased use of ocean
                            transport to provide relief to overland distribution channels. Hanoi now
                            admits publicly to a substantial upheaval of production plans in many
                            industrial plants. Import and export programs are in disarray. The
                            planned program under the First Five Year Plan (1961-1965) has undergone
                            substantial rearrangement. A recent report indicates, moreover, that
                            implementation of the Second Five Year Plan scheduled to begin in
                            January 1966 has been postponed. The increasing rate of deterioration of
                            some important sectors of the economy still has not greatly reduced
                            total economic activity. The primary strains continue to be in
                            distribution, allocation of manpower, and management resources. In the
                            face of great difficulties, however, priority traffic continues to move.
                            The air strikes have not yet halted, or even reduced, priority
                            short-term support by the economy to North Vietnam's military efforts,
                            but this support has been maintained only by transferring men and
                            materials away from long-term activities and projects.</p>
                        <p>The air strikes against overland transport facilities and routes in North
                            Vietnam have hampered the movement of personnel, equipment, and supplies
                            but have not significantly reduced the North Vietnamese capability to
                            provide and increase their logistic support for the Communist forces in
                            Laos and South Vietnam. The capacity of specific transport routes has
                            been reduced by the bombings, but on most routes it is still in excess
                            of the present level of logistic movements. The North Vietnamese have
                            demonstrated a remarkable capability to keep supplies moving in spite of
                            the air attacks. The various improvements and improvisations <pb n="681" xml:id="pg_681" facs="0713"/>instituted by the Communists have
                            increased their capability to move men and supplies into Laos and South
                            Vietnam during the present dry season. Even with an intensification of
                            air attacks it is doubtful that the capacity of the overland transport
                            system can be reduced below the level required to provide logistic
                            support at the existing scale of combat in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The ability of the North Vietnamese to keep the industrial economy moving
                            on a makeshift basis, to maintain priority transportation movements, and
                            to provide the support necessary for military operations, is in large
                            part a result of increasing assistance from other Communist countries.
                            This assistance has taken several forms: the assignment of elements of
                            two Chinese railroad engineer divisions to help keep transportation
                            lines open; large increases in shipments of motor trucks; the provision
                            of structural steels and prefabricated shapes for bridge repair and
                            reconstruction; and the assignment of technical and industrial advisers
                            from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and European Satellite
                            countries. The amount and scope of this support continued to grow in
                            recent weeks.</p>
                        <p>Direct losses caused by damage to economic facilities and equipment are
                            now estimated at almost $23 million and measurable indirect losses
                            amount to almost $9 million. The cost of permanent reconstruction of
                            rail/highway bridges would be more than $10 million, and the replacement
                            or repair of destroyed or damaged transport equipment would cost an
                            additonal $5.4 million. The cost of temporary repairs to bridges would
                            be more than $1 million. Reconstruction of the damaged electric power
                            plants, the petroleum storage facilities, and the Nam Dinh textile mill
                            would cost about $6 million. The loss of foreign exchange earnings
                            totals at least $5.2 million. The growing losses from lower production
                            throughout the economy can be quantified only in agriculture where
                            losses in the fall rice crop may have amounted to about $3.5 million.
                            The measurable costs of reconstruction, replacement, and repair of
                            damaged facilities, if attempted, would represent more than 20 per cent
                            of total gross annual investment in industry. The additional cost which
                            North Vietnam is incurring for temporary expedients to compensate in
                            part for the damaged facilities cannot be quantified at this time.</p>
                        <p>The most severe disruptions of economic activity in North Vietnam have
                            been in the southern part of the country where the transportation system
                            has been heavily bombed and electric power stations have been destroyed.
                            Industry in this part of the country normally accounts for only about 20
                            per cent of total gross industrial output, however, and consists mainly
                            of textile production, food processing, lumber and paper production,
                            chromite mining, and processing of crude phosphate fertilizers.
                            Continued shortages of manpower and equipment in the areas directly
                            affected by bombing have hampered reconstruction efforts and created
                            severe hardships for local populations, but the primarily rural <pb n="682" xml:id="pg_682" facs="0714"/>nature of these regions has
                            permitted continued functioning of the subsistence economy.</p>
                        <p>The disruptions caused by bombing are now being felt in the more
                            economically important areas of the country. The difficulties in
                            maintaining production in the face of insoluble management problems and
                            shortages of skilled manpower have been compounded by the disruption of
                            the distribution system. In November, for the first time, the
                            transportation system connecting North Vietnam's major industrial areas
                            was attacked. Through rail service between Hanoi and Nam Dinh was
                            interdicted by the destruction of the Phu Ly railroad bridge on the
                            Hanoi-Vinh line. However, rail traffic is apparently still moving on
                            stretches of this rail line between interdicted points. A combination
                            railroad and highway bridge serving the Hanoi-Haiphong railroad line and
                            Route 5 was also attacked. The damage to this bridge was light and by
                            undertaking priority repair measures rail service on the line was
                            quickly restored. Nevertheless, these air strikes undoubtedly further
                            disrupted the flow of exports, imports, and goods for domestic use.
                            According to the regional press, distribution problems resulting from
                            damage to the transportation system have “turned upside down” production
                            plans in many enterprises in Haiphong, where some plants have been
                            substituting inferior materials for unavailable regular supplies.
                            Essential materials and equipment can still be delivered to Haiphong by
                            sea, however, and until 1 December other industrial centers could still
                            receive supplies from China via the Hanoi-Dong Dang rail line where
                            previous bomb damage was quickly repaired. On 1 December, however, the
                            Cao Nung railroad bridge on the Hanoi-Dong Dang line was again attacked
                            and several spans were dropped. Several weeks will be required to make
                            temporary repairs to the bridge. In the meantime some cargo probably
                            will be moved across the river by fording, and some can be moved by road
                            on alternate routes such as 13B, which has not been attacked, and 1A and
                            18, where enough time has probably elapsed for bomb damage to have been
                            repaired. Some freight normally shipped by rail between China and North
                            Vietnam probably was already being transferred to sea transportation
                            before the 1 December strike. This action was taken so that high
                            priority items such as military supplies could be handled more easily by
                            rail. Despite the increasing disruptions, work on major economic
                            development projects of the First Five Year Plan (1961-1965) is
                            continuing and several new projects have been undertaken in the past few
                            months.</p>
                        <p>The Hanoi-Lao Cai railroad line reportedly was opened for through traffic
                            early in December even though there were a series of strikes against
                            this line at the end of November. Although photography is not available
                            to assess the results of these strikes, damage must have been slight or
                            negligible for the line to be opened so quickly. If the line remains <pb n="683" xml:id="pg_683" facs="0715"/>open we would expect to see a
                            resumption of apatite shipments moving to Haiphong for export.
                            Practically no Chinese transit traffic to and from Yunnan has moved
                            through North Vietnam since July. There have been no indications,
                            however, that either Yunnan or the rest of China has suffered serious
                            shortages because of the loss of transit service through North Vietnam.
                            Truck transport within China apparently is being used to replace this
                            transit service. Transportation in the southern part of North Vietnam
                            continues to be complicated by air attacks. In spite of heavy damage to
                            bridges, substantial amounts of both economic and military traffic
                            continue to be hauled by motor truck and on a makeshift rail line south
                            of Vinh. The movement of all types of traffic on the waterways also
                            appears heavy. Supplies are again being moved from North Vietnam on
                            Route 15 to Routes 12 and 23 in Laos through Mu Gia Pass and on a newly
                            reported truckable by-pass around the Pass. The transport system of
                            North Vietnam appears to be carrying as much tonnage during 1965 as it
                            did during 1964. The interruption on certain rail lines, however, will
                            result in a considerably lower performance in terms of
                            ton-kilometers.</p>
                        <p>There have been no recent strikes or restrikes against bulk oil storage
                            facilities or electric power plant in North Vietnam.<note n="2" xml:id="d239fn2">This assessment does not take into count the 15

                            problems in petroleum distribution and storage, but there is no over-all

                            have been reduced in capacity by about 17 per cent. No action has been
                            taken to rehabilitate any of these bombed POL storage facilities.
                            However, recent photography discloses the existence of seven additional

                            miles north of Hanoi. These sites include a total of about 300
                            semi-buried tanks (each about the size of an airport refueling tank
                            truck), but represent total storage of only 2,200 tons. The size of the
                            tanks and the number of sites suggest that this storage is intended to
                            disperse petroleum supplies rather than provide for significant
                            reserves. The reduction of total generating capacity by about 14 per
                            cent continues to cause relatively minor curtailment of mining and
                            industrial operations and loss of power for irrigation systems. A
                            continuing study of all available source material has disclosed no
                            recent information concerning bomb damage to machine building plants or
                            to non-food light industrial plants. Priorities and alternate means of
                            communication have been established in the telecommunications
                            industry.</p>
                        <p>There is no evidence that the air strikes have further aggravated the
                            tight food situation in North Vietnam. The harvest promises at best to
                            be <pb n="684" xml:id="pg_684" facs="0716"/>mediocre, and in light of
                            increased distribution problems because of the war the tight food
                            situation will continue. Labor shortages in the agricultural
                            cooperatives continue to be aggravated because of the air strikes.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">North Vietnamese Political and Public
                            Reactions</p>
                        <p>There continues to be no indication of any significant decline in North
                            Vietnamese morale. Regime propaganda continued to stress the resolve and
                            ability of the Vietnamese to ultimately defeat the “US aggressors.”
                            Hanoi paid particular attention to the Vietnam protest movements in the
                            US and cited them as an indication that the cost of the war in men and
                            materiel could ultimately undermine American morale and force a change
                            in the US policy toward the war. This theme was generally coupled in
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> propaganda with claims of
                            world-wide support for the Vietnamese Communists and references to the
                            recent Viet Cong “victories” over US and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces. Although both these themes were designed to
                            sustain the fighting will of the insurgents as well as the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> populace, they probably accurately
                            reflect current Hanoi estimates of the situation.</p>
                        <p>The disruptive effect of the air strikes on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>'s economy was reflected in the regime's propaganda.
                            This recently took the form of efforts to spur the populace on to
                            greater patriotic endeavors in order to meet and overcome the
                            difficulties caused by the strikes. A party daily editorial on 18
                            November in taking note of the disruption in transportation and
                            communications called upon persons to pay more attention to these two
                            areas and to be “determined, urgent and flexible in meeting war
                            circumstances.” In addition, other articles stressing the necessity of
                            increasing food production and distribution as well as improving public
                            order “for the sake of the anti-US and national salvation cause” were
                            highlighted in <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> propaganda.</p>
                        <p>The growing disruption caused by the bombings also appeared to be the
                            motive behind Hanoi's dispatching its high-ranking economic expert,
                            politburo member Le Thanh Nghi, to Moscow, Peiping and Pyongyang in late
                            November. Nghi's trip—his second in less than six months—is probably an
                            indication that the bombings have affected the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> economy to such an extent that consultations on
                            additional economic aid from the Bloc are now needed. Through Nghi's
                            trip Hanoi may be seeking additional supplies of capital equipment for
                            bomb damage repair and perhaps even food, clothing and other
                            necessities. The North Vietnamese may also believe it essential to get
                            some long range commitment on future Bloc assistance in the event that
                            US bombings destroy most of North Vietnam's industry and transportation
                            system.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Effects on Military Targets</p>
                        <p>There has been no recent, appreciable change in the intensity of air
                            operations against North Vietnam. The air effort continued to place <pb n="685" xml:id="pg_685" facs="0717"/>emphasis on the armed
                            reconnaissance program, aimed at inhibiting movement over the lines of
                            communication and restriking and neutralizing previously attacked
                            targets. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>-designated targets
                            recently attacked have been predominantly rail and highway bridges north
                            of 20 degrees. As the air strikes concentrated on targets north and east
                            of Hanoi, the requirement to neutralize SA-2 sites accelerated. Armed
                            reconnaissance aircraft have continued to attack SA-2 sites. These
                            attacks produced few dramatic results, but possibly caused a more
                            frequent displacement of SA-2 firing elements which could result in
                            reduced operating efficiency. Since no major effort has been expended
                            against barracks, supply and ammunition depots and <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> storage areas, related national
                            capacities have not been appreciably altered. The North Vietnamese are
                            continuing their efforts to disperse such vulnerable elements of their
                            infrastructure as barracks, supply and ammunition depots. Recent
                            evidence points to a new program of dispersing <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> stocks to locales north of Hanoi within the <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> protected area.</p>
                        <p>While there are periodic indications of specific, tactical, reactions to
                            the air offensive, the most overriding reaction is the emergence of
                            strategic indicators which suggest Hanoi's willingness to persevere
                            indefinitely. These latter indicators include dispersal of industry,
                            partial mobilization, intensified coordination with other Communist
                            countries to obtain increased military aid, and long range construction
                            programs aimed at improving military air facilities. In a tactical
                            sense, the North Vietnamese have recognized the effectiveness of US
                            measures to counter the SA-2 threat. In this regard, they have taken
                            action to degrade our capability to detect and counter FAN SONG (SA-2
                            guidance radar) operations by compressing the operating time of this
                            vital guidance system.</p>
                        <p>While the air strikes against logistics facilities and sensitive lines of
                            communications are causing major distribution problems, these operations
                            have not significantly reduced the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            capability to continue to support the Communist forces in Laos and South

                        <p>On the plane back to Washington from the Ranch on Friday afternoon,
                            December 10, I discussed with Bob McNamara the potential for new flags
                            and additional military contributions to Viet-Nam. I also reviewed the
                            problem with Dean Rusk on my return. It was agreed that both Secretaries
                            would discuss the possibility of a Greek and Turkish military
                            contribution at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Meeting in
                                Paris,<note n="2" xml:id="d240fn2">The Ministerial Session of the

                            encouraged to increase their material assistance. As you know, Dean made
                            a vigorous speech at <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, urging that
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Members make a greater effort
                            in support of South Vietnam. Dean's initiative will be followed up with

                            Korean negotiations are already under way.</p>
                        <p>I talked with the Australian Ambassador here last week and our Embassy in
                            Canberra has been in touch with the Australian Government. Bob Menzies
                            plans to undertake to increase the Australian military contribution but
                            he believes that any action should be an Australian self-starter rather
                            than under pressure from the U.S. I told the Ambassador of your personal
                            interest and he agreed to pass the message on to <persName corresp="#p_MSRG1">Menzies</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The manner in which Thailand can be most helpful is being reviewed. As
                            you know, the Thais are giving us the fullest possible cooperation in
                            the use of their facilities.</p>
                        <p>In Latin America, Brazil is the first case. Ambassador Gordon explained
                            to President Castelo Branco that while the program loan decision was not
                            contingent on a Brazilian military contribution in Viet-Nam, it was
                            expected that Castelo Branco would make every effort to help in Vietnam.
                            In a long and serious conversation with Castelo on December 15th he
                            explained our position in great detail. Castelo has promised to <pb n="687" xml:id="pg_687" facs="0719"/>give the matter his prayerful
                            consideration. He pointed out that under the Brazilian Constitution
                            Congressional approval is required before troops can be sent abroad and
                            the Brazilian Congress does not reconvene until March. Gordon and our
                            military attache, General Walters, will follow this up closely and,
                            although keenly aware of the political problems Castelo faces, they are
                            hopeful that a Brazilian contribution in some form can be worked
                            out.</p>
                        <p>We will take up with each of the other Latin American countries on a case
                            by case basis the kind of contribution each might be induced to
                            make.</p>
                        <p>As far as Africa is concerned, all hands agree that there is no
                            possibility of a contribution from any African country particularly at
                            this time with the preoccupation over Southern Rhodesia.</p>
                        <p>On Iran, Dean feels that a military contribution might stir up the
                            Russians and that it would be better to let sleeping dogs lie. We are,
                            however, going after Iran for a military-medical team on a large enough
                            scale to take care of one Province. The senior <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> Public Health officer in Saigon, General Humphreys,
                            will go to Iran to work out the details.</p>
                        <p>I will continue to keep in close touch with the Regional Bureaus to see
                            that the maximum effort is made to get more flags and more assistance,
                            military or material, as well as to try to get more publicity on what is
                            being done.</p>
                        <p>Dean thinks that it might be useful for me to make a trip in January to
                            certain European countries, possibly including Yugoslavia. Based on my
                            talks with Tito last summer, there is a possibility that he might be
                            induced to exert his influence on Moscow to persuade the Soviets to take
                            greater initiative with Hanoi to come to the negotiating table. It might
                            also be useful to stop off in the North African countries and Iran.</p>

                        <p>Hungarian Charge Radvanyi came to the Department at the Secretary's
                            request. The Secretary said that he appreciated <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName>'s coming to the Department just
                            before the Christmas holidays, and expressed interest in whether Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> had developed any
                            postscript to his last talk with the Secretary in New York,<note n="2" xml:id="d241fn2">See <ref target="#d160">Document 160</ref>.</note>
                            at which Charge <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> had been
                            present. He was not inquiring whether <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> had any instructions, although he assumed not.
                            The Secretary had invited Minister <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> to use a little “16th Century Hungarian
                            diplomacy”, and would now be grateful if <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> could ask Minister <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> if there were anything <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> could add to what was said in New York.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he might make two or three comments as background
                            for asking Charge <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> to come
                            to the Department. American newspapers had referred recently to peace
                            feelers. Hanoi had denied these stories, and he knew of no instance in
                            which Hanoi had taken an initiative in this matter. Others, such as U
                            Thant and the Mayor of Florence, had taken such initiatives. All such
                            initiatives were, however, taken by third parties. He had the impression
                            that Hanoi's representatives abroad, and in Hanoi itself, were socially
                            very busy; everyone wanted to see them. When third parties go to see
                            such representatives, they come back with initiatives which evidently
                            they believe important. We are not aware of any initiative taken by
                            Hanoi at its own instance.</p>
                        <p>His second point, the Secretary said, was that many initiatives had been
                            taken by a large number of people towards unconditional discussions. The
                            initiatives known publicly were only a fraction of those taken
                            privately. Thus far no initiative had produced any results. The key
                            question continued to be Point 3 of Hanoi's 4 points, namely acceptance
                            of the program of the Liberation Front for South Viet-Nam. The third
                            point was <pb n="689" xml:id="pg_689" facs="0721"/>what the shooting was
                            all about. Hanoi wanted it, and they could not have it by force.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would like to review for Minister <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> the things said publicly on our
                            side with respect to peace in Southeast Asia:</p>
                        <p>1. We have said that the Geneva Agreements of 1954 and 1962 are a basis
                            for peace in Southeast Asia;</p>
                        <p>2. We would welcome a conference on Southeast Asia, or on any part of
                            it;</p>
                        <p>3. We would welcome negotiations without preconditions (using the terms
                            of the 17 nations);</p>
                        <p>4. We would welcome unconditional discussions (using the President's
                            term);</p>
                        <p>5. The question of cessation of hostilities can be taken first and then
                            made the grounds for a conference, or, if anyone preferred, made the
                            subject of preliminary discussions;</p>
                        <p>6. Hanoi's 4 points can be discussed at a conference, provided that those
                            points others have in mind are also discussed;</p>
                        <p>7. We do not wish to maintain any bases in Southeast Asia;</p>
                        <p>8. We do not wish to retain any military forces in South Viet-Nam;</p>
                        <p>9. There could be free elections in South Viet-Nam;</p>
                        <p>10. The question of reunification is to be subject to the free choice of
                            the people of Viet-Nam, and not to be imposed by force;</p>
                        <p>11. We would much prefer to use our resources, both economic and social,
                            in developing Southeast Asia. North Viet-Nam was free to join in a
                            regional program in which we were prepared to invest $1 billion;</p>
                        <p>12. We could stop bombing as a step towards peace, as Minister <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> knows we have said. But tell us
                            what would happen if we stopped bombing. Would the bombing in South
                            Viet-Nam stop? Would they come to the conference table? Would the 325th
                            Division go home?</p>
                        <p>When one put it all together, the Secretary continued, the basket was
                            filled from our side. The only thing not in the basket was South
                            Viet-Nam. The only thing we could add was “Take South Viet-Nam.” That we
                            could not say. Perhaps Hanoi did not believe some of these things we
                            have said. The Secretary recalled he had said he would go to Geneva
                            tomorrow afternoon. The way for Hanoi to find out, added the Secretary,
                            is to find out. We can get there faster than they can. Perhaps they do
                            not believe what we say about bases in Southeast Asia. But they can find
                            out.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Rusk told Charge <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName>
                            that he just wanted <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> to
                            tell Minister <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> that he had
                            thought often of their talk in New York. The Secretary wondered if there
                            was anything else that Minister <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> wished to pass on.</p>
                        <p>Charge <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> asked the Secretary
                            to clarify what had been reported in the papers about a 30-hour
                            Christmas lull in Viet-Nam. The <pb n="690" xml:id="pg_690" facs="0722"/>Secretary said that the 12-hour ceasefire proposed by the Viet-Cong
                            was not very significant to us from the religious point of view since
                            Christmas Eve and Christmas Day were a single unit. We were not
                            particularly attracted to the Viet Cong idea that we take 12 hours to
                            trim our Christmas trees and then watch out for the plastic bombs. So we
                            had said we would treat the period as a whole, for 30 hours.</p>
                        <p>He owed it to Minister <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName>, the
                            Secretary continued, to point out that this was an indication of some
                            flexibility on our part. We did not expect the 30-hour period to be a
                            political initiative, as the period was too short. It was indicative of
                            some flexibility, just a tiny indication. If he were advising Charge
                                <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> how to report the
                            importance of the 30-hour lull, he would not stress its political
                            importance too much. The US had decided, so far as the Viet Cong would
                            allow it, to introduce this lull at Christmas not only in South Viet-Nam
                            but also as far as bombing of the North was concerned. The opportunity
                            might arise again, at the time of the Vietnamese New Year. If the other
                            side were responsive, we might find a way to move towards peace by steps
                            like these.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stressed that no commitments could be made at this time
                            with respect to the future, but he did mention the fact that New Year
                            was coming, with its Viet-Nam holiday also, and this fact might offer an
                            occasion to do something like the Christmas ceasefire again. No decision
                            could be made on the future yet, however, as it depended partly on what
                            happened at Christmas.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted that he would also appreciate it if Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> had any comments
                            regarding the Hanoi and Peiping statements of the last two weeks which
                            had been of some interest.<note n="3" xml:id="d241fn3">Apparent
                                reference to a commentary in Hanoi's official paper, Nhan Dan, on
                                December 9, broadcast by Hanoi in English; an interview of <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> by British journalist
                                Felix Greene, broadcast by Hanoi on December 8; and a broadcast by

                                Vietnam) On December 20, speaking at a reception in Peking in honor
                                of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation
                                Front, <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> accused the
                                Soviet Union of “sowing discord in an attempt to undermine the
                                Vietnamese people's unity against U.S. aggression and the unity of
                                the Vietnamese and Chinese people against U.S. imperialism.” (Peter
                                Cheng, <hi rend="italic">A Chronology of the People's Republic of
                                    China</hi> (Totowa, NJ, 1972), p. 212)</note> The Secretary
                            would protect Minister Peter's discretion. Peiping had chided Moscow,
                            which made it sound as if Peiping knew that the subject of peace moves
                            had been discussed in Hanoi. Broadly speaking, the Secretary continued,
                            what he was asking was that in the light of the very interesting
                            conversation the Secretary had had in New York with Minister Peter, was
                            there anything else that Minister Peter could add privately?</p>
                        <p>At this point Charge <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName>
                            remarked that although the Secretary could count on absolute discretion
                            from the Hungarian side, there had already been press inquiries about
                            the subject of the Charge's call on <pb n="691" xml:id="pg_691" facs="0723"/>the Secretary. It was agreed by the Secretary and by
                            Charge <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> that the press
                            would be informed only that the present meeting was a continuation of
                            the Secretary's previous discussion with Minister <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> in New York, on general questions
                            and bilateral questions. Charge <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> noted that as to bilateral questions, he
                            believed the present atmosphere was less of an obstacle for bilateral
                            US-Hungarian talks in Budapest then it was in Washington. The Secretary
                            observed that the reverse was true in terms of US-Soviet relations. The
                            Secretary indicated that after the holidays he would be glad to discuss
                            bilateral US-Hungarian affairs at greater length.</p>
                        <p>Charge <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> said that he would
                            inform Budapest immediately of the discussion, and would convey an
                            answer to the Secretary as fast as he received it. The Secretary said he
                            would await any answer with interest, that he would remain in Washington
                            over the Christmas holidays, and that he could be reached at any hour of
                            the day or night through the White House switchboard.</p>

                            prohibiting firing except in self-defense, suspending operations against
                            North Vietnam and North Vietnamese troops in Laos, and halting B-52
                            operations would remain in force. Washington fully expected the Viet
                            Cong to break the truce within a day or so. (Ibid.)</p>

                        <p>Herewith four ideas about Viet Nam, submitted to you at Jack Valenti's
                            suggestion.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. A South Vietnamese Political Party</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Proposal</hi>. That we focus our political energies
                            in Saigon—and seek Korean assistance—in building a widely based South
                            Vietnamese political party.</p>
                        <pb n="693" xml:id="pg_693" facs="0725"/>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Discussion</hi>. The critical missing element in the
                            stabilization of politics in South Viet Nam is an effective political
                            party engaging the major groups which constitute now—and will constitute
                            in the future—an effective majority.</p>
                        <p>We all understand the deep splits in the political and social life of
                            South Viet Nam: Northerners v. Southerners; French trained Catholics v.
                            more indigenous Buddhists; etc. We are doing what we can in Saigon to
                            urge them to come closer together; <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> is considering a representative advisory group; and
                            the most wholesome political fact about South Viet Nam is that the
                            Vietnamese are beginning to talk and worry about what the Communists
                            will do to them if they remain split and peace (or negotiations) breaks
                            out.</p>
                        <p>Focussing right now on a political party may seem like a gimmick. But our
                            experience in Korea over the last five years indicates that it is
                            something more: it may prove the device for crystallizing minimum
                            national unity.</p>
                        <p>I am now convinced, for example, that it was the creation of the
                            government party in Korea that converted Park from a well-meaning
                            soldier into an effective politician and, even, a statesman—laying the
                            base for the true Korean “miracle” now under way.</p>
                        <p>To my certain knowledge, our people were almost as hopeless about Korea
                            in 1961, after the young officers' coup, as they now are about politics
                            in South Viet Nam. The Koreans were about as fragmented, inexperienced,
                            and helpless in making a political life as the Vietnamese have been.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, what we have seen happen in other parts of the world suggests
                            that a widely based national political party is fundamental to stable
                            government in a developing country.</p>
                        <p>The secret of Indian democracy, for example, is not the British-trained
                            civil service: it is the Congress Party, containing representatives of
                            all regions and major social groups. Such parties are the secret of
                            success in Mexico and Tunisia and of the relative stability of Tanzania,
                            Kenya, and Ghana. I believe Castelo Branco is on the right track with
                            his effort to force by law the making of big parties in Brazil.</p>
                        <p>Why is this so?</p>
                        <p>Big national parties force the various regional and special interests to
                            come to compromise and to formulate national programs in order to get
                            elected and enjoy the fruits of victory. They also establish a minimum
                            political base and the minimum political discipline to permit an elected
                            President to govern.</p>
                        <p>The central political weakness in the developing nations is that
                            fragmented political parties and squabbling politicians, representing
                            narrow regional interests, press directly and irresponsibly against the
                            democratically <pb n="694" xml:id="pg_694" facs="0726"/>elected
                            presidents. The presidents are so busy balancing off these pressures
                            they find it hard to act. And that is why military coups happen.</p>
                        <p>What General Soglo said the other day in Dahomey, as he took over, is the
                            epitaph of scores of early experiments in democracy in developing
                            nations:</p>
                        <p>“Considering that after two years, the political authorities demonstrated
                            their inability to lead the country to a better future by struggles for
                            influence harmful to the superior interests of Dahomey; …</p>
                        <p>“Considering that our country is obviously on the eve of a veritable
                            catastrophe whose only victims will be the humble workers in our towns
                            and rural areas;</p>
                        <p>“[We]<note n="2" xml:id="d243fn2">Brackets in the source text.</note>
                            therefore decide in the superior interests of the nation and in order to
                            safeguard our prestige on the international scene to take over power
                            temporarily and endeavor to effect national reconciliation on which
                            alone depends the moral and economic recovery of our dear
                            fatherland.”</p>
                        <p>Can the job be done now in Viet Nam?</p>
                        <p>I don't know. But I do know we should focus our efforts around the task.
                            I do know there are glimmerings of a desire among the Vietnamese to pull
                            together. And I do know they are beginning to understand they will
                            either hang together or hang separately.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, we should enlist the Koreans in the effort. Their experience is
                            the closest parallel to that in South Viet Nam. They, too, began with a
                            mandarin autocrat; then had squabbling civil politicians; then a young
                            officers' coup.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the Koreans have, next to us, the biggest direct political as
                            well as military stake in the future independence and stability of South
                            Viet Nam.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Action</hi>.</p>
                        <p>a. We should approach General Park and suggest that he write directly to
                            General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> explaining fraternally
                            the lessons of his experience in building a stable civil government in
                            South Korea over recent years; the role of the government party in that
                            process; and offering to send to General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> men who will explain in detail how his national
                            political party was organized and how they made the transition in Seoul
                            from military to civil politics.</p>
                        <p>b. That Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and his
                            staff, including the <persName corresp="#p_LEG1">Lansdale</persName>
                            team, focus their efforts on encouraging the government in Saigon and
                            various non-governmental political persons to move in this direction.
                            Many specific political projects now under consideration or under way in
                            South Viet Nam would begin to take better shape if they were related to
                            the making of a national political party; for example, the proposed <pb n="695" xml:id="pg_695" facs="0727"/>Advisory Group, the attempts to
                            formulate national objectives; to design a national economic
                            reconstruction and development plan; to mobilize student leaders; to
                            create a domestic peace corps; etc.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. The Military and the Future of Politics and
                            Administration in South Viet Nam</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Proposal</hi>. That we begin to consider with a few
                            selected military leaders in South Viet Nam how the military
                            organization now fighting the Viet Cong can, in the future, be used to
                            bridge the gap until the time that a stable, civil politics can fully
                            take hold.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Discussion</hi>. At the moment the military
                            structure in South Viet Nam holds the country together and represents
                            the biggest single pool of administrative competence. It probably also
                            contains many of the men most capable of assuming political leadership
                            in the postwar phase of the country. Until the kind of party proposed in
                            suggestion A, above, comes into being and generates momentum, the
                            country will have to rely heavily on the army for both administrative
                            skill and political leadership.</p>
                        <p>This could take many forms:</p>
                        <p>—A massive civic action and public works rehabilitation program;</p>
                        <p>—The actual transfer of competent officers into civil administrative
                            posts;</p>
                        <p>—The kind of literacy and agricultural education programs the Korean army
                            has conducted;</p>
                        <p>—The packing away of their uniforms by key officers as they assumed full
                            time political life.</p>
                        <p>In short, as we look ahead to the future of South Viet Nam, we should be
                            looking at the army as a critically important administrative and
                            political asset; and, as suggested in proposal A, the Korean experience
                            should be made fully available to our friends in South Viet Nam.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Action</hi>. That we suggest this line of thought to
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>; make available
                            to him full details of the Korean experience on the transitional role of
                            the military in these various civil functions; and encourage the
                            Koreans, under proposal A, to widen their discussions with the South
                            Vietnamese to include this range of issues.</p>

                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Proposal</hi>. That we systematically bomb the oil
                            refining and storage capacity and the electric power facilities in North
                            Viet Nam.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Discussion</hi>. Thought in this town is split
                            between those who advocate massive and somewhat generalized air attacks
                            on the Hanoi-Haiphong complex and those who fear that such attacks would
                            dangerously escalate the war, deny Hanoi a stake in its future by
                            destroying what has been built over the last decade, and lead to a
                            last-ditch mentality which would make a negotiated settlement
                            impossible.</p>
                        <p>As you know, I have long felt that the proper course of action was a
                            systematic but surgical use of air power to take out the oil refining
                            and storage capability and electric power systems in the Hanoi-Haiphong
                            area. This would exact a considerable cost but still leave the cities
                            and factories standing. Given the possibilities of protracting the war
                            by continued infiltration, this has seemed the only practical way to
                            force Hanoi to pay a price sufficient to induce them to negotiate soon,
                            without denying them a future.</p>
                        <p>It is difficult for those who did not live through the application of
                            systematic, precision bombing against the German air force, German oil
                            facilities, and the Seine-Loire bridges to understand how vastly more
                            effective this kind of bombing is than generalized air attacks. By
                            systematic, I mean the attack on all the major plants in a given target
                            system.</p>
                        <p>In the Far Eastern war we conducted generalized bombing against Japan,
                            including the burning of cities. In the Korean war we hit everything we
                            could see and a lot we couldn't see.</p>
                        <p>No one can tell you for certain—and only an irresponsible man would
                            guarantee to you—that this kind of precise, systematic application of
                            force will tip the balance of thought and policy in Hanoi to the
                            acceptance of the kind of negotiation we envisage. Clearly, we must
                            continue to hold them on the ground in the south and exact there a high
                            price for continued aggression. Clearly, we must maintain minimum
                            political stability in Saigon; for they would be tempted to continue the
                            war, even if hamstrung around Hanoi, if their prospects for early
                            military or political victory in the south were good.</p>
                        <p>For what it is worth, however, my judgment is this:</p>
                        <p>—We have an enormous stake at home and abroad in forcing an early, rather
                            than late, ending to the war in Viet Nam.</p>
                        <p>—There is a possibility that this kind of purposeful, systematic, and
                            surgical attack on the Hanoi-Haiphong oil and power installations <pb n="697" xml:id="pg_697" facs="0729"/>might so limit the economic and
                            military capacity of North Viet Nam that those who now argue for a
                            negotiated settlement in Hanoi might, at last, prevail.</p>
                        <p>—The North Vietnamese civil casualties involved could be quite severely
                            limited if the operations are well planned; and we should be conscious
                            that our present level of sorties in armed reconnaissance and other
                            attacks are imposing some civilian casualties on them and the loss of
                            some of our own finest and best-trained men.</p>
                        <p>—This kind of attack is not likely to change radically the degree of
                            Soviet and Chinese Communist involvement in the war.</p>
                        <p>—Such attacks will heighten the noise level in the Free World against us,
                            but, if our backs remain stiff, it will also heighten the pressure on
                            Hanoi from the outside to negotiate, including, especially, the pressure
                            from Moscow.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Action</hi>. That we proceed early in the New Year
                            to go swiftly and purposefully into the systematic attack on oil and
                            electric power, but try to establish—even before the attacks—direct
                            diplomatic contact with Hanoi, as suggested in proposal D.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">D. Direct Contact With a Representative of
                            Hanoi</p>
                        <p>1 <hi rend="italic">Proposal</hi>. That we soon quietly establish, at our
                            initiative, direct diplomatic contact with a representative of
                            Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>. In all the other postwar
                            confrontations with Communists, there was no great problem of
                            communication when they decided to cease their aggression. They either
                            knocked it off without talking to us, as in the case of the Greek
                            guerrilla campaign, or they found a way to communicate through
                            diplomatic channels, as in the case of the Berlin blockade of 1948-49,
                            the Korean war, and the Cuban missile crisis.</p>
                        <p>In these cases of communication, we were then, however, dealing with
                            Russians. And, when the time comes, this is the way it may be again.</p>
                        <p>But the fact is that Hanoi, not Moscow, is the center of this war; it is
                            in a complex relation to both the Chinese Communists and the Soviet
                            Communists; in the long run it must live with Communist China, even if
                            it decides to negotiate; and, thus, the Sino-Soviet split makes it hard
                            for them to turn wholly to Moscow at this critical moment in their
                            history.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, direct contact with us may facilitate getting over the hump
                            into negotiations—even if what we discuss is whom to talk to and
                            where.</p>
                        <p>Hanoi's position is compounded by the fact that if they knock off the
                            war, without negotiations, they leave the U.S. with all our troops and
                            bases in South Viet Nam and with great freedom of action. For that
                            reason alone, they may be led to get the best deal they can out of a
                            negotiation, including our withdrawal; but negotiations in the midst of
                            a large <pb n="698" xml:id="pg_698" facs="0730"/>guerrilla war are
                            exceedingly complex and require quite a bit of talk to get started.</p>
                        <p>I am led to the view that a direct contact would be useful for another
                            reason. Every war game I have been involved in has been marked by
                            signals that were not accurately read. One side will say something or do
                            something designed to give the other side a message; but the receiving
                            side will not hear or it will misinterpret the message.</p>
                        <p>Now we and the Russians have been at this game for a generation. And we
                            rarely misread each other's messages. But this has taken a long time;
                            and our communications are thick—operating at many places and
                            levels.</p>
                        <p>We must constantly bear in mind that, this time, we are not dealing with
                            a self-confident major power. We are dealing with a small, provincial,
                            isolated power which has had little contact with us, and is caught up
                            between two allies who are bitterly contending with one another.</p>
                        <p>Finally, our experience with third parties, however well meaning,
                            suggests that they are not necessarily accurate; they leak; and they are
                            too often bucking for a Nobel Peace prize.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Action</hi>. That we consider promptly establishing a
                            direct contact with a North Vietnamese representative. I would not
                            pretend to expertise, but <persName corresp="#p_MVBR1">Mai Van
                                Bo</persName> in Paris would be my first choice, for two reasons: he
                            is quite high in rank; and Paris is a big city, easier for quiet
                            contacts than most of the alternatives. Cairo, Vientiane, and Djakarta
                            are other possibilities. If discovered, we should simply say that if we
                            can talk with the Chinese Communists, we can certainly talk with the
                            North Vietnamese Communists. The contact should be set up, if possible,
                            before the bombing attacks suggested in proposal C. The first message
                            should be an authoritative statement of all our present negotiating
                            proposals. We should remain in contact steadily as the air attack
                            mounts. If there is any indication of willingness to negotiate, we
                            should be willing to explore formulae which would save Hanoi's face and
                            offer a golden bridge of retreat.</p>
                        <p>It is wholly possible that they will not be willing to make direct
                            contact with us; but, especially if we plan to increase the heat on
                            Hanoi-Haiphong, it is appropriate to try.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                        <p>To summarize quickly, the United States in ten years has moved from the
                            provision of military assistance to Viet Nam, through the furnishing of
                            military advisers, the increase of their numbers and giving them an
                            active role in combat, to infusing ever larger contingents of American
                            fighting men in organized units to wage the war against the Communists.
                            At the end of 1965's long monsoon season, we are evidently not poised
                            for dramatic gains and military victory.</p>
                        <p>We confront a limited number of choices: (1) to seek negotiations now;
                            (2) to continue military operations at recent levels, with the aim of
                            inducing a greater disposition on the part of the Communists to
                            negotiate; (3) to increase three-fold or more our already heavy military
                            investment in Viet Nam in order to crush North Viet Nam and wipe out the
                            Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>Experience to date negatives any likelihood that carrying on the war will
                            improve the prospects of negotiation. Stepping up the US military
                            commitment to somewhere between 500,000 and one million American
                            troops—in order to eliminate the Communist opposition in Viet
                            Nam—threatens the following consequences: greatly increased US
                            casualties, on a scale not known since World War II; substantially
                            increased taxes at home, probably accompanied by inflation and
                            increasing economic and social dislocations; an end, for practical
                            purposes, to the struggle against poverty at home and the building of
                            the Great Society; escalation of the Viet Nam conflict that could put
                            the US in a war with Communist China, whose magnitude and course are
                            withheld from our view today.</p>
                        <p>The net of this paper is that we will do better to accept the fact of
                            conflict in Viet Nam and seek to transfer it to the political plane; to
                            wait out with patience and intelligent action the long period while
                            Vietnamese nationalism gradually asserts itself against China, and while
                            China goes through the process of development enabling it to function—in
                            the way the Soviet Union has come to function—as a member of the
                            community of nations.</p>

                        <p>For the United States—with the aims and purposes we hold—the path is
                            narrow between prevention or frustration of forcible aggression, on the
                            one hand, and being drawn into actions that lead progressively to
                            larger—and perhaps nuclear—conflict, on the other. There have been
                            signs, coming out of Hanoi, Peking, and Moscow that we may be better
                            able to pursue our aims at this stage through shifting to a political
                            and diplomatic offensive. We are at a point where it may be possible to
                            strengthen significantly the hand of the peace party throughout the
                            Communist camp.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Suggestions</p>
                        <p>An armistice. The basic idea advanced here is that we want a cessation of
                            fighting in Viet Nam followed by negotiations. It should be a total
                            cessation, of ground action in the South, of air strikes against the
                            North, of terrorism in the cities and in the countryside. The cessation
                            could be initiated in connection with the observance of Tet in Viet Nam.
                            It could be related to a public appeal that selected governments or Pope
                            Paul VI might address to all the authorities concerned. The cessation
                            could be proclaimed for a fixed time period (such as 30 days) and could
                            be extended without limit of time if satisfactory steps were being taken
                            with a view to negotiated settlement; this feature should probably be
                            made clear from the outset.</p>
                        <p>Whether such an armistice could last would, of course, depend on the
                            willingness of the two sides. We should test the Communist side to see
                            whether it would keep a cease-fire. An armistice seriously intended by
                            both sides could survive incidents of violation through mistake or
                            misunderstanding. If the Communist side breached the armistice, this
                            would quickly be apparent. The US and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would be free to resume military operations. The
                            responsibility would be clear, and this should have a good effect in
                            furthering greater understanding and increased support for US policy
                            toward Viet Nam.</p>
                        <p>Upon the taking effect of an armistice, neither side would stand down its
                            preparations, reinforcement, etc. If fighting had to be resumed,
                            relative military advantage would be essentially unchanged. But this is
                            not a state of affairs we should wish to see indefinitely continued. We
                            should want to see the process of armament and military preparation put
                            in reverse. This can only be done as the result of negotiated
                            agreements.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Negotiation</hi>. At the earliest possible time the
                            United States should make a formal and comprehensive statement of our
                            aims in Viet Nam. You summed them up very cogently at the end of the
                            large staff meeting this last Thursday morning. A statement like this
                            should be made to press, radio and TV. The text should be formally
                            communicated to governments around the world. We should take pains to
                            see that it is delivered to Hanoi—through the French, the Canadians,
                            India, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, <pb n="701" xml:id="pg_701" facs="0733"/>other Eastern European countries, etc.
                            This could be a factor in deciding the debates that must now be going on
                            in Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>Once an armistice is begun, a peace conference should follow whatever
                            reasonable time is required to prepare it. There are many ways of
                            organizing a conference. The Geneva Co-Chairmen could take the
                            initiative. A meeting of 14 nations could be convened, or it could be
                            limited to some of them. Perhaps the meeting should involve directly
                            only Hanoi, the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>, Saigon and the
                            United States. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could stay in the background and seek
                            to act as catalysts in the negotiating process. We should not exclude
                            from consideration the idea of Communist China being absent from the
                            international meetings, except to attend a formal conference of larger
                            size which would confirm the understandings reached by a smaller group.
                            We should look forward to protracted discussions. So long as the
                            armistice were kept, we should be prepared to engage in a very long
                            negotiation.</p>
                        <p>It is impossible at this stage to block out the contents of a settlement.
                            Terms can emerge only from prolonged and close bargaining and the
                            inter-action of negotiating efforts. Negotiation might run through a
                            series of phases, just as a settlement itself would have multiple
                            phases.</p>
                        <p>An early subject of discussion should probably be observation and
                            policing of the armistice. International teams of military
                            observers—perhaps made up of Commonwealth and Bloc personnel—might be
                            employed. Withdrawal of military forces should be a focus of attention.
                            International observation could identify what forces are present in Viet
                            Nam, and could later verify and supervise an agreed withdrawal—perhaps
                            first to staging areas, some for North Vietnamese units and others for
                            US forces. Ultimately, all foreign forces would be withdrawn from South
                            Viet Nam.</p>
                        <p>One of the most difficult of all questions is what to do about the Viet
                            Cong and their weapons. It is not likely to be practicable to segregate
                            them in any supervised garrison areas. Experience with the disarming of
                            insurgents and the central collection of their weapons gives no ground
                            for believing this would be feasible in South Viet Nam. The Viet Cong
                            would have to be left alone during the armistice, as would the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s military units. The military problem
                            is likely to be solved only after a new political structure has been
                            created in the South, following on internationally supervised elections,
                            the establishment of a representative assembly, and the effective
                            functioning of institutions of local government.</p>

                            of negotiation as well as afterward there would be great value in a wide
                            program of international assistance for the reconstruction of South Viet
                            Nam. Organizations such as the United Nations, the FAO, and voluntary
                            agencies could perform great humanitarian service and also contribute
                            significantly to <pb n="702" xml:id="pg_702" facs="0734"/>political
                            settlement through the provision of needed food and medical relief,

                            for civilian use, and personnel to help with community services. It
                            might be possible for a large and imaginative program of this sort to
                            supply the needs of local government for a substantial period of
                            time—obviating the assertion of authority and the exercise of control by
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> or Viet Cong in disputed areas.
                            The US should be prepared to contribute largely to the financing of such
                            a program, which would have to be under neutral direction. We should
                            seek also at an early date to give practical effect to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s long-standing offer
                            to arrange for the participation of North Viet Nam in an internationally
                            aided program of economic development for Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Humanitarian measures</hi>. Whether or not an
                            armistice is arranged in the near future, we should make every effort to
                            proceed with an exchange of prisoners held by the two sides in Viet Nam.
                            This could be undertaken by the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>
                            along with its other responsibilities. Exchanges need not be on a
                            one-for-one basis, but could be so calculated as to bring about the
                            repatriation of all prisoners held on each side. In the event of an
                            armistice, an early measure for consideration in the ensuing discussions
                            would be an amnesty for political prisoners and others detained on
                            account of offenses in connection with the war.</p>

                                (Department of State, Central Files, POL 27 VIET S)</note> regarding
                            the resumption of bombing in North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>1. Although I am not aware of all the considerations leading to the
                            continuation of the standdown in Rolling Thunder air operations over
                            North Vietnam, I consider that their immediate resumption is
                            essential.</p>
                        <pb n="703" xml:id="pg_703" facs="0735"/>
                        <p>2. Strictly from the standpoint of the war in South Vietnam it is
                            difficult to understand why the pressure has been taken off the nerve
                            center of direction, supply and manpower located in North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>3. Air attack against lines of communication is extremely difficult in
                            this part of the world. It is clear that air interdiction at any one
                            point can be circumvented by the Viet Cong/North Vietnamese forces and
                            all local obstacles can be overcome by ingenuity and hard work, both of
                            which they display in ample quantities. Therefore, our only hope of a
                            major impact on the ability of the North Vietnamese to support the war
                            in Vietnam is continuous air attack over the entire length of their
                            lines of communication from the Chinese border to South Vietnam, and
                            within South Vietnam. Although at any one point the impact may not be
                            great, the cumulative effect of armed reconnaissance, bridge busting,
                            rail cutting and barge sinking and forcing them to operate almost
                            exclusively at night, must be great.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding the heavy pressure on their transportation system over
                            the past 9 months, they have demonstrated an ability to deploy forces
                            into South Vietnam at a greater rate than we are now deploying US
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>4. I notice that since the 3d of September, there has been a steady
                            decrease in ordnance delivering sorties over North Vietnam. During the
                            period 3 to 16 September, 982 such sorties were flown. By 15 to 28
                            October, this had been reduced to 700, and in the period 10 to 23
                            December, it had further diminished to 662. I recognize that part of
                            this can be explained in increased activity in Laos, but this does not
                            change the basic fact that our pressure against North Vietnam is
                            decreasing.</p>
                        <p>5. Considering the course of the war in South Vietnam and the capability
                            which has been built up here by the Viet Cong/North Vietnamese
                            forces—the full impact of which we have not yet felt—the curtailment of
                            operations in North Vietnam is unsound from a military standpoint.
                            Indeed, we should now step up our effort to higher levels.<note n="3" xml:id="d245fn3">Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAUSG1">Sharp</persName> in Honolulu sent comments that were relayed to

                        <p>“3. I have recommended programs for Rolling Thunder designed steadily to
                            increase the pressure on North Vietnam. These programs will drastically
                            reduce the flow of military supplies reaching North Vietnam and hence
                            the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>“4. The armed forces of the United States should not be required to fight

                        <p>1. Duncan Wood of Friends Service Committee told me today that meeting
                            with <persName corresp="#p_MVBR1">Mai Van Bo</persName> on 21st in Paris
                            not productive. Wood and Wolfe Mendel spent about hour with Bo, who
                            rather ill at ease.</p>
                        <p>2. Bo had no response re Quaker offer aid to <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, promised to let Committee know when or if received.

                            conversation to discussion differences family life in England,

                        <p rend="center">THE HEART OF THE MATTER IN VIET-NAM</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. The Fact of Aggression</p>
                        <p>The simple fact is that tens of thousands of trained and armed men,
                            including units of the North Vietnamese regular army, have been sent by
                                <pb n="705" xml:id="pg_705" facs="0737"/>Hanoi into South Viet-Nam
                            for the purpose of imposing Hanoi's will on South Viet-Nam by force. It
                            is this external aggression which is responsible for the presence of
                            U.S. combat forces. Indeed, it was not until the early summer of 1965
                            that the number of U.S. military personnel in South Viet-Nam reached the
                            number of those which have been infiltrated by Hanoi. If this aggression
                            from the outside were removed, U.S. combat forces would not be
                            needed.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. The U.S. Commitment</p>
                        <p>The United States has a clear and direct commitment to the security of
                            South Viet-Nam against external attack. This commitment is based upon
                            bilateral agreements between the United States and South Viet-Nam, upon
                            the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Treaty (whose obligations
                            are both joint and several), upon annual actions by the Congress in
                            providing aid to South Viet-Nam, upon the policy expressed in such
                            Congressional action as the August 1964 resolution, and upon the solemn
                            declarations of three U.S. Presidents. At stake is not just South
                            Vietnam, nor even Southeast Asia; there is also at stake the integrity
                            of a U.S. commitment and the importance of that commitment to the peace
                            right around the globe.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Initiatives for Peace</p>
                        <p>A. We are not aware of any initiative which has been taken by Hanoi
                            during the past five years to seek peace in Southeast Asia. Reports of
                            “peace feelers” have to do with initiatives by third parties. Hanoi has
                            denied that it has ever made any “peace feelers”. We ourselves know of
                            none. During 1965 Hanoi has consistently insisted that its four points
                            must be accepted as the sole basis for peace in Viet-Nam. The third of
                            these four points would require the imposition of the program of the
                            liberation front upon South Viet-Nam, whether the South Vietnamese
                            wanted it or not.</p>
                        <p>B. The initiatives for peace undertaken by our side, and by many other
                            governments, would be hard to count. They began with President Kennedy's
                            talk with Premier Khrushchev in Vienna in June 1961 and have not ceased.
                            The publicly known initiatives have been multiplied many times by
                            private initiatives not yet disclosed. On the public record, however,
                            are the following instances:</p>
                        <p>1. Kennedy-Khrushchev talks in June 1961;</p>
                        <p>2. Geneva Conference on Laos;</p>

                        <p>The following statements are on the public record about elements which
                            the U.S. believes can go into peace in Southeast Asia;<note n="2" xml:id="d247fn2">These 14 points appeared in The Washington Post,
                                December 29, 1965.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. The Geneva Agreements of 1954 and 1962 are an adequate basis for peace
                            in Southeast Asia;</p>
                        <p>2. We would welcome a conference on Southeast Asia or on any part
                            thereof;</p>
                        <p>3. We would welcome “negotiations without pre-conditions” as the 17
                            nations put it;</p>
                        <p>4. We would welcome unconditional discussions as President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> put it;</p>
                        <p>5. A cessation of hostilities could be the first order of business at a
                            conference or could be the subject of preliminary discussions;</p>
                        <p>6. Hanoi's four points could be discussed along with other points which
                            others might wish to propose;</p>
                        <p>7. We want no U.S. bases in Southeast Asia;</p>
                        <p>8. We do not desire to retain U.S. troops in South Viet-Nam after peace
                            is assured;</p>
                        <p>9. We support free elections in South Viet-Nam to give the South
                            Vietnamese a government of their own choice;</p>
                        <p>10. The question of reunification of Viet-Nam should be determined by the
                            Vietnamese through their own free decision;</p>
                        <p>11. The countries of Southeast Asia can be non-aligned or neutral if that
                            be their option;</p>
                        <p>12. We would much prefer to use our resources for the economic
                            reconstruction of Southeast Asia than in war. If there is peace, North
                            Viet-Nam could participate in a regional effort to which we would be
                            prepared to contribute at least one billion dollars;</p>
                        <p>13. The President has said “The Viet Cong would not have difficulty being
                            represented and having their views represented if for a moment Hanoi
                            decided she wanted to cease aggression. I don't think that would be an
                            insurmountable problem.”</p>
                        <pb n="707" xml:id="pg_707" facs="0739"/>
                        <p>14. We have said publicly and privately that we could stop the bombing of
                            North Viet-Nam as a step toward peace although there has not been the
                            slightest hint or suggestion from the other side as to what they would
                            do if the bombing stopped.</p>
                        <p>In other words, we have put everything into the basket of peace except
                            the surrender of South Viet-Nam.</p>

                            points, but took out the clear objections in Hanoi's formulation. A more
                            systematic effort in this direction might be used as a framework for an
                            offer to negotiate on the basis of such a four-point statement. This
                                would<pb n="708" xml:id="pg_708" facs="0740"/> have the appeal in
                            many world quarters, and among sophisticated domestic critics such as
                            the New York Times, of using Hanoi's own framework and indicating the
                            general principles which would be acceptable. It could be stated as a
                            possible basis for negotiations, while we reiterated at the same time
                            that we were prepared for negotiations without any conditions or basis
                            whatever, or—as we explicitly said in the Fanfani reply—on the basis of
                            Geneva Accords of 1954. If we provided two or three possible
                            formulations, it would tend to strengthen our position verbally, without
                            any substantive change.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Bombing Position.</p>
                        <p>Assuming that we do not continue the Christmas pause, the next possible
                            occasion for a pause would be the stand-down of all military operations
                            that we have now virtually agreed with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to take place over Tet, January 21-23. With a three-day
                            opening period already agreed, we might well extend this for another ten
                            days and take the prior diplomatic measures that we have all considered
                            useful and indeed essential in the pause scenario discussed in the last
                            six weeks. I would most emphatically not recommend a pause at this or
                            any other time that lasted for less than about two weeks. It must be
                            long enough to be convincing to third countries that a serious
                            opportunity was given for diplomatic activity. Similarly, it must be
                            preceded by careful consultation with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and our key allies, and by messages at the last moment
                            to Hanoi through various possible intermediary channels.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Pacing our Bombing in Accordance with
                            Communist Activity in the South.</p>
                        <p>Many of us have felt for some time that our bombing of the North would be
                            much more effective in the military and psychological sense if it were
                            more irregular in pattern in any case. It may be too difficult to
                            introduce daily variation pegged to the level of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> activity in the preceding day or two, as today's
                            Washington Post seems to be suggesting. However, we could make a general
                            statement that the level of our bombing in the North would be governed
                            by the pace of Communist activity in the South in the preceding period
                            (not specified). This would have the advantage of a built-in
                            justification for increasing the level of our bombing if Communist
                            activity increases. But it would also have the “peace” significance of
                            opening the way for the other side, by reducing its own activity, to
                            bring about a reduction in our bombing and thus to open the way to what
                            Kennan and others have urged as a progressive de-escalation of
                            hostilities. At the same time, this line of approach is inherently more
                            controllable than an outright pause and leaves the way open to increases
                            that do not raise the problem of outright resumption after a pause.</p>

                        <p>We have already started probing with the British the question of their
                            discussing this with the Soviets and the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> members. We have Sihanouk's own request for expanded
                                <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> supervision in certain areas,
                            and the issue is one that is wholly consistent with our own past
                            position. Conceivably it might be a matter for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council discussion, but only if the Soviets
                            fully agreed. I would be much more favorable to a co-chairmen/<gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> format, which could produce discussions
                            that might go beyond Cambodia, although this should emphatically not be
                            stated as a purpose at the outset. This strikes me as a useful
                            initiative in any event, although of limited utility at least for a time
                            in meeting any need for a Vietnam peace initiative.</p>

                        <p>1. I had a meeting of second-level public relations people dealing with
                            Viet Nam this afternoon, and they all said very strongly, that if the
                            pause goes more than another day or so, it should go long enough to be a
                            real answer to our critics. Otherwise, we would fall between two stools
                            and get criticized by the military without making any money with the
                            peacemakers. I argued with them, but I think the point has force.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill Moyers</persName> has reaffirmed to
                            me this afternoon his own feeling that since we have gone these days, we
                            should go on through New Year's Day. He thinks we will be heavily
                            criticized for a half-hearted effort if we resume now.</p>
                        <p>3. Most interestingly, General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> came to see me this afternoon to say that he now
                            feels very strongly that since we have endured three <pb n="710" xml:id="pg_710" facs="0742"/>days of pause, we might as well go on
                            for long enough to take the starch out of the idea once and for all. He
                            also undertook to write personally to Westie and to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAUSG1">Sharp</persName> if you decide to continue the
                            current suspension and to explain to them the great importance of this
                            course of action from the point of view of proving to the American
                            public that we have left no door to peace untried.<note n="2" xml:id="d249fn2">See <ref target="#d252">Document 252</ref>.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said that he does not
                            think the military cost is great. He thinks the political reward of a
                            solid pause is worth it at this stage.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>As the New Year approaches, I am sure that the thought uppermost in your
                            mind and that of your senior advisers is what to do about Viet-Nam in
                            1966. Not knowing exactly the present state of development of plans
                            within the government, I am venturing to convey to you some of my
                            personal views as to the goals set for next year.</p>
                        <p>Our overall objective remains that of assuring South Viet-Nam the right
                            to determine its own form of government and its own way of life <pb n="711" xml:id="pg_711" facs="0743"/>without having to accept a
                            Communist government imposed by Hanoi. It may or may not be possible to
                            attain this objective in 1966; we should, however, establish ambitious
                            bench marks in all sectors of our endeavors which, if reached, should
                            offer a reasonable hope of convincing the Communist leaders that the
                            invincibility of the “War of Liberation” being waged in South Viet-Nam
                            is a myth and hence they had better change their game.</p>
                        <p>In seeking to establish an objective for the ground combat in South
                            Viet-Nam during 1966, I would suggest its expression in terms of
                            population made sufficiently secure to permit progress by the
                            non-military agencies in developing the secured areas. At present, it is
                            estimated (although the estimate is sometimes challenged) that about 53
                            percent of the population is already in this state of security. If we
                            took some figure like 75-80 percent of the population as our year-end
                            goal for security, it would have the effect of focusing the military
                            effort more specifically on population as our primary objective rather
                            than territory. If we take control of territory as our goal, it invites
                            us to disperse our forces throughout the jungles and forests of
                            negligible military and political value and into terrain most favorable
                            to the military operations of the enemy. It will create endless U.S.
                            troop requirements if we undertake to pursue the guerrilla bands into
                            the remote fastnesses of Viet-Nam; we had better concentrate our troop
                            resources on securing the maximum number of people and thus get the most
                            out of our deployments.</p>
                        <p>The role of our U.S. ground forces in this campaign for increased
                            population security should be primarily the destruction of mainline Viet
                            Cong-North Vietnamese units, preferably after they have been located by
                            South Vietnamese ground action. Let the South Vietnamese army find and
                            fix the enemy; we are best suited to hold and destroy them. I know that
                            no pat formula such as this can apply in all cases but it can serve as a
                            general guide. I have been disturbed by growing evidence from Saigon
                            that our military in South Viet-Nam are inclined to turn over all or
                            most of the heavy fighting to U.S. forces and allow the bulk of the
                            Vietnamese forces to retire behind a screen of U.S.-provided protection
                            to perform clearing jobs and local defense. At least half of the South
                            Vietnamese regular units should be used in mobile combat roles and some
                            such level of Vietnamese participation should be required by the U.S.
                            military authorities in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>It is more difficult to set concrete goals in the area of development and
                            rural reconstruction. I would suggest one, however; namely, that we take
                            as a 1966 objective the conduct of free elections in all the secure
                            areas of South Viet-Nam for the purpose of electing a constituent
                            assembly. If all elements of civil government are oriented toward this
                            goal, I would expect substantial progress to be made in all the
                            subordinate programs for such purposes as the improvement of
                            administration, agriculture, distribution of commodities, public health
                            and the like. For our part, we <pb n="712" xml:id="pg_712" facs="0744"/>should indicate our unequivocal support for such elections and our
                            willingness to accept the results whatever they may be.</p>
                        <p>In planning the air campaign against North Viet-Nam for 1966, we should
                            first remind ourselves of the three purposes we had in starting it in
                            February, 1965. First, there was the need to give the South Vietnamese
                            the opportunity for the first time in eleven years of conflict to strike
                            back at the source of all their troubles; it also gave us an opportunity
                            to retaliate for such terrorist attacks as the mortaring of the Bien Hoa
                            air base, the bombing of the Brink hotel and the attack on U.S. barracks
                            at Pleiku. Second, there was the need to use our air superiority to
                            retard and make more difficult the continued infiltration of men and
                            materiel from North Viet-Nam into South Viet-Nam. No one expected air
                            power alone to be able to stop infiltration and clearly it has not. But
                            any serious examination of the physical destruction of our bombings and
                            the effect on daily circulation of our armed reconnaissance is bound to
                            conclude that the air campaign has made life very difficult for those in
                            the North who are supporting the Viet Cong insurgency.</p>
                        <p>The third and, in the long run, the most important purpose of our
                            bombings was and is to convince the Hanoi leaders that the aggression
                            must stop or they will have to pay an increasingly high price for its
                            continuance. We are all aware that they have thus far given no
                            indication of an intention to mend their ways. But neither did the
                            leaders in Moscow give any intention of calling off the Berlin airlift
                            or the North Korean-Chicom leaders of abandoning their effort to take
                            over South Korea until the game had been played down to the last card.
                            Up to that point, their attitude was one of defiant, aggressive
                            confidence. We should expect nothing different from Hanoi now. The
                            leaders there still hope that international or U.S. domestic pressures
                            will cause us to weaken and modify our purpose—or perhaps the Saigon
                            Government may cave in as it has in the past. Until these hopes prove
                            vain, I am convinced we must keep up the pressure and pursue inexorably
                            a bold offensive course in 1966.</p>
                        <p>In this spirit, I would recommend that, during 1966, we continue the
                            deliberate destruction of all fixed targets in North Viet-Nam outside of
                            heavily populated areas which have any relation to the war-supporting
                            capability of North Viet-Nam and continue to interdict road and rail
                            movement throughout the country. This will require after due warning the
                            aerial mining of the principal ports. In order to increase the
                            reluctance of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to denude North
                            Viet-Nam of army units to reinforce the Viet Cong in South Viet-Nam, it
                            may be desirable to encourage the South Vietnamese to conduct commando
                            raids with U.S. support along the North Vietnamese coast to give an
                            occasional reminder that the ground of North Viet-Nam may eventually be
                            no more of a sanctuary than its air space.</p>
                        <pb n="713" xml:id="pg_713" facs="0745"/>
                        <p>On the politico-economic front in Saigon, we need to sustain and improve
                            the <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> government and work
                            increasingly to hold inflation within bounds. We also need to keep the
                            Saigon political leaders in mental step with us as we plan for the
                            termination of hostilities. If, as I believe, we are going to be obliged
                            to take the Viet Cong in some form into any negotiation, we need to work
                            hard now to overcome the inevitable objections of our ally.</p>
                        <p>In conditioning Hanoi for negotiation, we need to work much harder in
                            1966 to carry the message to the people of North Viet-Nam and to the
                            Viet Cong that a better life awaits them if they abandon their
                            aggression against the south. Some of the specific advantages need to be
                            spelled out more precisely than up to now. All our propaganda activities
                            should then be directed at getting this message to a people who must be
                            coming increasingly unhappy under the burdens of war.</p>
                        <p>On our domestic front, I am sure you will agree that there is continuing
                            work to be done in explaining the Viet-Nam situation to our people.
                            Since returning to the U.S. in August, I have made nearly fifty speaking
                            or TV appearances from which I have drawn two conclusions. The
                            substantial people of the country are solidly behind the actions of our
                            government but there is wide-spread criticism that the government does
                            not adequately explain what is going on. There is even some suspicion
                            that this government is holding back and perhaps concealing some of the
                            facts. At the moment, in many quarters there is an unreasoning
                            confidence in negotiations as an end in themselves and their initiation
                            as necessarily synonymous with the restoration of peace. Our people need
                            to be reminded again and again of our Korean experience—twenty-five
                            months of negotiations while we lost some 46,000 American and 150,000
                            allied casualties. I suggest the need in 1966 of many more high-level
                            explanations to our people of the basic issues in South Viet-Nam to give
                            them the feeling of being taken more into the confidence of their
                            government.</p>
                        <p>In closing, let me say that, as one of your advisers, I am not
                            discouraged or dismayed by the prospects in Viet-Nam for 1966—provided
                            we stay on course and refuse to be diverted from the overall objective
                            which you have stated so many times—the independence of South Viet-Nam
                            and its freedom from attack. My attention was recently drawn to a
                            staunch sentence of Sir Francis Drake which gives me considerable
                            comfort in such times as these. “There must be a beginning of every
                            matter but it is continuing unto the end that yields the true
                            glory.”</p>
                        <p>With warm regards for a New Year which will bring its share of glory,</p>
                        <p>Respectfully,</p>

                            misunderstandings; if we start now we would be under a handicap of doing
                            a four days pause. They had a rather lengthy discussion of the problem.
                            Sec was inclined to go ahead with the bombing and perhaps have another
                            pause beginnning with our new year; we cannot count these four days if
                            we expect to develop a pause from a diplomatic point of view; it also
                            misleads Vietnamese for we have not developed with them the concept of a

                        <p>1. I talked to Dean Rusk <note n="2" xml:id="d252fn2">See <ref target="#d251">Document 251</ref>.</note> to urge him to get on
                            every diplomatic wire and tell people that there has been no noise over
                            North Vietnam for four days and that we certainly would like to know it
                            if anyone has heard any signal of any sort that this lack of action has
                            done any good. I found him very resistant indeed and he told me that he
                            and Alex Johnson and Tommy Thompson and my brother <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName> all think that we cannot get
                            diplomatic mileage this way. They really would prefer to resume bombing
                            right away and have a longer pause later on, with advance notice to the
                            Russians, as they initially recommended last week.</p>
                        <p>2. I tried gently to say to Dean that this was not the present problem. I
                            said that I thought we now had a 4-day start and the question was what
                            use we could make of it if we continued for another period of up to a
                            week. He continued to resist my suggestion, and I do not feel that I
                            should make further diplomatic contacts tonight behind his back.</p>
                        <p>3. What I do think is that if you should decide—as I myself hope you
                            may—that it makes sense to withhold the bombing for another several
                            days, you might then speak to the Secretary yourself about the
                            usefulness of directing the attention of every available diplomat to the
                            fact that there is a pause and the further fact that we certainly want
                            to know it if anyone has any way of finding out whether there is any
                            prospect of a response.</p>

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> called me from
                            the Ranch to ask my opinion of an extension of the Christmas bombing
                            pause in North Viet-Nam. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> was on the line. The President explained his
                            feeling of the need of the extension to meet domestic opinion and to
                            strengthen all fences prior to asking the Congress for more funds and
                            more men for Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>He had had a strong message from Westy and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAUSG1">Sharp</persName> supporting an immediate
                            resumption of the bombing of North Viet-Nam<note n="2" xml:id="d253fn2">See <ref target="#d245">Document 245</ref> and <ref target="#d245fn3">footnote 3</ref> thereto.</note> and was
                            clearly reluctant to override their military arguments. I told him that
                            I had always opposed a pause in the bombing, feeling that it was futile
                            to expect Hanoi to make any responsive moves during a pause while
                            international attention was concentrated upon their every move. I
                            expressed the view from a military point of view the commanders were
                            right and we should get on with the bombing campaign.</p>
                        <p>However, in my judgment, a few days delay would not matter from a
                            military point of view if the President felt that, by an extension of
                            the cease-fire, he could expose once and for all the futility of
                            expecting reasonableness from the leadership in Hanoi and Peking. I felt
                            there was no danger to our troops in terms of loss of life or exposure
                            to attack as the result of the extension of the bombing pause for a few
                            days.</p>
                        <p>I repeated my often expressed fear of being trapped into extended
                            negotiations in the course of a pause.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed his determination not to be caught and to resume
                            bombing within a few days as soon as he had given our opponents a
                            reasonable chance to respond to the extension of the cease-fire.</p>

                            of the week beginning January 2, 1966. At 10:55 p.m. on December 27,
                            Rusk called the Department of State Operations Center and asked that

                        <p>1. President has given most searching consideration to question of
                            further delay in resumption of bombing of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, and has taken fully into account views expressed by
                            you and Westmoreland on this subject.<note n="2" xml:id="d255fn2">See
                                    <ref target="#d245">Document 245</ref>.</note> He has decided
                            that he wishes to defer resumption of bombing for several more days,
                            possibly into middle of next week. No commitments would be made,
                            publicly or privately, which would limit our freedom of action in the
                            event of a major contingency or serious provocation. Air, ground, and
                            sea operations in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> would continue,
                            including Arc Light, as well as air operations in Laos.</p>
                        <p>2. For your own personal guidance, a major factor in decision is the
                            action which will have to be made public in January. The prospect of
                            large scale reinforcement in men and defense budget increases of some
                            twenty billions for next eighteen month period requires solid
                            preparation of American public. A crucial element will be clear
                            demonstration that we have explored fully every alternative but that
                            aggressor has left us no choice.</p>
                        <p>3. We do not, quite frankly, anticipate that Hanoi will respond in any
                            significant way. We have seen nothing in the mass of speculation or <pb n="718" xml:id="pg_718" facs="0750"/>diplomatic gossip pointing to
                            an interest in peace on Hanoi's part and we have certainly had no such
                            indication through any official channel. If, contrary to our
                            expectations, there was some significant response, we would of course be
                            in touch with you immediately. Thus, we do not want to commit ourselves
                            irrevocably to a specific date for resumption.</p>
                        <p>4. While confidential until published this week, most recent Harris poll
                            will show that 73% of American people would favor renewed effort for
                            cease-fire (including 64% of Goldwater voters) and 59% would favor
                            bombing pause (including 48% of Goldwater voters). Same poll will show
                            61% favoring increased bombing effort if cease-fire or pause fails to
                            elicit interest of other side. Such polls do not make decisions, but
                            they illustrate need to prepare our people for major sacrifices by
                            making it crystal clear where responsibility lies. Same problem is
                            reflected in Congress which will be reconvening on January 10 to face
                            hard facts of required national effort. The simple fact is that we must
                            sustain support for what has to be done in months ahead, if the other
                            side is not interested in peace. Compared to this over-riding
                            requirement, the destruction of the limited targets which would
                            otherwise be struck during this period is a secondary matter.</p>
                        <p>5. Underlying above reasons is our genuine interest in securing <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> without major bloodshed if that can be
                            accomplished. There is only the slimmest of chances that suspension of
                            bombing will be occasion for basic change of objective by other side but
                            communist propaganda on this point should be tested and exposed.</p>
                        <p>6. Another purpose of continuing suspension would be to drive rift
                            between Communist powers and between Hanoi and <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>. We have considerable reason to believe differences
                            exist that would come into play in a suspension, and tend to interpret
                            Hanoi's propaganda blast against pause on December 10 and 11 in sense
                            that Hanoi itself is concerned about this.<note n="3" xml:id="d255fn3">Reference is to a Hanoi radio broadcast in English on December 10
                                and a commentary in Hanoi's official paper, Nhan Dan, December 11,
                                that the potential U.S. bombing pause was a trick to mask
                                aggression, which deceived no one. (<gloss target="#t_FBIS1">FBIS</gloss>, North Vietnam, December 13, 1965)</note> To this

                            objections, you should note that Hanoi can hardly doubt our resolve in
                            face of our present and planned effort. Suspension does not suggest, nor
                            is there, slightest change in our negotiating position and objectives,

                        <p>P—That would be good. He ought to be talked to.</p>
                        <p>H—I think all of this ought to be done with Rusk's blessing.</p>
                        <p>J—I have told him this morning that I wanted you to do this. You report
                            directly to me like when you were down in Chile and some of these other
                            good trips you have taken. When you get back, you can talk to the Times
                            people, etc. I think that yesterday it has been four days now and there
                            hasn't been a bomb dropped on <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>. We
                            are not going to drop any until after the New Year if there is no
                            serious provocation. Keep your trip at low level as you can. Don't be
                            making us explain—you never do. I talked about it to Bob McNamara this
                            morning. Said you went down to Chile and nobody knew (you were there
                            until you got the job done). Bob McNamara is here. There is a plane
                            warming up. You go see Dean Rusk. You just get him the word just as soon
                            as you can… . There has been five days since there hasn't been a
                            bombing.</p>
                        <p>H—Which should I go to first?</p>
                        <p>J—You be the judge. I think you want to build Gronouski up a little and
                            pull him in on it. Tito, good. Hungarian Foreign Minister—they are the
                            first ones (notify). You ought to look at it—when I go before the
                            Committee for 25 billion dollars for special mission in <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>—and an extra 500,000 men. Then I can say
                            the day before Christmas no bombing, and then we sent Harriman to
                            Poland, to Yugoslavia, and we sent <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> and Rusk here and Wilson there. We have walked
                            the last mile.</p>
                        <p>H—Do you think we ought to go to Hungary first?</p>
                        <p>J—It seems to me that they are not any of them in State very strong for
                            this. You bear that in mind. But they weren't strong for Chile. You can
                            at least explain when you get back to Washington where you have been,
                            whom you have talked to, you have tried everything. And maybe you can
                            see the Russians later. We are seeing Dobrynin.</p>

                        <p>J—Don't you let Dean talk you out of it. You had a mighty good year. You
                            were a great comfort. My love to Marie.</p>
                        <p>H wished the President a Happy New Year and said no one deserved it

                        <p>202. Eyes only for Ambassador from Secretary.</p>
                        <p>1. President has decided that he wishes defer resumption of bombing for
                            several more days. We are most anxious that word of this action be
                            conveyed directly to <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, although we
                            are also naturally conveying message to key Communist governments that
                            are in touch with Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>2. Accordingly, you should convey aide-memoire in text given below in
                            some manner to <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> Ambassador Rangoon.
                            Moscow experience last May was that <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            Ambassador refused to meet with <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> or to accept written communication. However,
                            junior member of Embassy was able to hand written note to junior member
                            of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> Embassy staff so that effective
                            delivery was achieved even though <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            Embassy returned note on following day allegedly unopened. We would
                            suspect <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> Embassies may now have prior
                            instructions to reject any communication from us, and you will have to
                            explore carefully how to make first move in way that would ensure
                            physical delivery of note to some <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            representative, even if, as we expect, Ambassador himself refuses to
                            receive you. Use of reliable Burmese intermediary is not excluded if
                            purpose can only be achieved in this way. If necessary, you could
                            approach appropriate level RGUB to remind them of Burmese willingness,
                            expressed to U Thant apparently during 1964, that Rangoon would be
                            available as site for contacts between US and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. We leave method entirely to you, but action should be
                            taken soonest and in way that ensures effective delivery. Please give
                            full account of actions you take and of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> reactions.</p>

                        <p>“1. As you are no doubt aware, there has been no bombing in North
                            Viet-Nam since December 24 although some reconnaissance flights have
                            continued. No decision has been made regarding a resumption of bombings
                            and unless there is a major provocation we would hope that the present
                            stand-down, which is in its fifth day, could extend beyond New Year. If
                            your government will now reciprocate by making a serious contribution
                            toward peace, it would obviously have a favorable effect on the
                            possibility of further extending the suspension.</p>
                        <p>“2. I and other members of my Embassy staff stand available at any time
                            to receive any communication you may wish to address to me or to
                                us.”<note n="2" xml:id="d257fn2">In Paris, Paul Sturm was instructed
                                to inform <persName corresp="#p_MVBR1">Mai Van Bo</persName> of his

                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">December 23</hi>. The Secretary called in the Charge
                            in order to give him a message inquiring whether the Hungarian Foreign
                            Minister had received any information that would throw light on the
                            question the Secretary had asked Peter at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in October. (The Secretary's question had been, in
                            effect, what would happen on the other side if we were to stop
                            bombing.)</p>
                        <p>In the course of the conversation, the Secretary spelled out in some
                            detail 12 basic points concerning the US position. He asked that these
                                <pb n="723" xml:id="pg_723" facs="0755"/>points be brought to the

                            chose.</p>
                        <p>The Charge said that he would report the conversation urgently.<note n="2" xml:id="d258fn2">See <ref target="#d241">Document

                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">December 24</hi>. The Charge called the Secretary to
                            say that he would like to see him urgently. The Charge asked for
                            clarification of our intentions concerning a Christmas truce. The
                            Secretary responded that we had received no indication of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> attitude on our own 30-hour military
                            ceasefire. He stated emphatically that any ceasefire, of 12 or 30 hours,
                            could not be unilateral. He said that he might know more about our
                            precise military plans during the day. Finally, the Secretary said that
                            we remained interested in knowing what the other side would do if we
                            stopped shooting or bombing.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">December 25</hi>. The Secretary telephoned the
                            Charge during the evening to say that the outcome of the ceasefire
                            within South Viet-Nam depended on the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            attitude and actions. However, he went on to say that he wished the
                            Charge to know that we did not expect to conduct bombing attacks in
                            North Viet-Nam for “a day or two” after Christmas. He said that he would
                            be most interested in any message the Charge might produce on the basis
                            of this information.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">December 27</hi>. The Secretary called the Charge
                            early in the afternoon to ask if he had had any message. The Charge
                            responded in the negative, but later in the afternoon called again to
                            say that he now had instructions. Accordingly, the Secretary received
                            him at 6 p.m.</p>
                        <p>The Charge conveyed a very precisely phrased message from <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName>:</p>
                        <p>“Can the Secretary's messages be interpreted to mean that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is ready or willing to enter into
                            negotiations on ‘the platform presented by you’ with the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>?”</p>
                        <p>The Charge went on to say that the “platform” obviously referred to the
                            12 points summarized by the Secretary to the Charge on December 23.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary responded by making five points:</p>
                        <p>1. He referred to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s remarks at his July 28 press conference<note n="3" xml:id="d258fn3">See <ref target="#d97">Document
                                97</ref>.</note> to the effect that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> would not have difficulty being represented or having
                            their views presented, “if Hanoi decided it wished to cease
                            aggression.”</p>
                        <p>2. The US problem of peace lies with Hanoi, not the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>. US forces are in Viet-Nam only because
                            Hanoi has sent tens of thousands of men, including regular forces, into
                            South Viet-Nam. If Hanoi had not done this, US forces would not be
                            there. Thus, our problem is with Hanoi.</p>
                        <pb n="724" xml:id="pg_724" facs="0756"/>
                        <p>3. Our 12 points are a matter of public record. If the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> is seriously interested in these 12
                            points, they can tell us or Peter or anyone such as the Geneva
                            Co-Chairmen. We would be interested if <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> has any indication that the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> is thus interested.</p>
                        <p>4. There is no technical problem applicable to contact with the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>. Members of the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> have family ties and are well known in Saigon. The
                            Charge interjected to ask whether this meant they could talk to the US
                            or to South Viet-Nam in both directions. The Secretary responded by
                            going on to his fifth point below.</p>
                        <p>5. The USG cannot enter into negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>. The Secretary emphasized this two or
                            three times in the conversation. He pointed out that there were other
                            groups in South Viet-Nam—Buddhists, Catholics, Montagnards, sects, etc.,
                            who had their own leaders and would have to be considered. The local
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> were part of a population of 14
                            million. One could not negotiate with them simply because they happened
                            to have rifles.</p>
                        <p>At this, Charge grunted disagreement, and the Secretary remarked: “I
                            predicted your disagreement,” and the Charge responded: “You predicted
                            correctly.”</p>
                        <p>Having made these five basic points, the Secretary went on, “in
                            confidence,” to say that at times there seemed to be nuances of
                            difference between the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> and Hanoi,
                            between Hanoi and Peiping, and of course well known differences between
                            Moscow and Peiping. Under these circumstances, it was very hard to find
                            anyone with whom to make peace. The Secretary said he put this remark in
                            confidence because he did not wish to exaggerate, but that this was the
                            reason for the suggestion that he would be interested in any expression
                            of <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> views on the 12 points.</p>
                        <p>The Charge complained at this point that they had been given very little
                            time to get any response and had had no time to get out “to the
                            jungle.”</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said he did not connect <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName>'s message to the bombing. He could not say at that
                            moment when the bombing would be resumed. It could be at any time.
                            However, he wished to underscore that even the cessation of bombing for
                            these three days had shown that it was a point of flexibility on our
                            side, if there was any interest on the other side.</p>
                        <p>At this point the Charge asked if he might make a personal remark, and
                            asked rhetorically: “Do you think Peter speaks on his own?” (The obvious
                            intended implication was that <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> had been in touch with Hanoi or the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>, or both.) The Secretary responded that
                            if Peter had reported Hanoi moving in the direction of peace, that would
                            be very important. <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName>'s report
                            on the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> was also interesting, but he
                            repeated that he did not connect <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName>'s message with the bombing of the North. The
                            Secretary went on to say that we could stop the bombing but we still
                            wanted to know what Hanoi would then do—not a commitment <pb n="725" xml:id="pg_725" facs="0757"/>but at least an indication. He recalled
                            his own participation in the negotiations that terminated the Berlin
                            Blockade and started up in 1951 concerning Korea, and said that there
                            were ways for diplomats to find these things out privately. He went on
                            to say that our 12 points meant exactly what they said and were
                            reliable. If Hanoi thinks we are not in good faith, let them probe
                            us.</p>
                        <p>The Charge interjected that the present US response appeared to be that
                            we could not negotiate with the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>. The
                            Secretary said this was indeed the case. The Secretary said however that
                            we mean all we say, for example about not having bases or a military
                            presence in South Viet-Nam and that if Hanoi gets out, we will.</p>
                        <p>The Charge put on an act of discouragement at this point and asked how we
                            could find a solution. The Secretary responded that if Hanoi was
                            determined to absorb South Viet-Nam by force, there was bound to be
                            further war. The Charge then asked what would happen if free elections
                            led to Communist control of the South. The Secretary said this was a
                            matter for the people of South Viet-Nam. The Charge then backtracked a
                            bit with some remarks about how hard it was to find the will of the
                            people in any circumstances, and admitted under the Secretary's teasing
                            that he took a standard Communist view of elections.</p>
                        <p>The conversation then went back to what would happen if the bombing
                            continued to be suspended. The Charge again complained that he had had
                            no time to get “to the jungle.” He thought this was a pity, as this was
                            a very good psychological moment. Now, he regretted to say, he found our
                            response discouraging and was afraid the bombing would resume.
                            Nonetheless he would carefully report the Secretary's statement that our
                            action should at least be taken as an indication of our flexibility on
                            this point.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then noted that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> had
                            put on at least 20 incidents even during their own ceasefire period, and
                            then 60 more during ours. The Charge responded that he had been
                            surprised there hadn't been a major attack; the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> didn't have IBM machines to give orders.</p>
                        <p>The Charge then referred to the Secretary's call on Christmas evening.
                            The Secretary said that our informing the Hungarians of our intent was
                            part of our saying that we were interested in peace, but could not pay
                            the price of South Viet-Nam. If you looked at our 12 points, we had been
                            fair and constructive on every other element, but we were simply not
                            about to trade South Viet-Nam for peace. The Charge then reverted to
                            saying that that was all very well, but we still wouldn't talk with the
                                <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then asked, as a point of information, whether there was
                            now an <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> office in Budapest. The
                            Charge responded that one had just been installed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary brought the conversation to a close by saying that he did
                            appreciate <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName>'s interest.</p>
                        <pb n="726" xml:id="pg_726" facs="0758"/>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">December 28</hi>. The Secretary summoned the Charge
                            about noon to give him a simple statement that we were not proposing to
                            resume bombing for at least several more days. The Secretary's message
                            followed exactly the text used with the Soviets and Poles as well, and
                            is attached.</p>
                        <p>In response, the Charge gave the Secretary the following message from
                            Peter (subsequently phoned in absolutely correct form to Mr. Bundy). It
                            was as follows:</p>
                        <p>“I have got your newer message and your pressing questions. Every one of

                            studying all your proposals,' which the Charge explained orally to Mr.
                            Bundy meant that the proposals were being studied by 'someone other than
                                <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName>.’]<note n="4" xml:id="d258fn4">Brackets in the source text.</note>

                        <p>Washington, December 28, 1965.</p>
                        <p>1. As you are doubtless aware, there has been no bombing in North Viet
                            Nam since December 24th although some reconnaissance flights have
                            continued. I have been asked to tell you that no decision has been made
                            regarding a resumption of bombing and that this will depend upon
                            developments. We would hope that the present standdown, which is in its
                            fifth day, could extend at least through New Year's. We cannot make a
                            flat commitment as to timing because of the possibility of some
                            particularly outrageous action or some major new move by the other side.
                            If, on the other hand, the other side should reciprocate by making a
                            serious contribution toward peace, it would obviously have a favorable
                            effect on the possibility of extending the suspension.</p>
                        <p>2. Because of the interest and concern of your government about this
                            problem, this information is being passed to you for whatever use your
                            government may wish to make of it.</p>

                        <p>I made the following oral statement to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows the identical text of the statement that Rusk gave to
                                <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName>; see the attachment
                            to <ref target="#d258">Document 258</ref>.]</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he would, of
                            course, promptly inform his Government but he wished it understood that
                            he was not undertaking to pass this information to Hanoi. He asked if we
                            were taking any steps to inform Hanoi, to which I replied that we were
                            informing the Hungarian Government and possibly some other Governments
                            and assumed that the information would reach them. In any event, they
                            would be aware that the bombing had been suspended.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that, speaking
                            quite off the record, his Hungarian colleague had obtained the
                            impression from the Secretary that as of yesterday the Secretary had
                            thought that the bombing might be resumed any day, including possibly
                            today. He asked me if I could tell him for his own information whether
                            the Hungarian had misunderstood or whether something had happened
                            between yesterday and today.</p>
                        <p>I replied by drawing his attention to the fact that the President was in
                            Texas and said that my guess was that the Secretary was simply being
                            cautious in order not to mislead the Hungarian the other way.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked me what the words
                            “could extend beyond New Year's” meant. When I said I hesitated to make
                            any interpretation of these words as I wished to be very careful not to
                            mislead him, he said that he would assume that the stand-down would
                            probably go for a few days beyond New Year's. I said I thought this was
                            probably a reasonable interpretation.</p>

                        <p>Having noted your messages on the resumption of Rolling Thunder<note n="2" xml:id="d260fn2">See <ref target="#d245">Document 245</ref>
                                and <ref target="#d245fn3">footnote 3</ref> thereto.</note> and
                            understanding thoroughly the sound military reasons behind your
                            recommendations for a prompt resumption, it occurred to me that you
                            might be interested in getting more of the feeling at the Washington end
                            on this subject.</p>
                        <p>Since returning from Saigon last August, I have made nearly fifty
                            speaking or TV appearances about the country, an experience which has
                            opened my eyes to problems of the domestic front which I did not know
                            existed. Although there is a strong majority support for the
                            Administration's position on Viet-Nam, it is more the normal American
                            reaction to rally around the President in time of crisis than the result
                            of any deep conviction that our course of action is necessary and right.
                            There is still confusion over the basic issues in spite of the many
                            statements of our leaders and a subdued but real uneasiness that
                            important facts are being held back or concealed from the public.</p>
                        <p>One often expressed doubt is over the sincerity of our desire for a
                            negotiated settlement in Viet-Nam. This doubt has been fed by the false
                            rumors of rejected feelers which have received extended press treatment.
                            A recurrent allegation is that we deliberately create conditions under
                            which Hanoi could not be expected to respond to our offer of
                            unconditional discussions.</p>
                        <p>Most of these critics make common cause in urging a prolonged bombing
                            pause to give Hanoi a chance to respond. I have always opposed such a
                            pause for a variety of reasons but have always feared that pressures for
                            one might sometime get out of hand. Hence, once the Christmas cease-fire
                            became a fact, I was inclined to take the position that, if a bombing
                            pause were ever to be undertaken, now is the time to do it. It can be
                            done in a low-key way without elaborate comment or explanation and
                            terminated without fanfare after running for a short, unspecified
                            period. If such an action would expose once and for all the futility of
                            letting up the pressures on the enemy, it would be a worthwhile exercise
                            despite the military disadvantages which you see so clearly.</p>
                        <pb n="729" xml:id="pg_729" facs="0761"/>
                        <p>The overall thought which I want to convey is that there is justified
                            concern over the long-term durability of our home front. Everything
                            depends on the ability of the President to keep the country aligned
                            behind his Viet-Nam policy in spite of mounting casualties, a vast
                            budget increase and the seeming endlessness of the conflict. If the
                            suspension of Rolling Thunder to New Year's or some such time will
                            materially help him in this task, I have no personal hesitation in
                            advising him to do so. After this test period is over, I would hope that
                            Rolling Thunder would be resumed with a heightened intensity which,
                            after the lull, would be all the more unpleasant for Hanoi.</p>

                            <item>Conversation with the Secretary following the President's
                                telephone call to me<note n="2" xml:id="d261fn2">See <ref target="#d256">Document 256</ref>.</note> to travel to

                        </list>
                        <p>The Secretary took a negative view. I told him the President told me
                            “Don't let Dean talk you out of it.” He proposed my going to Paris to
                            see Chauvel.<note n="3" xml:id="d261fn3">See <ref target="#d236fn6">footnote 6, Document 236</ref>.</note> Also to Rome and Iran. I
                            said I wasn't going to Iran—that would not achieve the President's
                            purposes, and there was also no use my trying to twist people's arms to
                            increase aid to Viet-Nam during the bomb pause; and anyway the President
                            wanted me to be able to testify when I got back that he had sent me to
                            go the last mile in trying to come to a settlement.</p>
                        <p>He seems opposed to my seeing Bo. He says we are making a contact. He
                            didn't tell me who. He said he would talk to the President this
                            afternoon. I said the President wanted me to go today. That seemed to
                                <pb n="730" xml:id="pg_730" facs="0762"/>take him aback. I said it
                            wasn't much time before the end of the year and the President wants the
                            time to be used.</p>
                        <p>He is afraid talking to the Hungarians would put them on the spot and be
                            counterproductive. I asked him why, because I understood they had
                            indicated that we hadn't taken their contact sufficiently seriously.</p>
                        <p>He said “You and Tommy <note n="4" xml:id="d261fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Llewellyn E.
                                Thompson</persName>.</note> talk it over some more.” Tommy suggested
                            I talk to Alex to see whether the South Vietnamese wouldn't be terribly
                            upset. I said “Tommy, this is the President of the United States, not
                            South Viet-Nam, whom you are working for. South Viet-Nam we can protect
                            as much as possible, but the President has the job of convincing
                            Congress he has made the last effort. Anyway, Alex is basically opposed
                            to talks.” He suggested going to Paris, Rome, Yugoslavia, which could be
                            done without any harm. I said that wouldn't equip me to testify that we
                            had run down every lead.</p>

                            a telegram to Byroade in Rangoon for him to get in touch with the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> Ambassador and give him an

                        <p>Mc asked <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> if he thought it
                            would be wise for <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> to go to
                            see Wilson. B said he thought Wilson would appreciate a quiet
                            Presidential letter more than he would someone coming over. B thought
                            the same thing <pb n="731" xml:id="pg_731" facs="0763"/>could be done in
                            Ottawa. B told Mc that <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>
                            was going to Warsaw tonight. B said he and Rusk agreed that the
                            Hungarians should work their own way out re <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>. They have given indications they are trying to
                            make a serious effort here. The Charge came back today with a lot of
                            questions. B said we proposed, if approved by the President, that
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> go to Budapest only
                            if invited by the Hungarians. After spending a few days in Warsaw
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">H[arriman]</persName> could go to
                            Paris.</p>
                        <p>B told Mc that <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> was on his
                            way to N.Y. and presumably would see U Thant tonight; then he would fly
                            to see the Pope; and return home.</p>
                        <p>Mc said he thought this was what had been discussed earlier today. Mc
                            thought it would be desirable for H to see Tito if he could. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he thought the problem was
                            that Tito is so unpopular with the rest of the Bloc.</p>
                        <p>Mc said one of the things we should get are views of other people. How do
                            they see this shaping up in the future. Mc said he realizes as well as
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> that it is unlikely that
                            this is all going to end with unconditional surrender by <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>. They both agreed there had to be face
                            savers.</p>
                        <p>McN said if we send these people out we cannot end this pause New Year's
                            Eve. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> agreed and said if it
                            did not run until at least the end of next week we would be charged with
                            bad faith. Mc said he had told the Pres this last night and he thought
                            he was prepared to go beyond the first if we get anything at all. Mc
                            said he had sent a telegram to <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>,<note n="4" xml:id="d262fn4">Telegram

                        <p>Mc said we were going to start our Blue Tree Reconnaissance again. We are
                            not to return fire unless trying to recover a pilot who has been shot
                            down and we are trying to rescue.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> informed Mc of Moscow's

                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> informed the Pres that he
                            had sent him a long memorandum describing exactly what we were doing and
                            proposing including some draft letters.<note n="2" xml:id="d263fn2">Dated December 28. (Department of State, Central Files, POL 27 VIET

                        </p>
                        <p>Pres asked <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> to give him the
                            gist of what was being transmitted. President told <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> he wanted him here because he was
                            inspiring, stimulating and “shoving” just as he had on two or three
                            other occasions in this field. Pres said even if all this comes to
                            naught he would feel better. He said he had to survive this thing. He
                            has 3 more years to go and he said he wanted <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> sitting at the bridge calling the signals and he is
                            not to let “them” talk him out of “it”. Pres told <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> to get his Dutch toes in concrete
                            and is to say “this is what the man (the Pres) wants and I am here to
                            shove.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> told the Pres that <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> left tonight at 8:00 and while
                            enroute we are expecting clearance from the Polish Govt so he will go
                            straight to Warsaw and will plan to spend a couple of days with the
                            Poles. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said we had asked the
                            Hungarian Govt whether they would like to have H come there. We have had
                            an indication from the Charge that the Govt wants to be active in this.
                            They have asked clarification of 2 or 3 of the things we gave them and
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> the Charge (Hungarian) had
                            been in touch with him regularly. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said we think something significant might come from
                            the Hungarian efforts. However, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said, we don't want to send <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> there unless they want him but
                            we do want to have him available and at their option so he can be
                            helpful to them. We don't want to take a chance of <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s coming in and having them
                            close-up by saying he has embarrassed them by coming.</p>
                        <p>Pres said this is all right, however, he would not worry about the
                            Hungarians. Pres thinks <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>
                            should go to Hungary in any event. He said we could always find reasons
                            for his not going. Pres said he would not hesitate to take the
                            responsibility.</p>
                        <p>Re the Yugoslavs <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said we had
                            not been able to set it up with Tito. He has left Brioni but we would
                            keep working on it.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he thought we would
                            have an answer from the Hungarians tomorrow and in the meantime H would
                            go on to Warsaw and we would not lose any time. H will try to get the
                            Polish govt to start moving.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said we had sent an
                            Aide-Memoire to Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> in
                            Rangoon to deliver to the <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> Consul
                            General there.<note n="3" xml:id="d263fn3">See <ref target="#d257">Document 257</ref>.</note> This was our appraisal of the best
                            fellow to deal with on a fast basis and this is the fellow U Thant would
                            have used last fall. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he
                            was going to have <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> tell
                                <persName corresp="#p_TU1">Thant</persName> tonight what we were
                            doing so he will know what we are talking about. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> explained this was a formal way we
                            could deal with the Govt and we would have an absolute record made. It
                            should be delivered tomorrow as early as possible.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> should be leaving for
                            Rome tonight at 2:00 <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said.
                            However, there is one problem, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> told the Pres. Fanfani tendered his resignation
                            today to Moro over the La Pira incident<note n="4" xml:id="d263fn4">Italian law professer and ex-Mayor of Florence Giorgio La Pira went
                                to Hanoi for discussions with <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                                officials. He then transmitted a peace feeler from the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> through Italian Foreign Minister
                                    <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>; see <ref target="#d205">Documents 205</ref> and <ref target="#d207">207</ref>. When La
                                Pira's identity was leaked by the Italian press and his connection
                                to Hanoi revealed, the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                                disassociated itself from the peace feeler.</note> and apparently it
                            appears that the Italian Govt is in a shakey position. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he was concerned that since
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> was associated with
                            Fanfani in the La Pira incident that the Italian press would say we are
                            interfering in domestic politics. The Pres interrupted to say he wanted
                            a Jew seeing the Pope. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said
                            the problem was that since <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> was a high official in the Govt he would have
                            to see the Italian officials. Pres said this had nothing to do with it.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> is to call on the
                            Pope and get right on to Paris.</p>
                        <p>Pres said <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> is to tell the
                            Pope we appreciate what he said about the Christmas truce and we are
                            responding to what he said about a truce on New Years and we want him to
                            get busy and get some action of us and get right into Hanoi. Pres said
                            what he liked best was a Jew talking to a Catholic. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said we would send <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> on but he wanted to alert the
                            Pres to the difficulties that might arise. Pres said <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> should say he could not
                            discuss the La Pira incident at all. It is an internal matter.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said we were trying to
                            get the letters out tonight. Pres said he would look at them the minute
                            they reach the Ranch.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> read the Wilson letter and
                            the President approved. He suggested that <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> add that he is restricting this information to a
                            very few and he would hope that Wilson, etc. would do the same.</p>
                        <p>Pres also said he preferred something other than the statement “the first
                            of the year”. He suggested “for a more extended period”, or “for many
                            days”. Pres said he did not want to be committed. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he would fix this.</p>
                        <p>Pres said he thought someone should talk to Pearson. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he could go up. Pres said he
                            would rather <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> stay here. Pres
                            thought MacBundy could perhaps meet Pearson in Philadelphia or go to
                            Ottawa.</p>
                        <p>Pres said <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> should be sure to
                            have a letter from him to the Pope for <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> to deliver. It should thank him for the
                            Christmas truce and the New Year's truce so the Pope would feel we were
                            complying. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he would do
                            this.</p>
                        <p>Pres said he was depending on <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                            as his lawyer and his devil's advocate. Pres said <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> was not to let “them” talk him out
                            of anything. Pres said <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                            should stay right on it until we are sure we have bled it for all it is

                        </p>
                        <p>A. Your para 8. No one will applaud more than I your efforts to secure
                            support from the homefront. With homefront support we cannot fail.
                            Without, we cannot win.</p>
                        <p>B. Your para 5 statement that “assuring South Viet-Nam without major
                            bloodshed” is obviously of capital importance in bringing about
                            steadfast homefront support. For this reason, I urge that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> in its own mind be clear as to what it
                            regards as a satisfactory outcome of this war since some outcomes may
                            require more bloodshed than others.</p>
                        <pb n="735" xml:id="pg_735" facs="0767"/>
                        <p>C. Let me think aloud purely for illustrative purposes. It is obvious
                            that if we define a satisfactory outcome as 1.) seeking out and utterly
                            destroying the North Vietnamese military main forces and potential, or
                            2.) seizing the Laos panhandle and the valley of the Mekong, or 3.) as
                            meaning a state of affairs in which elections free from any intimidation
                            can be held in every one of the 2, 658 villages in all 43 provinces, we
                            may be taking on jobs which cannot be done without major bloodshed.</p>
                        <p>D. If, on the other hand, we define “satisfactory outcome” as the U.S.
                            Mission tried to do it in our 1377,<note n="3" xml:id="d264fn3">
                                <ref target="#d176">Document 176</ref>.</note> this is, hold the
                            delta and the coastal plain, the provincial capitals and the roads, push
                            out durably, even though slowly, within South Viet-Nam through the kind
                            of pacification-countryside rebuilding which Lansdale is promoting and
                            ward off the North Vietnamese aggression so as to make possible the
                            achievement of the above, perhaps we could hold on for a long time
                            without “major bloodshed”. I realize that even this may cause bloodshed
                            too.</p>
                        <p>E. Your para 4. There is no doubt of the intense interest which public
                            opinion polls must hold for all of us in government, and I do not
                            question the authenticity of the Harris Poll. It does, however, point up
                            the need for us who are in the work of foreign relations to educate one
                                [<hi rend="italic">our</hi>?] public at least in two respects:</p>
                        <p>First, that a cease fire, unaccompanied by a verified withdrawal of
                            forces in effect confirms the Viet Cong aggressors in all the places
                            where they are now. It also denies the sovereignty of the Government of
                            Viet-Nam. In a very real sense, therefore, it gives the Viet Cong the
                            victory before negotiations have been started. In fact, had our
                            Christmas truce offer been accepted, we might have been in an extremely
                            critical situation for the above reason. Therefore, we should first
                            consider educating public opinion about what constitutes an honest and a
                            dishonest cease fire, and it was in that connection that I suggested
                            that a television documentary be made based on Admiral Joy's book about
                            negotiations at Panmunjom.<note n="4" xml:id="d264fn4">See <ref target="#d237fn4">footnote 4, Document 237</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, the public needs to be educated on the fact that Hanoi and
                            Peking do not react like Americans, and that over-eagerness on our part
                            is interpreted by them as a sign of weakness. Therefore the 72 per cent
                            who favor “renewed effort for a cease fire” in the belief that it would
                            promote the chance of peace are actually defeating their own purpose and
                            are hardening the resolve of the enemy.</p>
                        <p>I believe that sooner or later we are going to have to make these things
                            very clear, and, of course, I will do everything I can to help.</p>
                        <pb n="736" xml:id="pg_736" facs="0768"/>
                        <p>F. I am also interested in your paragraph 6 about differences existing
                            between the Viet Cong and Hanoi. As my conversations with Palmas have
                            shown, we suspect this also.</p>

                                under discussion here. (Department of State, Central Files, POL
                                27-14 VIET)</note> I called upon <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            Consul General at 3 p.m. today. Was received initially by Lam Bao who
                            remained as interpreter during discussion. I took Leo Reddy, junior
                            officer of Political Section who speaks French, in hopes he might be
                            useful if further liaison develops.</p>
                        <p>Vu Huu Binh then received me with slight smile and ready handshake. I
                            told him I was grateful for opportunity to see him personally as my
                            government wished me to convey message directly to him for transmittal
                            to his government. I then handed him the aide-memoire. He and his
                            interpreter studied document together with interpreter translating parts
                            thereof into Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>After studying document Vu Huu Binh said he would transmit it to his
                            government. At this point we were served with beer (I believe South
                            Vietnamese). I thanked him and told him I planned to keep my visit to
                            him and the subject thereof quite confidential. I had come in official
                            U.S. Embassy car but not my own because it was conspicuous. He said that
                            on his part he would also keep matter confidential.</p>
                        <p>I told him my instructions had reached me just as I was departing for the
                            airport to go to Sandoway for a few days rest and to join my family who
                            were already there. I wanted him to know that I was cancelling my
                            vacation and would be available in Rangoon anytime of day or night if he
                            should wish to see me. Also, a member of my staff could always be
                            available <pb n="737" xml:id="pg_737" facs="0769"/>if he wished to relay
                            a message. I told him I cared nothing about protocol niceties and we
                            could meet quite secretly if he so desired.</p>
                        <p>Vu Huu Binh said he could tell me nothing except that he would transmit
                            message to his government. I thanked him again for receiving me and he
                            thanked me for coming. He accompanied me to car and politely shook
                            hands. Discussion lasted about eight minutes.</p>
                        <p>Although conversation was interpreted, it was obvious Vu Huu Binh
                            understood my remarks. Moreover, by his acceptance of formal
                            communication I believe we got our message across to <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>1060. For the President and Secretary from <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>.</p>
                        <p>1. Ambassador and I have just concluded one hour and a quarter talk with
                                <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_WJ1">Winiewicz</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName> and Wierna.</p>
                        <p>2. I outlined President's position regarding pause in bombing as a step
                            towards peace with hope Hanoi would respond. We gave <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> the Secretary's 14 points as
                            U.S. attitude towards peace in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName>, after some argument
                            that we were giving ultimatum to Hanoi by threat of resuming bombing
                            with possible escalation, finally accepted my contention that pause was
                            in fact giving Hanoi an opportunity for peaceful settlement if she would
                            seize it and respond with a return indication.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> suggested adjournment
                            for lunch. He said our talk had resulted in an understanding of each
                            other's position and that this afternoon he wants to discuss the kind of
                            message he might convey to Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>5. Ambassador feels my visit and our discussion have been useful as
                                <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> is obviously gratified

                        <p>1066. For the President and Secretary from <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>. We lunched with <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> and same group of his associates. After some
                            informal discussion on changes in Soviet leadership and Sino-Soviet
                            dispute, <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> focused
                            discussion on what he might transmit to Hanoi. He asked for explanations
                            of several matters particularly President's statement on <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> representation at conference. As he
                            tried to read into it acceptance on our part of <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> as full members conference I firmly stated our position
                            that only governments could be members but Front could be fully heard.
                            Argument over this lasted some time, but <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> finally accepted fact that we were only dealing
                            at the moment with the possibility of a favorable reaction by Hanoi to
                            the President's pause in bombing. Question of how further talks could
                            take place was left open, necessarily through Geneva type
                            conference.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> was eventually satisfied
                            on the points he had raised and said he would try to transmit US
                            position faithfully to Hanoi for its consideration which might take some
                            time. The Ambassador and I underlined pressures on the President which
                            required a prompt reaction from Hanoi. We emphasized not only military
                            considerations but early date of decision on State of Union message and
                            budget. Discussion ended on most cordial note. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> stated simply and with dignity
                            that he would do what he could and pointed out how important ending of
                            Vietnam war was to world stability.</p>
                        <p>We agreed to give press brief statement that I had come to Warsaw to talk
                            with Polish Government about Vietnam in its capacity as member <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and had discussion with <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName>, etc. Statement is now being

                            met by saying simply that their governments have been informed.
                            Naturally, if representatives indicate they have received the word, you
                            may elicit comment for whatever use it may be.</p>

                            response. Our supposition is that one or more may already have been in
                            touch with Hanoi, and Hungarians came back to us even over Christmas

                            pressure of time and did not therefore go into certain details.
                            Following are some additions.</p>
                        <p>1. No one is under any illusion here about our elementary choices if
                            Hanoi and Peiping continue to push into Southeast Asia by force. We can
                                <pb n="741" xml:id="pg_741" facs="0773"/>either get out of their way
                            and let them have it or we can meet them. We have decided to meet them.
                            When I spoke of “securing South Viet-Nam without major bloodshed” I was
                            referring to the contingency that the other side may look down the road
                            ahead and decide that it is too costly or too dangerous for them to
                            persist. This has happened with the Greek guerrillas, the Berlin
                            blockade, Korea and the Cuban missile crisis. I realize important
                            differences of attitude publicly expressed by Peiping but thus far
                            (fingers crossed) Peiping has been much more cautious in its actions
                            than it has been in its words. My remark was addressed to giving the
                            other side every chance to pull back.</p>
                        <p>2. I personally do not see any “satisfactory outcome” which involves
                            giving Hanoi and their Viet Cong puppets the fruits of their aggression
                            by force in South Viet-Nam. A deal was made in 1954 and 1962. Once again
                            the communist world is saying what is ours is ours and what is yours
                            must be talked about and divided up further. I feel we should insist
                            upon the 1954 and 1962 agreements. If the other side persists in
                            attempting to destroy those agreements by force, then I fear there shall
                            be bloodshed.</p>
                        <p>3. I agree with you fully that there is a fundamental difference between
                            an honest and a dishonest cease-fire. From an operational point of view
                            the most important point would be a pulling apart of North Viet-Nam and
                            South Viet-Nam militarily. That would mean stopping infiltration, return
                            of northern infiltrators and comparable actions on our side. This is
                            feasible although verification would present some difficulties. We do
                            not have in mind a cease-fire within South Viet-Nam itself which would
                            deny the authority of the Government of South Viet-Nam in any part of
                            the country. A long-term internal cease-fire could only be based upon a
                            cessation of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> aggression and
                            acceptance by the Viet Cong of the idea that they must lay down arms and
                            take their chances in peaceful political processes. It may be that
                            public opinion needs more education on this subject. We have not
                            undertaken it in any significant way because we have not even reached
                            the point where Hanoi is willing to stop its aggression.</p>
                        <p>4. Your point that Hanoi and Peiping may interpret interest in peace as
                            weakness is a good one and this has been much in our minds. We have
                            talked about this frankly with Eastern European governments. If there is
                            any such misunderstanding, it will be dramatically corrected when the
                            President asks the Congress in January for $25 billion for Viet-Nam for
                            the next eighteen months. You should know personally that we have made
                            it very clear to those in touch with the other side that Hanoi is up
                            against a moment of truth. If they do not now move towards peace, they
                            must face the most disagreeable possible consequences.</p>
                        <pb n="742" xml:id="pg_742" facs="0774"/>
                        <p>5. As you may know, the Vatican is concerning itself very actively with
                            Viet-Nam. They have not revealed to us fully what they are doing but our
                            impression is that they are very busy. This makes it quite important
                            that Archbishop Palmas fully understand that if there is any delay or
                            reluctance in connection with his conversations with you, these are to
                            be bound on the other side and not on our side. If you have not done so
                            in the last ten days, I would suggest you merely inquire of him whether
                            he has anything further pursuant to earlier conversations.</p>
                        <p>6. I am sending in a separate telegram a listing of points already made
                            public by the United States on various occasions having to do with the
                            basis for peace in Viet-Nam.<note n="4" xml:id="d269fn4">Reference is to
                                circular telegram 1243, December 30, which repeated the text of <ref target="#d247">Document 247</ref>, to all diplomatic posts and
                                Hong Kong. (Department of State, Central Files, POL 27 VIET
                                S)</note> I find that when these are drawn together most people,
                            including foreign diplomats as well as newsmen, are surprised. Their
                            surprise comes from their lack of diligence in doing their homework. But
                            under Pinta restrictions, I should tell you that the Hungarian Foreign
                            Minister asked me the other day whether the United States would be
                            prepared to negotiate with the National Liberation Front on the basis of
                            “this platform”. I replied that the Government of the United States
                            cannot negotiate with the Liberation Front since they are only one
                            element in a population of fourteen million and the views of Buddhists,
                            Catholics and other sects and others must be taken into account. I told
                            him I would be interested if he himself learned that the Liberation
                            Front was interested in the points which we have made public.<note n="5" xml:id="d269fn5">See <ref target="#d258">Document 258</ref>.</note>
                            Thus far no reply. I cannot overemphasize the importance of any
                            substantial defection from the Liberation Front away from Hanoi. If this
                            momentum should begin to roll, the other side's position would, in my
                            judgment, deteriorate very fast.</p>
                        <p>7. I need not repeat to you how grateful the President and I are for the
                            job you are doing. I am deeply convinced that the American people will
                            do what has to be done in meeting their commitments if they can do so in
                            good conscience and with a clear understanding that all honorable and
                            peaceful avenues have been closed by the aggressor.</p>

                        <p>1. I have asked the boys, on the basis of the bombing pause and press
                            reports of some kind of US contact with the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, to think about a number of the possibilities raised if
                            these stories are true. The results, which I attach, are:<note n="2" xml:id="d270fn2">All of the tabs are attached but none is

                        <p>(a) A paper outlining current Soviet tactics on Vietnam and how these
                            relate to Moscow's recent maneuvers against China; it concludes that
                            Shelepin in Hanoi will push hard the case for more reliance on diplomacy
                            and politics, less on military means. (Tab A)</p>
                        <p>(b) A paper thinking about China's attitude toward negotiations and
                            concluding that Peiping will threaten big difficulties whenever it
                            senses a weakening of Hanoi's resolve to continue fighting. (Tab B)</p>
                        <p>(c) A paper on South Vietnamese attitudes toward negotiations, which
                            concludes that they are largely negative but not insurmountably so. This
                            one was promised to the Director some time ago and has been approved by
                            the Board of National Estimates. (Tab C)</p>
                        <p>2. None of these deal with the central question of how Hanoi itself now
                            views its options. Some in this town may be better informed than we on
                            this one; perhaps we'll get some evidence soon.</p>
                        <p>3. I think you will find all of these papers interesting and hopefully a
                            contribution to your thinking. At least the first two (A and B above)
                            were written with this principally in mind and we do not recommend any
                            further circulation. In a few days we may all know enough more to
                            warrant review, revision, and circulation to a wider audience.</p>

                        <p>1. I arrived in Rome at 1600 and shortly thereafter at 1800 had an
                            hour-long private audience with Pope Paul VI. His interpreter Mons.
                            Cronin, an American priest, was only other person present. I handed His
                            Holiness letter from the President<note n="2" xml:id="d271fn2">Transmitted to Rome in telegram 1363, December 29. (Ibid.)</note>
                            which he read with great care. He immediately expressed his appreciation
                            for what he termed a very sincere and prompt response to his appeal for
                            a Christmas truce and to mankind's anxiety for concrete steps working
                            toward permanent peace in Vietnam. He said he would like me to assure
                            the President that he does not want to disturb in any way the American
                            situation in Vietnam but rather to be of help in the direction of a fair
                            and honorable settlement. His Holiness said that all his efforts would
                            be directed to this end, which he was confident the President shared. He
                            enquired about the President's health and I assured him the President
                            was in fine fettle.</p>
                        <p>2. His Holiness said he recalled with great satisfaction his private
                            conversation with the President during his visit to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in October and said there too he was
                            impressed with the President's sincerity and devotion to peace, now
                            reaffirmed by this communication. I then enquired whether he had
                            received any specific replies to his Christmas appeal. In answering he
                            handed me a copy of Osservatore Romano of Dec 27 which contains full
                            text of his message and in his own hand underlined text of appeal on
                            Vietnam. I understand this text has already been forwarded to
                            Washington. The Pope then went on to say that he had received replies
                            from <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> and from the
                            Govt of South Vietnam. He termed the <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi
                                Minh</persName> reply harsh and distressing. The text (in French) of
                            this reply is being sent by separate telegram.<note n="3" xml:id="d271fn3">Not found.</note> He apparently had received the
                            reply from South Vietnam only this morning and therefore had no extra
                            copies. He showed me the text which he termed, and I agreed, to be quite
                            affirmative. He directed Mons. Cronin to make this reply available to us
                            shortly and it will be forwarded as soon as received.<note n="4" xml:id="d271fn4">The text of this December 27 message is in telegram
                                1657 from Rome, December 30. (Department of State, Central Files,
                                POL 27 VIET S)</note> His Holiness then said he intended,
                            notwithstanding the harsh nature of <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi
                                Minh</persName>'s <pb n="745" xml:id="pg_745" facs="0777"/>reply, to
                            pursue the matter further. To this end he was planning to send to
                            Vietnam Mons. Rodhain, a French priest who is head of Caritas, a
                            charitable organization of the Church. He said Mons. Rodhain's purpose
                            would be charitable in nature but that he would also be vested with
                            instructions from the Pope to explore avenues of a peaceful settlement.
                            The Holy Father emphasized that Mons. Rodhain is a man of great
                            discretion and enjoyed his complete confidence. Plan would be for Mons.
                            Rodhain to go Hanoi as well as Saigon and the Pope indicated that
                            enquiries had been made to Hanoi as to whether Rodhain would be received
                            there. The proposal is to send him promptly.</p>
                        <p>3. The Pope then enquired as to our govt's views on the situation in
                            Vietnam. I reviewed the various steps which President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and his administration have
                            taken to transfer this conflict from the battlefield to the bargaining
                            table and stressed that the latest move—the bombing pause—was further
                            evidence of the US Govt's desire to seek peace in this troubled area.
                            The Pope then specifically enquired whether the Geneva Agreement of 1954
                            was considered by the US Govt a cornerstone of a possible peace
                            settlement. I replied that the President on several occasions, the
                            Secretary, the Under Secretary, and I at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had repeatedly confirmed that we would be willing to
                            negotiate on the basis of the Geneva Accords, at Geneva or at any other
                            appropriate forum. I explained that we did not agree with Hanoi's
                            interpretation of the Geneva Accords; particularly their point—one of
                            the four—that the Government of South Vietnam had to be reconstituted
                            along the lines of the program of the National Liberation Front. I
                            pointed out that this nowhere appeared in the Geneva agreement and that
                            postwar experience had shown that governments reconstituted by Communist
                            movements had frustrated rather than forwarded genuine
                            self-determination by the people involved. I recalled that Poland, among
                            other countries, was a case in point. His Holiness nodded in agreement
                            at this stage.</p>
                        <p>4. I conveyed the content of the aide-memoire cabled to Rangoon (Dept's
                            202 to Rangoon)<note n="5" xml:id="d271fn5">
                                <ref target="#d257">Document 257</ref>.</note> to be communicated by
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> to the North
                            Vietnamese Ambassador there. His Holiness was much impressed by the
                            forward step taken in this aide-memoire and again repeated that this was
                            great evidence of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s sincere desire for peace and willingness to
                            take long steps forward toward achieving it. His Holiness then turned to
                            another aspect of the problem. He said he wanted the President to know
                            that his own efforts stood apart from any initiatives by La Pira. He
                            esteemed La Pira as a good person but the Pope was pursuing his efforts
                            in his own way and through his own channels. In this connection the Pope
                            mentioned Archbishop Palmas, Apostolic Delegate to Vietnam and Cambodia.
                            The Archbishop, while <pb n="746" xml:id="pg_746" facs="0778"/>concerned
                            primarily with refugees and religious matters, was also being employed
                            by the Pope to help in the political situation. I interjected to express
                            our grave concern at the sanctuary being afforded the North Vietnamese
                            in Cambodia and indicated that this situation was most troublesome,
                            particularly in light of Prince Sihanouk's failure to take effective
                            action to prevent his territory from being used for purposes of
                            aggression by Hanoi. I also reminded the Holy Father that Sihanouk had
                            avoided resumption of the Geneva conference on Cambodia which,
                            hopefully, might have led to discussions on Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>5. At this point I conveyed the greetings of Secretary General U Thant
                            which U Thant had asked me to express when I met with him last night.
                            The Pope expressed great regard for U Thant as a man of peace and said
                            that before issuing his Christmas appeal he had in general terms
                            obtained U Thant's concurrence that such an appeal would be desirable.
                            The Pope showed great interest in the fact that the President had
                            conveyed messages concerning the bombing pause to Moscow, Budapest and
                            Warsaw, as well as to a number of our allies. He enquired whether we had
                            communicated with Peiping. I replied that I did not know, but doubted
                            that we had, in the belief that Peiping would not accept a direct
                            approach. I pointed out, however, that undoubtedly Peiping would have
                            knowledge of this development through a Communist source. The Pope
                            indicated indirectly that he shared the belief that the Soviets would be
                            more inclined to urge a favorable response than the Red Chinese.</p>
                        <p>6. Finally His Holiness indicated that after consultation with his
                            Secretary of State and other advisors he would prepare a written reply
                            to the President's letter, hopefully in time for delivery before my
                            planned departure tomorrow evening. It will be cabled when
                                received.<note n="6" xml:id="d271fn6">The text was transmitted in

                        </p>
                        <p>7. Although His Holiness was warm, affable and gracious to me, recalling
                            our exchanges when I was part of the President's party in New York on
                            the occasion of his <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> visit, and also
                            when he received me in private audience in the summer of 1964, his
                            general demeanor was one of grave concern about the Vietnam
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>8. The Pope asked whether the President's letter could be made public. I
                            said that this was in his discretion but that I would not do so. With
                            his approval I prepared following press statement to be made tonight by
                            Embassy spokesman.</p>
                        <p>9. “The Honorable <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Arthur J.
                                Goldberg</persName>, US Ambassador to the United Nations, arrived in

                        <pb n="747" xml:id="pg_747" facs="0779"/>
                        <p>10. “The President sent Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> on a special mission to convey to His Holiness
                            Pope Paul VI the President's gratitude for the Holy Father's message and
                            inspiration which were so helpful in helping to bring about a Christmas
                            truce in Vietnam. The President also asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> to thank His Holiness for the
                            continuous efforts he is making in furtherance of peace in Southeast
                            Asia. The President's gratitude, on behalf of the American people, is,
                            in his view, shared by all mankind.”</p>
                        <p>11. The Pope stated that upon inquiries from the press he would make a
                            statement of similar import. It was my latest impression that he would
                            not publicize the text of the President's letter but would refer to it
                            in favorable terms.</p>
                        <p>12. Following the audience I called upon Secretary of State Cicognani and
                            spent approximately one half hour reviewing in briefer terms my
                            conversation with His Holiness. The Sec of State indicated sympathy with
                            the American point of view on Vietnam, but added that perhaps the best
                            way towards a peaceful solution was the Pope's more evenhanded
                            approach.</p>
                        <p>13. Prime Minister Moro is out of Rome but is returning tomorrow and has
                            asked to see me about 7:00 p.m. tomorrow evening. He requested that the
                            President's letter<note n="7" xml:id="d271fn7">The text was transmitted
                                in telegram 1632 to Rome, December 29. (Ibid., POL 27 VIET S)</note>
                            be sent to him through Pompei, his diplomatic advisor. This has been
                            done. Pompei indicated he would make a copy of the letter to the Prime
                            Minister available to President Saragat.</p>

                                1075, December 28, the Embassy in Bangkok was instructed to inform
                                the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the decision on and
                                purpose of the suspension of the bombing of North Vietnam. (Ibid.,
                                Central Files, POL 27 VIET S)</note>

                        <pb n="748" xml:id="pg_748" facs="0780"/>
                        <p>1. In absence of Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, I conveyed
                            requested information to Acting FonMin Pote Sarasin as directed in para
                            4 reftel.</p>
                        <p>2. After a long pause Pote asked that I convey to the Secretary his
                            understanding of the action taken. He said that as an Asian, thinking as
                            an Asian, he thought it was a mistake. It would be interpreted in Asia
                            as a sign of weakness and indecision and would reinforce Hanoi
                            determination to carry on until American public opinion forced
                            withdrawal. Consequently, he thought it would prolong war rather than
                            shorten it and cost more American casualties rather than fewer.</p>
                        <p>3. In referring to third purpose as outlined in para 4-D reftel, Pote
                            doubted effect on third countries would be as beneficial as we might
                            have thought. He said it would not help to convince the already
                            convinced and as for the others we would always get the argument that if
                            the pause had been extended for “another day, another week, another
                            month,” it might have been successful.</p>
                        <p>4. In response to my direct inquiry he said that he personally had no
                            doubt whatever as to American firmness.</p>
                        <p>5. I later conveyed the same information to Deputy Prime Minister Praphat
                            who had much the same reaction as Pote. He added reporting of comment
                            which Tun Razak, Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia, attributed to Ne
                            Win, who had suggested closer consultations between Burmese, Thai, and
                            Malaysians for their own protection when Americans pull out. He said he
                            had told Tun Razak he did not expect Americans to leave until the safety
                            of Southeast Asia was assured. He also added that every day the pause
                            continued, however, the more question there would be of American
                            intentions and this, he added, was a dangerous attitude to let build up
                            for too long a time.<note n="3" xml:id="d272fn3">In telegram 1096 to
                                Bangkok, December 30, the Department of State sent assurances to
                                Thailand that the bombing pause was not the prelude to U.S.
                                withdrawal from Southeast Asia, but a test to see if Hanoi could
                                come to a realistic appraisal of the situation. The United States
                                was in Vietnam “to stay whatever and how long it takes.” (Ibid.,

                            call on the Italian Govt and the press had not created any problems.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said we had had word from
                            Paris that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is prepared
                            to see <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> at noon tomorrow.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said the radio was
                            announcing that <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> had seen
                                <persName corresp="#p_GW2">Gomulka</persName> and was seeing Tito.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said there were two
                            proposals for H. 1) H might go on to India because India is a member of
                            the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>. Pres thought this a very good
                            idea. In covering this Pres thought it should be said that the Pres had
                            given his views in some detail to PM Wilson, Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_AKFMM1">Ayub Khan</persName>. He had sent <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McG Bundy</persName> to talk to Pearson; <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> to certain diplomats at the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and to the Pope because the Pope
                            had been in communication with the Pres and the Pres wanted him to know
                            his views on <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>; <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> will also be seeing others.
                            Pres said he thought <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> should
                            fly down and see the Pres of Mexico and tell him how strongly we feel;
                            how much we are trying; what we are trying to do. Pres thought India as
                            head of the Commission should be talked to. Pres thought Shastri needs a
                            little buttering up. Shastri should be told how much we are looking
                            forward to his visit; what a fine visit we had with his Agricultural
                            Minister; we thought the talks went very well with Ayub although there
                            is a lot of bitterness there; we thought the visit with Ayub a plus; we
                            are getting our experts together to go to India on their food problem;
                            and tell him how we feel on <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>; what can
                            they do; we salute them; we just want to keep them informed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> agreed these were all good
                            points and it would be good to get <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> out to see Shastri before he leaves for
                            Tashkent and sees the Russians. Pres thought in talking to Shastri the
                            point to be stressed would be the food problem and his visit. This gives
                            it a little cover and we don't want to give the impression that we are
                            in a panic or frantic, the Pres said.</p>
                        <p>Pres said he wanted to be sure that every person that should be informed
                            of our views is informed and that we come through loud and clear. Pres
                            said <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> knows how he feels—like
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> on this peace
                            business—but he is not sure this has been conveyed. Pres thinks that
                            this is now a good chance to do this.</p>
                        <p>Pres said he had talked to Bundy and told him to get in touch with
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and for them to spend an
                            hour to see who has not been informed and <pb n="750" xml:id="pg_750" facs="0782"/>who could be informed. Pres said it did no harm for an
                            Ambassador to say the Pres of the US asked me to tell you that he wants
                            you to know how he feels.</p>
                        <p>Pres said for <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> to get the
                                <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> thing cleared up.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he would do that
                            right away.</p>
                        <p>Pres said if it could be arranged for <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> to go by New Delhi it might be a good idea for
                            him to come by and see <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> agreed with this. Pres
                            thought they should be informed right away so they would not think they
                            were on the second table.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> told the Pres that the
                            Hungarians would rather not have <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> at the moment. They have given the impression
                            this would embarrass them.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that our intelligence
                            people had told us that Shelepin would probably be in Hanoi over the
                            week-end.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> had come in asking about
                            seeing Bo in Paris. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> told the
                            Pres that we had another contact we were reactivating there on another
                            basis. Pres thought we had better be careful here and he did not think
                            it wise for <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> to see Bo.
                            Pres said he would leave it up to <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s judgment. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he thought it would create problems. Pres said
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> should tell <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> to see just the above two and
                            when he finishes seeing them we would have other plans—imply that H will
                            come by there (Paris) later, but we don't want the visits too close
                            together. Pres said we did not want to mess the Bo thing up.</p>
                        <p>Pres asked <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> if he had any
                            ideas for Moyers. Pres said he had to be a little more affirmative. Pres
                            suggested saying, “The Pres, Sec. of State and Bundy have been giving
                            their views. We are going to other capitals. The discussions that are
                            taking place are not in any way unusual.” <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he thought this good enough and that the press
                            would be fairly understanding.</p>
                        <p>Pres said he thought <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> should
                            give some serious thought to getting away a few hours and flying down to
                            talk to Fulbright. Pres said <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                            was first to explain to <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName>
                            that the stories about his not being invited to the <gloss target="#t_WH1">WH</gloss> had no basis and were nonsense. Pres said
                            there was no custom where the head of the For. Relations Committee had
                            to be invited to all the <gloss target="#t_WH1">WH</gloss> functions.
                            Pres said they had checked the records and found that <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> had been invited to the
                                <gloss target="#t_WH1">WH</gloss> at least three times more than
                            anybody else. Second, when Princess Margaret was here, <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> had been in New Zealand.
                            Third, no one but govt people had been invited to the Wilson dinner. And
                            there was nothing significant about Ayub that they thought should call
                            for including <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> in the
                            dinner. Pres said <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> should
                            tell <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> that he (the
                            President) had been laughing about most of this bunk and that he thought
                            most of it was coming from Marcy. Re <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> should point out that this
                            is what <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> has been saying
                            and the Pres is trying to show our real feelings in the matter <pb n="751" xml:id="pg_751" facs="0783"/>and our attempt to do so is not
                            because we are in a panic. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                            should tell him that Bundy talked to Pearson; Pres talked to <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>; Bruce talked to Wilson. This is
                            just reiteration of our points and our feelings. It is just an execution
                            of what <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> has talked
                            about. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> should try to make it
                            a <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> proposal.</p>
                        <p>President thought <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> should do
                            the same thing with <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> should say the President
                            had thought it over carefully and thought he should try for peace.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> do not have any great hope but
                            in effect are doing what <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>
                            has said. Pres said <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> should
                            do this if he has someone in the Dept who could take over for him.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that Johnson was
                            backstopping him. Pres said this was fine if he had enough initiative to
                            go on through. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that
                            Dirksen was also in Florida. Pres said <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> should tell <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>, and Dirksen not to tell anyone that he is
                            coming down.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> mentioned Hickenlooper. Pres
                            said he should be talked to. Pres said Hickenlooper says he does not
                            know enough. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> should
                            emphasize that this is just a continuation of what the President has
                            said—starting in Baltimore. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                            should not let Hickenlooper think we are retreating. Re the bombing
                            nothing much could be gained by bombing during Holy Week; the weather is
                            not good; and we are just telling everybody about our position.</p>
                        <p>Pres told <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> to get Mann out and
                            for him to say we are exchanging views. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> is to tell <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> he should come back by the Ranch.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said re the <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> visit to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, they would like not to have
                            it announced until after the meeting. Pres agreed with this.</p>
                        <p>Pres thought more thought should be given to seeing some other people. He
                            said the main thing was to call them and tell them that the President
                            had asked <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> to talk to
                            them.</p>

                            Director General, FonMin, 7:30-8:00 p.m., December 29, 1965 at
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJA1">Gronouski</persName>'s
                            residence.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName> said the Polish
                            Government was treating our approach on the Viet-Nam matter very
                            seriously and would do its best and use all means at its disposal, but
                            he would like to impress upon us question of time. He said it was not
                            easy to communicate rapidly with Hanoi through ordinary channels and
                            they might have to use special means. He repeated it may take time to
                            get an indication of any value from Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>3. He said Poles were transmitting to Hanoi their opinions and judgment
                            together with their own formulation of U.S. position. He wanted to make
                            clear there would be no misunderstandings of the facts concerning U.S.
                            position in the Polish approach. He listed the following five points the
                            Polish Govt intends to send to Hanoi as their interpretation of U.S.
                            views:</p>
                        <p>A. The U.S. realized that in order to facilitate entry onto a road of
                            negotiations in the Viet-Nam conflict that a period of calm and
                            tranquility is required. So the U.S. made a pause in the bombing
                            beginning December 24. The U.S. expects that the Viet-Nam side will
                            reciprocate with a parallel gesture. The U.S. side hopes that mutual
                            gestures of that kind will facilitate entry on the road to negotiations.
                            The U.S. has made certain suggestions as examples of the gestures which
                            it would expect from the North Viet-Nam side. It envisages possibilities
                            of other types of gestures and would welcome any other similar gesture
                            from the North Viet-Nam [side].</p>
                        <p>B. The U.S. side is quite conscious of the need to give appropriate time.
                            However it wishes to draw attention to the difficulties stemming from
                            the convening of the U.S. Congress, the approaching budget
                            considerations and other domestic pressures. In this connection it would
                            appreciate some indication from the Viet-Nam side at the earliest
                            possible time.</p>
                        <p>C. The U.S. side has reiterated the statement of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s of July 28, 1965 that there
                            will be no difficulties with finding ways for the Front to present its
                            attitudes and views during talks. It elaborated, however, that it does
                            not recognize the Front as a government and from this fact, in the U.S.
                            opinion, would stem certain limitations for the role of the Front in the
                            possibility or event of a conference of the Geneva type. On the other
                            hand, future negotiations can take various forms. The U.S. attitude in
                            this regard is flexible and it is ready to consider the possibilities of
                            talks in all variations and with different participants including also
                            the National Liberation Front.</p>
                        <p>D. In the course of eventual talks the U.S. side is ready to discuss the
                            4 points of the DRV as well as all other proposals coming from other
                            parties including also South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <pb n="753" xml:id="pg_753" facs="0785"/>
                        <p>E. The U.S. side wishes also that the known position of the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> in the 14 point statement published on
                            December 29<note n="2" xml:id="d274fn2">See <ref target="#d248">Document
                                    248</ref>.</note> also be taken into consideration as expressing
                            the general attitude of the U.S.</p>
                        <p>4. I told <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName> there was an
                            urgent need for quick action and prompt response from Hanoi. I described
                            at some length the pressures affecting the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName>
                            reiterated that in such a complicated situation it was necessary to be
                            patient and quiet. He said the Polish initiative is in good faith and
                            time would be required. He said he understood pressures on <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, but we must understand Hanoi is in a
                            very delicate position and will need a little time to work out its
                            response.</p>
                        <p>5. He said Poles are convinced of necessity of secret negotiations and
                            they are afraid publicity might jeopardize their initiative. I agreed
                            the less publicity the better.</p>

                            very shortly after we informed <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that we were deferring resumption of bombing
                            indicates that visit arranged on some other basis. Our best guess is
                            that it was political in character (Shelepin being Party man) and
                            perhaps related to large volume of reports suggesting plans for early
                            conference of Soviet-oriented nations, in which Vietnam would be major
                            topic. We have reports Shelepin may arrive Hanoi over weekend, and his
                            presence and possible statements there may of course become major factor
                            in situation even though trip arranged on other grounds.</p>

                            significant substantive results from talks with Tito or Shastri.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> had useful, although
                            general, talk with Pope, who among other things expressed gratification
                            at message received from <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. You might
                            convey this to Do and indicate it was distinct plus in worldwide terms.

                            and will see <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> tomorrow.
                            We will naturally take no initiatives and will not encourage any from
                            French side.</p>

                            announced sometime tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>7. All of above adds up to continuing effort to demonstrate diplomatic
                            activity and to open all avenues for constructive Hanoi response. So far
                            there has been no such response. We have of course noted first indirect
                            Hanoi reference to situation but have not completed our analysis. At
                            first glance, Hanoi is at least taking somewhat different rhetorical
                            line, even though it concludes with familiar statements about accepting
                            four points and taking other actions.<note n="5" xml:id="d275fn5">Reference is to a broadcast by the Voice of Vietnam on December 30,

                            generally, as well as Hungarians over weekend, have indicated <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> representation issue may well become

                            Chauvel proposal might lend itself to such handling, although it would

                        <p>2337. For the Secretary from <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>.</p>
                        <p>1. In response to your 1821,<note n="2" xml:id="d276fn2">
                                <ref target="#d269">Document 269</ref>.</note> I called on
                            Archbishop Palmas, told him that I was indeed still interested in
                            meeting his “former Minister” and asked him if there was any news.</p>
                        <p>2. Palmas said that he had received a note from the “former Minister”
                            under date of December 23 (when I was in Bangkok) asking to be excused
                            because of his inability to come personally to express his good wishes
                            for Christmas and the New Year. The note went on to say that for more
                            than twenty years, the war had gone on in Vietnam and that he prayed to
                            God to put an end to it, saying that the Vietnamese people had paid a
                            heavy price, and that if the war continued there would be a “general
                            extermination”.</p>
                        <p>3. The note went on to say that he was “still waiting for news of the
                            matter we talked about”, adding that “when I do get news I will come and
                            we can examine the question together”.</p>
                        <pb n="756" xml:id="pg_756" facs="0788"/>
                        <p>4. On December 28, Archbishop Palmas acknowledged receipt of the note. He
                            showed me the note which was written in rather illegible French, and
                            down at the bottom was a rather illegible signature, which could be
                            interpreted as spelling out Hoac. If so, it would confirm our
                            surmises.</p>
                        <p>5. Palmas' theory that the “former Minister's” initiative had been
                            genuine, but had been quashed by Hanoi as soon as Hanoi heard of it
                            seems plausible.</p>
                        <p>6. We then branched out into a general discussion, with Palmas expressing
                            the view that the one thing above all others which was keeping the war
                            going was the division of opinion within the free world. He believed
                            that if the French Government would recognize the true interest of the
                            French people, and merely show verbal non-disapproval of the U.S. effort
                            that it would have a very discouraging effect in Hanoi. The Hanoi
                            regime, it appears, pays attention to French moods and French postures
                            way out of proportion to the amount of chips which France actually has
                            bought in the poker game—which is practically nil.</p>
                        <p>7. He said the fact that the Pope had sent messages both to <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName> did not mean that he equated
                            them both, or that he was unmindful of the fact that North Vietnam was
                            the aggressor and wished to exterminate Christianity. Indeed, said
                            Archbishop Palmas, if it were not for the arrival of American troops,
                            Christianity would already be in the process of extermination in South
                            Vietnam now, and he, Palmas, would not even be here at this time.</p>

                        <p>1. Upon reflection on talks at Warsaw I and officers traveling with me
                            are convinced from statements and attitude of <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName>

                            to carry our message faithfully to Hanoi and add their own arguments to
                            influence Hanoi. They are deeply concerned over their own possible
                            involvement if war continues to escalate and as <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> put it “everyone including U.S.
                            may lose control of events”.</p>
                        <p>2. Poles also frankly expressed concern over possibility of increased
                            Chinese influence unless we move towards peaceful solution.</p>
                        <p>3. The Poles repeatedly emphasized the time required to present their
                            arguments to Hanoi, indicating that their usual means of communication
                            were erratic and that special means might have to be used.</p>
                        <p>4. In order maintain pressure on Poles for prompt response from Hanoi you
                            may wish to authorize Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJA1">Gronouski</persName> to tell <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> that the U.S. Government is following with close
                            interest the Polish efforts with Hanoi and also explain purpose of my
                            trip to India as consultation with Chairman <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>—although we realize that Indians do not have the
                            intimate relations with Hanoi as have the Poles. Furthermore, because of
                            Polish emphasis on secrecy he might indicate that my visit to India
                                (<gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> Chairman) and other countries
                            will serve to divert attention from Polish efforts.</p>

                        <p>As requested in the Department's 2943,<note n="4" xml:id="d278fn4">Dated
                                December 30. (Ibid.)</note> I brought up the question of Cambodia
                            and told the General that our desire [was?] to preserve the neutrality
                            of this country provided Prince Sihanouk would maintain a neutral
                            attitude on his part. The General expressed the strong hope that the
                            Viet-Nam war not be extended in any form to Cambodia and I assured him
                            this was not our government's plan or desire. The problem, I explained,
                            was the failure on the part of the Cambodian Government and the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> properly to ensure that the border was
                            sealed and that Cambodia was not used as a sanctuary for the North
                            Vietnamese or Viet Cong and as a source of supply. I urged the General
                            as I had done earlier in the day to <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve de
                                Murville</persName> that the French Government support our efforts
                            for an enlarged and effective <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>
                            supervision of the international boundary. As reported in a separate
                            telegram <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> stated
                            that he had already made representations to this effect<note n="5" xml:id="d278fn5">The discussion between <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>, which lasted 50 minutes, was reported in
                                telegram 3700 from Paris, December 31. (Ibid.)</note> and the
                            General indicated support for this move.</p>
                        <p>I in turn on behalf of the President congratulated General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> upon his re-election, assured
                            him of the President's great respect for substantial achievements on
                            behalf of the people of France and thanked him for his courtesy in
                            receiving me as the President's representative on short notice.</p>
                        <p>The General then spoke at some length about Viet Nam. He said that the
                            President's latest move could have a good and constructive effect upon
                            world opinion and would strengthen the position of the United States in
                            the eyes of nations troubled as to its intentions. In all candor,
                            however, he added that he did not believe that the bombing pause would
                            lead to an acceptance by Hanoi of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s offer for unconditional negotiations at Geneva
                            or in any other forum. He said that in his view that only tenable
                            solution for the Viet Nam problem was the withdrawal of US forces but he
                            recognized how difficult this was since the honor and prestige of
                            America as a great and powerful nation was involved by its commitments.
                            Perhaps, he said, it is too late to consider whether these commitments
                            should have been publicly extended but he recognized that they were
                            there and that they were a substantial factor in the situation.
                            Notwithstanding, he stressed that he thought withdrawal was the key to a
                            solution of the problem and the only basis on which negotiations were
                            possible. This, he added, did not mean that American troops had to be
                            withdrawn immediately but he stressed that withdrawal had to be agreed
                            upon in principle before the negotiations commenced if Hanoi was to be
                            brought to the bargaining table. I intervened to point out that it has
                            been our repeated policy that we desire no permanent<pb n="759" xml:id="pg_759" facs="0791"/> presence in Viet Nam and that the
                            President and his advisors had made it clear that American troops could
                            and would be withdrawn after the aggression from the north ceased and
                            the south had an opportunity under free conditions to determine its own
                            destiny. The principle of self determination did not preclude
                            reunification, provided that the unification was determined by the
                            people of South Viet Nam in a free and properly supervised
                            [garble—election]. America, I added, however, would not withdraw its
                            troops under pressure or force and leave South Viet Nam and its people
                            to the tender mercies of the Communists.</p>
                        <p>This was not contemplated by the Geneva agreements and is not
                            contemplated by our government. Without debating the point, the General
                            went on to say that his view was that it was not detrimental to the
                            interests of the free world, including the United States, if all of Viet
                            Nam, Thailand and Laos were to have Asiatic Communist regimes. Asiatic
                            Communism, in his view, would not be either Chinese or Soviet Communism
                            but would follow its own patterns, and emergent nationalisms would
                            control the future of these countries. Cambodia could and might remain
                            neutralized although the same philosophy could be applied to Cambodia.
                            The General, however, recognized that America was, despite his contrary
                            views, firmly determined to support the independence and sovereignty of
                            South Viet Nam. Of course, he said, the United States has the power to
                            do this and perhaps after one or two years of demonstration of this
                            power Hanoi might be willing to come to the conference table but he did
                            not conceive that it would do so before then. Red China had no interest
                            in any peaceful accommodation in that area of the world but he agreed
                            that the Soviets and the Eastern bloc countries would be much more
                            likely to encourage a detente with the U.S. Hanoi, however, would not
                            now agree to any such detente and its lack of agreement would ultimately
                            be supported not only by China but by the Soviet Union and the other
                            bloc countries as well. I emphasized that one of the considerations
                            leading to the pause was the repeated assertions of the bloc countries
                            and even intimations from the Soviet Union that this would possibly lead
                            to the conference table. General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> dismissed this as an assumption on their part not
                            warranted by realistic understanding of Hanoi's determination to unite
                            the country along its lines and to eliminate American influence in the
                            area.</p>
                        <p>As requested in the Deptel,<note n="6" xml:id="d278fn6">See <ref target="#d278fn4">footnote 4</ref> above.</note> I did not
                            invite any proposals from President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> as to our future course of action nor did I
                            attempt to indicate what it would be if the bombing pause did not lead
                            to negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The views expressed by General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> were on his own motion.</p>
                        <pb n="760" xml:id="pg_760" facs="0792"/>
                        <p>The General reiterated that he was extremely grateful that the President
                            had sent him a private letter indicating our intentions and he was
                            particularly pleased that the President had dispatched me to give him a
                            more extended review of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s thinking in this grave matter.</p>
                        <p>He inquired about the President's health and I assured him that President
                            was in the best of health and spirits. I extended on behalf of the
                            President and Mrs. Johnson their best wishes for the New Year.</p>
                        <p>As the meeting concluded, I brought up the question of our cooperation at
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, pointing out that this was
                            increasingly necessary because of the voting strength of the Afro-Asian
                            bloc. I praised the cooperative attitude of his representative,
                            Ambassador Seydoux, and told General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> that the Ambassador had played a very cooperative
                            role in the Kashmir debate and in other matters before the Security
                            Council. I further said that the Ambassador and I had discussed the
                            necessity for coordination of the four big powers activities in
                            preparation for the next General Assembly. The General said in reply
                            that he in turn was grateful for my cooperation at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and that indeed the future of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> depended upon the cooperation of the five
                            major powers including China. He obviously meant Communist China. I said
                            that we were not finding Communist China cooperative in Viet Nam or
                            anywhere else. We parted, however, on the more cordial note of his
                            expression of greetings for the New Year to President and Mrs.
                            Johnson.</p>
