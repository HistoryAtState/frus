                <p rend="center">Foreword</p>
                <p>(This is not an official statement of policy by the Department of State; it is
                    intended only as a guide to the contents of this volume.)</p>
                <p>Since 1861, the Department of State's documentary series Foreign Relations of the
                    United States has constituted the official record of the foreign policy and
                    diplomacy of the United States. Historians in the Office of the Historian
                    collect, arrange, and annotate the principal documents comprising the record of
                    American foreign policy. The standards for the preparation of the series and the
                    general deadlines for its publication are established by the Foreign Relations
                    of the United States statute of October 28, 1991 (22 USC 4351, et seq.). Volumes
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations series</hi> are published when all
                    the necessary editing, declassification, and printing steps have been
                    completed.</p>
                <p>The documents in this volume are drawn from the centralized indexed files of the
                    Department of State and the decentralized Bureau, Office, and other lot files of
                    the relevant Departmental units. The volume is also unique among Foreign
                    Relations volumes in including documents from the Department of Energy, the
                    National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the papers of <persName

                    Society.</p>
                <p>Almost all of the documents printed here were originally classified. The
                    Information Response Branch of the Office of IRM Programs and Services, Bureau
                    of Administration, Department of State, in concert with the appropriate offices
                    in other agencies or governments, carried out the declassification of the
                    selected documents.</p>
                <p>The following is a summary of the issues covered. Parenthetical citations are to
                    numbered documents in the text.</p>
                <p>Summary</p>
                <p>This volume represents the growing importance of global issues in U.S. foreign
                    policy during the 1960s. For want of a specific definition, global issues are
                    interpreted in the volume as those subjects that transcend bilateral or regional
                    coverage yet do not fit neatly under other, more traditional functional areas
                    such as foreign economic policy or arms control. The volume does not cover all
                    global topics but is a selection of the more important ones. The amount of
                    documentary material, particularly at the highest levels of the U.S. Government,
                    was most influential in determining the choice of global issues.</p>
                <p>The volume provides a unique insight into President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                        >Johnson</persName>'s hopes of internationalizing the “Great Society.” The
                    goals were expansive, whether the arena was lunar exploration, efforts to use
                    technology to raise the living standards of the destitute poor, or the
                    possibility of beaming education to all direct from space. Many of the dreams
                    were only partially realized and some were outright failures, but the optimism
                    and the powerful belief that Americans could and would solve these problems left
                    an important legacy.</p>
                <p>By the end of 1968, however, problems that would plague diplomatic efforts over
                    the next 30 years were becoming apparent. America's desire to share the benefits
                    of scientific progress became diluted by the exigencies of the Cold War,
                    technology failed to solve all problems at an affordable cost; and new global
                    actors emerged, particularly in the Middle East, to change the dynamic and to
                    undermine global economic growth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="strong">The Technology Gap</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The phrase “technology gap” refers to the general and apparently growing
                    inequality in military power and economic strength between the United States and
                    its allies. European leaders, beginning with German Chancellor Erhard in
                    December 1965, became concerned about the disparity in the financial and
                    technical resources available to the Americans and the Europeans for research
                    and high-technology development. Their primary fear was that the “gap” would
                    result in permanent second-class status for Europe in newly emerging fields such
                    as computer science, the aerospace industry, and atomic energy.</p>
                <p>In December 1965 National Security Action Memorandum (NSAM) No. 357 directed the
                    Cabinet to name representatives to a committee chaired by President <persName
                        corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s Science Adviser, Dr. <persName
                        corresp="#p_HDF1">Donald Hornig</persName>, to study the problem. (5)
                        <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName>'s interdepartmental committee
                    delivered its first report in January 1967. It concluded that the technology gap
                    was primarily a political problem and recommended a strategy to encourage
                    greater U.S.-European cooperation and an integration of high-technology efforts.
                    (9) This analysis and strategy proved to be successful, leading to improved
                    U.S.-European dialogue; by December 1967 concern about the technology gap had
                    largely disappeared. (14)</p>
                <p>Most importantly, European beliefs as revealed in discussions of the technology
                    gap influenced attitudes about every other science and technology issue raised
                    during this period. In December 1967, <persName corresp="#p_HDF1"
                        >Hornig</persName>'s committee summarized the pervasive mood: “Some
                    Europeans are also concerned that major decisions affecting the future of
                    European industry, and even their national independence, may not be in their
                    hands. They feel they may be undesirably influenced by American corporate
                    decisions and by U.S. governmental trade and financial controls.” (15)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="strong">Cooperation in Space</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Questions of U.S. international prestige and coooperation with the Soviet Union
                    were predominant during <persName>Johnson</persName> administration discussions
                    on space exploration. (49) In January 1964 National Aeronautics and Space
                    Administration (<gloss target="#t_NASA1">NASA</gloss>) officials proposed
                    options for cooperative scientific exchanges between the two nations (21), an
                    approach formalized in NSAM No. 285, dated March 3, 1964. (25) The Soviet Union,
                    enjoying its own successes in space exploration, chose not to respond, causing
                    anxiety among U.S. policymakers. “We have not fully recovered from the blow to
                    our prestige, and the burden imposed on our diplomacy by the Soviet sputniks and
                    luniks and orbiting manned-space vehicles,” wrote the Chairman of the Policy
                    Planning Council in a December 1964 recommendation to Secretary of State
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> for a <gloss target="#t_NASA1"
                        >NASA</gloss> study of the effects of research and development in space
                    technology on world leadership. (28)</p>
                <p>Overseas, in order to build foreign identification with the U.S. program rather
                    than that of the Soviet Union, the United States encouraged the cooperative
                    space projects of its major allies (33) and actively supported the European
                    Space Research Organization (<gloss target="#t_ESRO1">ESRO</gloss>) and the
                    European Launcher Development Organization (<gloss target="#t_ELDO1"
                        >ELDO</gloss>). In July 1966 NSAM No. 354 clarified the U.S. attitude toward
                    cooperation with the Europeans and <gloss target="#t_ELDO1">ELDO</gloss>.
                    (52)</p>
                <p>In the later years of the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration,
                    policymakers turned their attention to future space goals and the high costs
                    associated with continuing the space race. (54) A Department of State policy
                    paper cast doubt on the long-term benefits of pursing the race: “from the
                    standpoint of our foreign policy interests, we see no compelling reasons for
                    early, major commitments to such goals, or for pursuing them at the pace which
                    has characterized the race to the moon.” (55) U.S. and Soviet space disasters in
                    late 1966 and early 1967 respectively led to fears that the space race was
                    endangering the lives of the astronauts and renewed calls for cooperative
                    ventures. (59) The Soviet Union again failed to respond, and space cooperation
                    efforts focused almost exclusively on Western Europe and communications
                    satellites.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="strong">Communication Satellites</hi>
                </p>
                <p>In early 1964 the European Conference on Satellite Communications invited the
                    United States and Canada to join a global telecommunications organization. From
                    the beginning, the Europeans knew that the United States would be the dominant
                    force “for the next few years” in the new organization since it was the only
                    nation actually to have launched communication satellites. U.S. officials
                    believed, however, that the Europeans really wanted to ensure that the United
                    States would not monopolize the system indefinitely. (63)</p>
                <p>Although the stated American intention was to operate a system that provided
                    opportunities for others to contribute as suppliers, investors, and designers,
                    domestic forces exerted strong pressure to mold the system first and foremost to
                    meet internal needs. The Department of Defense, for example, lobbied vigorously
                    to combine its own military satellite network with the proposed commercial
                    system, a move that Presidential advisers and key Congressmen thought would be
                    hypocritical in light of the Communication Satellite Corporation's (<gloss
                        target="#t_COMSAT1">COMSAT</gloss>) stated goal of a peaceful global system.
                    (69) Consequently, the Defense Department abandoned its plans to participate in
                    the international venture. (70)</p>
                <p>Two international agreements concluded in July 1964 established a
                    quasi-governmental system, <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss>,
                    operated by the U.S.-dominated commercial entity, <gloss target="#t_COMSAT1"
                        >COMSAT</gloss>. Final negotiations were scheduled for early 1969. (71) In
                    less than one year, however, Europeans officials were dissatisfied with the
                    dominant American role and expressed a desire to build their own national
                    systems with U.S. technical assistance. (72) While expressing a willingness to
                    provide assistance, U.S. policymakers wanted to discourage <gloss
                        target="#t_COMSAT1">COMSAT</gloss>'s commercial competitors to prevent a
                    “wasteful” duplication of systems. (73–74) By late 1966 the contradictions
                    between the twin goals of commercial competition and technological cooperation
                    were acute enough to require a review of NSAM No. 338 after just a single year.
                    (88) The July 1967 revision of NSAM No. 338 tried to clarify the U.S. position.
                    (96) By November the French and the Germans were openly discussing construction
                    of a wholly European satellite system. (98)</p>
                <p>The Soviet Union ignored cooperative overtures and refused to participate in
                        <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss>. The United States suggested a
                    round of talks at the upcoming UN Conference on Outer Space in August 1968, but
                    before the conference began, the Soviet Union proposed a rival system,
                    INTERSPUTNIK, as part of the United Nations system. (102, 103) INTERSPUTNIK
                    differed from <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss> in proposing a
                    policy of “one nation, one vote” rather than a system in which usage determined
                    control. The military invasion of Czechoslovakia by Soviet and Warsaw Pact
                    forces August 20–21 undermined the INTERSPUTNIK proposal. (106, 107)</p>
                <p>Ongoing anxiety about the stance of the Soviet Union nearly torpedoed the
                    conference scheduled for February 1969 when Sweden suggested moving <gloss
                        target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss> into the UN forum. In October and
                    November 1968 a concerted effort by the United States and Britain, who feared
                    that the Swedish proposal would undercut U.S. efforts to obtain Soviet

                </p>
                <p>In the early 1960s the United States seemed poised to enter a high-stakes race,
                    similar to the race for the moon, to develop a supersonic transport aircraft
                    (SST). The policy debate was dominated by fears about damage to American
                    prestige if the country fell behind the Soviet Union in another high-tech
                    battle. In 1963 State Department officials concluded that winning the race had
                    little value if the project was not directly tied to the overall goals of
                    American society, but the Federal Aviation Administration (<gloss
                        target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss>) believed that the nation should move quickly
                    to develop an SST. In June 1963 President Kennedy committed the United States to
                    an SST program, a decision endorsed by President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                        >Johnson</persName> in March 1964. (111)</p>
                <p>The United States chose not to join the Anglo-French Concorde consortium but
                    hoped to build a superior, wholly-American aircraft. The British Government,
                    facing severe economic constraints, proposed joint talks in January 1965 to
                    stabilize development schedules in order to avoid an uneconomic competitive
                    situation. A U.S. delegation met with the Concorde consortium, but refused to
                    limit U.S. design plans or tie the United States to any time schedule. (116)
                    Despite an <gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss> finding that test populations
                    found sonic booms to be unacceptably loud, 80 percent of the public, when
                    informed that the British, French, and Soviets were working on an SST, felt the
                    United States should proceed with its plans. (120)</p>
                <p>By January 1966 European officials again proposed an agreement to delay
                    introduction of an SST. U.S. Government opinion was divided, but strong
                    opposition from the Federal Aviation Administration scuttled an agreement. (124,
                    125) Concerned about the delays and mounting doubts about viability, the <gloss
                        target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss> approached Vice President <persName
                        corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Hubert Humphrey</persName>, Chairman of the National
                    Aeronautics and Space Council, to have the Council declare the project to be “of
                    the highest national urgency.” (126) NSAM No. 344 of April 1, 1966, formalized
                    that recommendation. (127)</p>
                <p>Unlike the Apollo manned space program, the American SST was doomed to failure by
                    1968 when questions arose as to whether the Concorde would be able to use
                    American airports. In April 1968 a Department of Transportation official called
                    the Concorde “a web of technical, legal, social, economic, and political
                    issues.” (129)</p>

                <p>The greatest technological advance of the 20th century, nuclear power, also
                    seemed to have tremendous potential as a tool of peace. In 1963 President
                    Kennedy had held discussions on the use of nuclear energy to provide fresh
                    drinking water, a proposal President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                        >Johnson</persName> also found highly attractive. (130)
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> considered it to be as important as space
                    exploration and “wanted to go all out for cooperation and maximum progress on
                    behalf of the whole world.” (133)</p>
                <p>The desalination proposal was important in two foreign policy arenas:
                    U.S.-Israeli relations and proposed cooperative ventures with the Soviet Union.
                    A Committee on Foreign Desalting Programs under the control of the State
                    Department was established in November 1964, and the United States proposed an
                    international conference on the topic to be held in Washington in October 1965.
                    (136) As the conference approached, a major bureaucratic split developed when
                    the Department of the Interior and the Atomic Energy Commission (<gloss
                        target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>) strongly lobbied for a larger-scale program
                    because of “considerations of national prestige.” (139)</p>
                <p>Officials at the State Department, Agency for International Development (<gloss
                        target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>), the Bureau of the Budget, and the Office of
                    the President's Science Adviser opposed a larger program, primarily because of
                    uncertainty about basing a major foreign aid initiative on untested and
                    uneconomic technology. Caution prevailed and the President announced a “Water
                    for Peace” program that fell short of the larger proposals and included a call
                    for another international conference. (144) In light of keen Presidential
                    interest, the split in the U.S. Government, and a strong push from Israel for an
                    agreement, policymakers felt the need for a more dispassionate analysis. In
                    August 1966 Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE6">Ellsworth Bunker</persName>
                    was tapped to study the proposals in depth. (152) His schedule prohibited a
                    long-term commitment of time, and <persName>Johnson</persName> named Secretary
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> as the overall coordinator in May
                    1967. (160)</p>
                <p>The outbreak of war in the Middle East in June 1967 gave new impetus to
                    desalination proposals as part of a possible settlement. (163) The idea also
                    re-emerged as a focus of Presidential interest when former President Eisenhower
                    made a proposal to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> on
                    June 25, 1967. (164) The White House suspected that Eisenhower's interest was
                    politically motivated. Although the former president assured them that his
                    interest was non-partisan, Eisenhower's Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_AEC1"
                        >AEC</gloss>, Lewis Strauss, took the proposal directly to the Senate.
                    Despite growing political pressure, problems with the Atomic Energy Commission's
                    test plant in California brought the initiative to a halt. (168)</p>
                <p>Israel continued to pursue the proposal, and in May 1968 the White House named a
                    new coordinator, former World Bank President <persName corresp="#p_WGD1">George
                        Woods</persName>. (171) <persName corresp="#p_WGD1">Woods</persName>
                    concluded that it was impossible to operate a large-scale desalination plant
                    economically without large cash subsidies. In mid-December 1968 the President
                    agreed to put <persName corresp="#p_WGD1">Woods</persName>' scaled-down proposal
                    for a much smaller plant in his last budget message to Congress. (174)</p>

                <p>“We can no longer brush <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> under the rug,”
                    representatives from the United Kingdom told their U.S. counterparts during a
                    bilateral meeting on petroleum problems in January 1964. (176) The formation of
                    the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in August 1960 had resulted
                    from the oil glut of the 1950s. Overproduction had led the major oil companies
                    to slash the prices paid to the producers while their own profits rose. The
                    producers had responded by joining together to maximize their bargaining power.
                    Official U.S. policy toward <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> had been one
                    of “neutrality and non-commitment,” but in November 1965, in light of <gloss
                        target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>'s diplomatic gains, the Department of State
                    decided that a reassessment was in order. (185)</p>
                <p>The Six-Day War of June 1967 hardened <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>'s
                    negotiating stance and moved some member states to nationalize oil company
                    assets. While the conservative sheikdoms of the Gulf supported the more radical
                    nations like Iraq and Algeria, they were unhappy with <gloss target="#t_OPEC1"
                        >OPEC</gloss>'s confrontational stance. As a result, the Organization of
                    Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (<gloss target="#t_OAPEC1">OAPEC</gloss>) was
                    founded in late 1967 to act as an umbrella organization for the conservative
                    Gulf states. (222) By the end of the <persName>Johnson</persName>
                    administration, oil company executives were “explosively critical” of U.S.
                    Middle East policy, which they believed was too pro-Israel and liable to damage
                    important American interests, including their own, in the region. (225)</p>

                    ushering in a protracted dispute with Western oil companies over the legality of
                    the measure. (179) The move sparked interest on the part of U.S. independent oil
                    companies eager to secure access to plentiful crude oil resources, but the State
                    Department discouraged them from making advances to Iraq pending the final
                    outcome of the dispute. (181) After the Six-Day War, Iraq's position hardened
                    and the Iraqis published Law 97 in August 1967, assigning the assets to a
                    government-owned entity, the National Iraq Oil Consortium (<gloss

                    Kingdom since the two nations represented members of the IOC. The Shah's
                    ambitious 5-year development plans left him constantly short of cash and jealous
                    of the monies paid to states with small populations such as Saudi Arabia and
                    Kuwait. One payment crisis was resolved in 1965 (198), but the issues arose
                    again in 1967. (203) The shutdown of Iraq's <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>
                    pipeline during the Six-Day War resulted in a 22 percent increase in Iranian
                    revenue for 1967. The Shah wanted a new agreement based on the artificially
                    inflated output levels and was disgruntled when his expectations went unmet.
                    (212) The immediate crisis was unresolved until April 1968 when a bookkeeping
                    sleight-of-hand allowed the Shah to “win” the confrontation with the consortium.

                </p>
                <p>As the political situation in the Middle East deteriorated, the U.S. Government
                    studied the effects of a crisis on world crude oil supply. While oil would be
                    expensive, the Department of the Interior concluded that the loss of two oil
                    regions plus use of the Suez Canal would be tolerable. (228) By late May 1967
                    Saudi Petroleum Minister Sheik Zaki Yamani told oil executives that he was
                    convinced war was imminent (229), and King Faisal warned the United States,
                    again through the oil companies, to stay out of the conflict. (231)</p>
                <p>In early June the region's oil ministers decided that supplies would be cut off
                    to nations that committed aggression, directly or indirectly. (235)
                    Oil-producing nations were split between those favoring nationalization and
                    those that saw the oil companies as “friendly instruments.” In an attempt to
                    keep the oil flowing, the companies agreed to bring Arab concerns to their
                    respective governments.(240)</p>
                <p>U.S. officials believed that a state of emergency did exist and were eager for
                    the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (<gloss
                        target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>) to coordinate the industrialized world's
                    response. (245) Some European nations were reluctant to cooperate closely:
                    Germany felt that the shortage was primarily a supply problem of the
                    Anglo-American oil companies (246), and France wanted to maintain as much
                    independence from the United States and United Kingdom as possible. (250) But
                    with no end to the crisis in sight by late June, French and German companies
                    took the first steps toward cooperation and tacitly agreed to participate in
                    technical fora. (254)</p>
                <p>The crisis abated in late July when Iraq, followed by Libya in August, resumed
                    shipments to most Western European countries. As oil stocks improved, the
                    Embassy in London reported that many were praising the United States for its
                    prompt response and insistence on urgent action. (261) On September 2 King
                    Faisal announced that Saudi Arabia would resume oil shipments to all countries
                    without exception.</p>
                <p>In the wake of the crisis, the State Department formed a committee to assess U.S.
                    national interests in the Middle East better and to determine whether or not
                    threats to those interests could be minimized. (265) <gloss target="#t_OPEC1"
                        >OPEC</gloss>, too, was absorbing the lessons of the crisis. Iran and
                    Venezuela reported that non-Arab members had been asked to limit their output to
                    help the Arabs pressure the Western Europeans. (266) But the crisis failed to
                    unify the oil producers. On January 9, 1968, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Libya
                    formed the more moderate Organization of Arab Exporting Countries (<gloss

                <p>The acute problem of global food shortages had been the subject of study during

                    concluded that the real problem was unchecked population growth although neither
                    wanted to openly discuss birth control issues. The problem, as seen by the
                    United States, was that huge population increases had a negative effect on
                    economic progress and left developing countries less prosperous and more in need
                    of foreign aid. (269)</p>

                    Population. Even though the issue was prominent in the United Nations and the
                    subject of growing Congressional interest, the Department opposed a commission
                    that it felt might render decision-making “more difficult and controversial.”
                    (270) The White House, too, was interested in taking action but kept a close eye
                    on the ongoing debate within the Vatican. In August 1965 NSC Staff member Robert
                    Komer suggested linking population control abroad “at least to the war on want.”

                <p>By late 1965 a White House staff review yielded a set of principles by which U.S.
                    Government policy could be guided. First, the problem should be treated
                    scientifically to avoid “obfuscating ideological dispute” on the propriety of
                    action; and second, the United States should stand ready to respond only to
                    assistance requests and should not advocate specific national population
                    policies. The President raised the issue at least six times during the first two
                    months of 1966. (277)</p>

                    more appealing to <persName>Johnson</persName>. (284) In April action by the
                    Vatican increased the likelihood of U.S. action. Pope Paul VI issued an
                    encyclical on population matters, which, according to State Department
                    officials, was so ambiguous that it was almost impossible to interpret. The
                    State Department chose to interpret it positively: “The fact that the entire
                    statement is ambiguous in several places and open to interpretation is itself
                    important in giving flexibility to officials, individuals and perhaps individual
                    priests.” (285)</p>
                <p>On May 12, 1967, <persName corresp="#p_RJD1">Rockefeller</persName> brought his
                    proposals to the President, who expressed interest in both the commission and
                    the statement. In June Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                    approved <persName>Johnson</persName>'s signature, in part because the Vatican
                    encyclical showed “a substantial advance.” (289) Later that month
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> decided to sign with the proviso that <persName
                        corresp="#p_RJD1">Rockefeller</persName> concurrently obtain the signatures
                    of other world leaders. In August British Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided
                    to sign the document, clearing the way for <persName>Johnson</persName> to
                    participate. (292) On December 11, 1967, the United Nations released the names
                    of 18 new signatories, bringing the total number of participating world leaders
                    to 30.</p>
                <p>Proactive measures on the population question soon ended. On July 29, 1968, the
                    Vatican released Pope Paul's new encyclical, Humanae Vitae, which overruled the
                    recommendations of the Papal Commission and called all forms of contraception
                    except voluntary continence “illicit.” (294) An August 1968 telegram to all
                    diplomatic posts summed up U.S. policy: “We do not wish to engage in any public
                    discussion of the Papal Encyclical and you should decline to comment if asked.”

                    <hi rend="strong">Hijacking</hi>
                </p>
                <p>While the hijacking of civilian aircraft was not a new problem, it became a much
                    more serious one during the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration. A
                    series of hijackings in 1961 led to a U.S. law declaring air piracy to be a
                    crime and paved the way for the Tokyo Convention of 1963 which awarded
                    jurisdiction to the aircraft's country of origin. Unfortunately, it had yet to
                    enter into force when a new rash of hijackings broke out in the late summer of
                    1967, intensifying during the spring of 1968. (296) The problem for the United
                    States was that hijackers invariably sought asylum in Cuba where they were out
                    of the reach of the American justice system.</p>
                <p>The United States privately appealed to the International Air Transport
                    Association (<gloss target="#t_IATA1">IATA</gloss>) to approach Cuba to seek
                    return of the hijackers. (299) <gloss target="#t_IATA1">IATA</gloss> officials
                    met with the Cubans at the United Nations in early August, but found them to be
                    uncooperative. In the view of the Cubans, the problems stemmed from the “stupid”
                    and “criminal” policies of the United States. They believed Cuba was the victim
                    and refused to cooperate. (301, 305)</p>
                <p>In a parallel approach, U.S. diplomats also asked the Government of Mexico, which
                    had also been the victim of hijackings, to talk to Cuba, apparently on its own
                    behalf. (300) The United States decided to halt the Mexican venture in October
                    1968 when <gloss target="#t_IATA1">IATA</gloss>'s attempt failed, rather than
                    have official U.S. interest revealed. (306) When three more aircraft were
                    hijacked in November, bringing the total to 15 in 6 months, the United States
                    asked <gloss target="#t_IATA1">IATA</gloss> President Walter Binaghi again to
                    approach Castro. (307)</p>
                <p>The hijacking of yet another plane in late November, bringing the 1968 total to
                    27, triggered direct U.S. action when the State Department decided to send an
                    official note to Cuba through the Swiss. The Cuban response, once again, was
                    non-committal. (311) At the end of the year, the United States asked Canada to
                    forward the same request. (314) No resolution of the problem was within
                    sight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="strong">Human Rights</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Problems of race and human rights emerged as issues on the foreign policy agenda
                    during the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration primarily in the context
                    of various international organizations. At the United Nations, the Human Rights
                    Commission began work on a convention against racial discrimination and
                    discussed proposals for an international Human Rights Year. In October 1964 the
                    U.S. delegation felt that it would be “premature” to make a recommendation for a
                    conference, a position that hardened to strong opposition the following month.
                    The delegation argued that it would be too expensive to stage a conference
                    independent of the General Assembly. (317)</p>
                <p>Other reasons soon emerged. The U.S. Mission to the United Nations felt that such
                    an event would mean “irresponsible use [of] conference platform for race and
                    other propaganda issues.” (321) Although the British Foreign Office shared the
                    State Department's views on the conference (“it would become involved in
                    black-white problems such as West Indians in <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                    and negroes in US”), both eventually bowed to strong pressure from the
                    developing world. (322) The Human Rights Conference was scheduled for April
                    1968, and the U.S. delegation was pleasantly surprised when there was almost no
                    criticism of American progress or problems. (329)</p>
                <p>Concurrently, the issue of race emerged in another UN agency, the International
                    Civil Aviation Organization, primarily a technical and regulatory body. During
                    its first major session in January 1964, several African states objected, for
                    the first time, to the participation of South Africa and Portugal. In July 1964
                    the Organization of African Unity announced a policy of isolation for those
                    practicing apartheid. (317) The African delegates continued the “black out”
                    tactic in another <gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss> meeting in November
                    1964, leaving the room whenever air transport to and from South Africa or the
                    African territories of Portugal came under discussion. (319) The U.S. delegates
                    lamented the emergence of political issues such as race in purely technical
                    fora, but it was a trend that would only intensify.</p>
                <p>Racial protest came to the Department of State in the later stages of the
                    administration. In May 1968 the Reverend Ralph Abernathy brought his Poor
                    Peoples' Campaign directly to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                        >Rusk</persName>. Their grievances included U.S. relations with South
                    Africa, Rhodesia, and Portugal; the Vietnam war; and the perceived failure to
                    comply with the provisions of the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo. <persName
                        corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> told the President that the delegation had
                    been “poorly informed.” (330) The following month, a group of Mexican-American
                    poverty marchers presented their grievances to the Mexican Ambassador to the
                    United States. (332)</p>
                <p>Although U.S. policy in the human rights arena by the end of the
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> administration seemed to be troubled by the
                    same problems straining domestic relations, those officials with long-term
                    involvement, such as the U.S. Representative to the Human Rights Commission
                        <persName corresp="#p_AMB1">Morris Abram</persName>, felt otherwise. In his
                    estimation, the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration had made significant
                    progress during a difficult time: “for the first time in the history of the
                    Commission, the men and women who speak for America no longer needed to
                    apologize for or equivocate about our national policy in matters of race. You
                    and your administration-by your firm words, by your legislative program, and by
                    your administrative actions-have made clear to the world the determination of
                    the Government of the United States to end once and for all time the terrible
                    burden of institutionalized or sanctioned racial discrimination.” (335)</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The series
                    documents the facts and events that contributed to the formulation of policies
                    and includes evidence of supporting and alternative views to the policy
                    positions ultimately adopted.</p>
                <p>The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for
                    the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The
                    staff of the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans,
                    researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. This documentary
                    editing proceeds in full accord with the generally accepted standards of
                    historical scholarship. Official regulations codifying specific standards for
                    the selection and editing of documents for the series were first promulgated by
                    Secretary of State <persName>Frank B. Kellogg</persName> on March 26, 1925.
                    These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by
                    Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992
                    and 1993, which was signed by President George Bush on October 28, 1991. Section
                    198 of P.L. 102–138 added a new Title IV to the Department of State's Basic
                    Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations series</hi> be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government.
                    The statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary
                    Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the
                    principles of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered
                    or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has
                    been made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the
                    purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations series</hi> be published not more than
                    30 years after the events recorded. The editor is convinced that this volume,
                    which was compiled in 1996–1997, meets all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly
                    standards of selection and editing.</p>

                <p>In preparing each volume of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations series</hi>,
                    the editors are guided by some general principles for the selection of
                    documents. Each editor, in consultation with the General Editor and other senior
                    editors, determines the particular issues and topics to be documented either in
                    detail, in brief, or in summary.</p>
                <p>The following general selection criteria are used in preparing volumes in the <hi

                    vary these criteria in accordance with the particular issues and the available
                    documentation. The editors also apply these selection criteria in accordance
                    with their own interpretation of the generally accepted standards of
                    scholarship. In selecting documentation for publication, the editors gave
                    priority to unpublished classified records, rather than previously published
                    records (which are accounted for in appropriate bibliographical notes).</p>

                <p>The Foreign Relations statute requires that the published record in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations series</hi> include all records needed to
                    provide comprehensive documentation on major U.S. foreign policy decisions and
                    significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires that government
                    agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government engaged in
                    foreign policy formulation, execution, or support cooperate with the Department
                    of State Historian by providing full and complete access to records pertinent to
                    foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected
                    records. Many of the sources consulted in the preparation of this volume have
                    been declassified and are available for review at the National Archives and
                    Records Administration. The Department of State and other record sources used in

                <p>The editor of the volume sought to include documentation illuminating the foreign
                    policymaking process of the U.S. Government, with emphasis on the highest level
                    at which policy on each of the particular subjects was determined. The documents
                    include memoranda and records of discussions that set forth policy issues and
                    show decisions or actions taken. The emphasis is on the development of U.S.
                    policy and <pb n="VI" xml:id="pg_VI" facs="0006"/>on major aspects and
                    repercussions of its execution rather than on the details of policy

                    policy decisions during his presidency, and the editor sought to document his
                    role as far as possible. Although the foreign policy record of the
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> administration is voluminous, many internal
                    discussions between <persName>Johnson</persName> and his advisers were not
                    recorded. The record of <persName>Johnson</persName>'s involvement as well as
                    that of Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> in the
                    policy process often had to be pieced together from a variety of sources.</p>
                <p>The volume focuses on the issues that primarily engaged high-level U.S.
                    policymakers. Major topics include: 1) scientific issues, including U.S.-Soviet
                    cooperation in outer space, communication satellites, and water for peace; 2)
                    selected global issues; and 3) energy problems, especially oil policy and the
                    U.S. response to the 1967 oil embargo. The editors also performed research on
                    additional issues, such as the European Atomic Energy Community and the
                    International Atomic Energy Agency, which might supplement coverage in other
                    volumes on the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration, but determined that
                    the documentary record was mostly bilateral and regional and did not warrant
                    separate compilations in this volume.</p>

                </p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time or, in
                    the case of conferences, in the order of individual meetings. Memoranda of
                    conversation are placed according to the time and date of the conversation,
                    rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations series</hi> follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text
                    is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations,
                    which are described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed
                    according to accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents in
                    the limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied by the editor
                    for each document included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and
                    punctuation are retained as found in the source text, except that obvious
                    typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the
                    source text are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic
                    type; an addition in roman type. Words or phrases underlined in the source text
                    are printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in
                    the source text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the front matter of
                    each volume.</p>
                <pb n="VII" xml:id="pg_VII" facs="0007"/>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for declassification purposes
                    have been accounted for and are listed by headings, source notes, and number of
                    pages not declassified in their chronological place. The amount of material
                    omitted from this volume because it was unrelated to the subject of the volume,
                    however, has not been delineated. All brackets that appear in the source text
                    are so identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document's source, original
                    classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also provides
                    the background of important documents and policies and indicates whether the
                    President or his major policy advisers read the document. Every effort has been
                    made to determine if a document has been previously published, and, if so, this
                    information has been included in the source footnote.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>

                    Department's Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and memoranda of conversations between
                    the President and Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the files of
                    overseas diplomatic posts. All the Department's indexed central files for these
                    years have been permanently transferred to the National Archives and Records
                    Administration (Archives II) at College Park, Maryland. Many of the Department's
                    decentralized office (or lot) files covering this period, which the National
                    Archives deems worthy of permanent retention, are in the process of being
                    transferred from the Department's custody to Archives II.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations series</hi> also have full
                    access to the papers of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                    and other White House foreign policy records. Presidential papers maintained and
                    preserved at the Presidential libraries include some of the most significant
                    foreign affairs-related documentation from the Department of State and other
                    Federal agencies including the National Security Council, the Central
                    Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff.</p>
                <p>In preparing this volume, the editors conducted research in a wide range of
                    manuscript sources. They made particularly extensive use of Presidential papers
                    and other White House records at the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.
                        Johnson</persName> Library. Some White House memoranda, including memoranda
                    to the President, document President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                        >Johnson</persName>'s concern with these scientific, energy, and global
                    issues. The bulk of the foreign policy records at the
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> Library are in the subject and country files
                    and the other component parts of the National Security File, and in the papers
                    of the President's science adviser.</p>
                <p>The Department of State arranged for access to the many audiotapes of President
                        <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s telephone conversations
                    that are held at the Johnson Library. These audiotapes include substantial
                    numbers of telephone conversations between President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                        >Johnson</persName> and his principal foreign policy advisers and key
                    members of Congress. The editors of this volume cited for publication a summary
                    of one audiotape of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s
                    telephone conversation dealing with water for peace.</p>
                <p>Second in importance only to the White House records at the
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> Library were the records of the Department of
                    State. The Department's central files contain the cable traffic recording U.S.
                    diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, European nations, and the Middle <pb
                        n="XVI" xml:id="pg_XVI" facs="0016"/>East, memoranda of diplomatic
                    conversations, and memoranda proposing action or providing information. Some
                    important documents are found only in the Department's lot files. Documentation
                    on initiatives that were not approved is often found only in desk or bureau
                    files.</p>
                <p>The papers of <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Hubert H. Humphrey</persName> at the
                    Minnesota Historical Society were also very useful. Vice President <persName
                        corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> was chairman of the National
                    Aeronautics and Space Council and took an active interest in the problems of
                    rapid population growth and family planning matters in the developing world as
                    well as world food production.</p>
                <p>The editors also collected documents on space policy in the Historical Reference
                    Collection at the National Space and Aeronautics Administration and on energy
                    policy at the Department of Energy Archives.</p>
                <p>Almost all of this documentation has been made available for use in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations series</hi> thanks to the consent of the
                    agencies mentioned, the assistance of their staffs, and especially the
                    cooperation and support of the National Archives and Records Administration.</p>
                <p>The following list identifies the particular files and collections used in the
                    preparation of this volume. The declassification and transfer to the National
                    Archives of the records of U.S. government agencies is in process. Many of the
                    records are already available for public review at the National Archives. The
                    declassification review of other records is going forward in accordance with the
                    provisions of Executive Order 12958, under which all records over 25 years old,
                    except file series exemptions requested by agencies and approved by the
                    President, should be reviewed for declassification by 2000.</p>

                                second held by the organization. The initial session in October 1963
                                opened a debate on the importance of science and technology to the

                                at the 1966 session, and an additional series of studies on what

                            Acting Secretary. I recognize the problem of the technological gap
                            between the United States and Europe, but until our ideas on this
                            question have been thoroughly digested I would suggest we play it in a
                            low key.<note n="2" xml:id="d2fn2">

                                “Marshall Plan for Technology” with Italian Foreign Minister
                                    <persName corresp="#p_FA5">Amintore Fanfani</persName> on June
                                5. (Telegram 309 from Brussels, June 5; ibid., <gloss
                                    target="#t_SCI1">SCI</gloss> 1–1 NATO)</note> The technological
                            gap exists primarily because European industrial enterprises have failed
                            to organize themselves on an adequate scale of size and have not
                            developed the practice of investing a sufficient proportion of their
                            sales dollars in research. The Europeans now have a big common market
                            and European firms should be encouraged to consolidate to meet the
                            requirements of that market. At the same time, they should modernize
                            their practices and increase their research budgets.</p>
                        <p>For us to assist this process by a technological subsidy would, I think,
                            be doubtful wisdom, since it might serve to perpetuate bad European
                            practices. Moreover, a substantial part of our favorable trade balance
                            with the world depends upon our technological superiority and we should
                            not give it away for nothing.</p>
                        <p>My views on this question are not fully developed and I would not wish to
                            prejudice the evolution of some progress in this field, but I feel that
                            we should be quite restrained in suggesting such a program before we
                            have thoroughly thought it through.<note n="3" xml:id="d2fn3">Although

                        <p>At <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>'s suggestion, I am
                            reporting for your information a number of measures that I believe could
                            be helpful in attacking the “technological gap” between the United
                            States and Europe. Dean Acheson discussed this problem with me last week
                            in connection with his study for NSAM 345.<note n="2" xml:id="d3fn2"
                                >National Security Action Memorandum No. 345 dealt primarily with
                                nuclear planning, but in it the President also noted his “wishes to
                                have developed other forward-looking proposals that would increase
                                the cohesion of NATO and the North Atlantic Community.” For text of
                                NSAM No. 345, see <ref target="frus1964-68v13#d159">Foreign
                                    Relations, 1964–1968, vol. XIII, Document 159</ref>.</note> We
                            agreed that the basic problem of the “technological gap” relates to such
                            fundamental issues as the size of European markets, European management
                            procedures, and policies toward capital investment in industry, research
                            and development and education, and that these problems could not be
                            cured by any package of technological proposals that we might offer.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, I do believe that there are specific proposals that
                            would point the Europeans in the right direction toward solving these
                            problems, would have a unifying effect on Europe, and would help remove
                            the widespread impression in Europe that the United States was trying to
                            perpetuate the “technological gap.”</p>
                        <p>I have given some preliminary thought to the following specific proposals
                            on which we could move relatively quickly: <list>

                                    <hi rend="italic">NATO Computer Center</hi>. Europe is
                                    considerably behind this country in the use of modern computers
                                    which are fundamental to advanced technology, business
                                    management, economic planning, etc. Although these computers are
                                    on the open market, the required investment is too great for the
                                    smaller European countries and most industrial concerns. We
                                    could therefore propose that a very advanced computation center,
                                    using both US and European hardware, be established and operated
                                    by NATO. This center, which could be remotely connected with
                                    other facilities by existing telephone lines, could serve NATO

                                    space projects. We have tried to make such information available

                                    we could propose a NATO technological information service that
                                    would perform similar services there. The participating

                            political tensions resulting from the “technological gap” problem even
                            though it would not solve it.</p>

                            for technological and scientific cooperation between Europe and the
                            United States. Attached are brief notes on fourteen such proposals.
                            There are a large number of bilateral and multilateral projects current
                            between Europe and the United States; the ones we have selected

                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> officials have admitted to
                                Embassy Rome that the main purpose of the Italian proposal is
                                political, planned to breathe new life into the Atlantic Alliance by
                                an action which will hopefully capture the public imagination. The
                                Italians also hope that it may counter the effect of the French NATO
                                policy and perhaps even induce France to reconsider the benefits of
                                the Alliance. For this reason the Italians believe that their
                                proposal should be taken up by NATO rather than EEC or <gloss

                            <p>The document notes that the technological gap between the U.S. and
                                other developed countries of the Western World is growing and
                                becoming a matter of serious concern. The prospects of economic
                                unbalance and its undesirable political consequences, “psychological
                                discomfort”, and weakening of the West lead to the necessity of an
                                initiative directed towards an increasing and balanced advancement
                                of the countries of the Atlantic zone.</p>
                            <p>The initiative should emphasize the paramount importance of close
                                collaboration among European countries, and promote greater
                                collaboration between Europe and the United States.</p>
                            <p>In essence, two things must be brought about: <list>
                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item>A “new technological drive” for Western Europe.</item>

                                </list>
                            </p>
                            <p>The initiative should be launched by a “common declaration” of the
                                NATO Governments, proposing to convene a conference to negotiate a
                                “technological agreement”. Interested non-NATO Governments would be
                                invited to participate.</p>
                            <p>Then an “international institution” would be established to
                                coordinate the European effort and to execute the agreement with the
                                U.S. The immediate task would be to elaborate a “ten-year plan for
                                technological development”, with a determination of “priority
                                areas”, such as <list>

                            <p>Another important requirement is the establishment of a method of
                                cooperation between Europe and the U.S. There can be cooperation on
                                “specific projects,” such as planetary exploration, a great
                                protonsynchrotron, and a hydrogen-oxygen space booster. One can also
                                envisage “sector cooperation,” for instance in electronics within a
                                framework of “production agreements” with the U.S.</p>

                            <p>Only a few preliminary comments have been received from posts in NATO
                                countries. They indicate considerable interest in the <persName
                                    corresp="#p_FA5">Fanfani</persName> proposal but also
                                skepticism. The existence and seriousness of the technological gap
                                is generally recognized, but some think that <gloss
                                    target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> may be a better vehicle for
                                action than NATO. The vagueness of the Italian proposal with respect
                                to the nature of the “Technological Agreement” is noted, but no
                                useful constructive comments have yet emerged.</p>

                                initiative and recognized the desirability of cooperative action in
                                the technological sphere.</p>
                            <p>The Department and other agencies are studying the proposal. We have
                                put a number of questions to the Italians in an attempt to
                                understand better their thinking—and perhaps to induce them to
                                clarify their own ideas, which are clearly grandiose but also
                                somewhat fuzzy as presented in their memorandum. We have told the
                                Italians that we agree with the implication of the memorandum that
                                the primary emphasis should probably be placed on project, as
                                opposed to sector, cooperation, and that we see no necessary
                                conflict between the Italian proposal and the study of technological
                                potentials that the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> is
                                undertaking. We do not believe the value of technological
                                cooperation depends on the validity of the “technological gap”
                                concept, which is an oversimplified approach to the subject.</p>
                            <p>We are sympathetic to the Italians' desire to use an approach to the
                                technological problem to strengthen NATO and European unity.
                                However, we will be in a better position to take a position on the

                        <p>I have been impressed with the increasing concern in Western Europe over
                            possible disparities in advanced technology between the United States
                            and Europe. While many Europeans are convinced that this “technological
                            gap” exists, there is substantially less agreement on its nature and
                            extent, its causes and possible remedies.</p>
                        <p>As I indicated in my October 7 speech,<note n="2" xml:id="d5fn2">For

                            should also examine ways in which the United States might engage

                        <p>I have been asked by the President to chair an interdepartmental

                            the United States and Western Europe, and to explore courses of action.
                            A preliminary report to the President is due January 30, 1967.</p>
                        <p>It is the purpose of this memorandum to request the early designation of
                            a representative of your agency to serve on the committee, and to

                        </p>
                        <p>Although there have been many discussions of the matter (see attached
                            background material), little has emerged in the form of specific
                            proposals that would be appropriate and effective in dealing with the
                            root causes of the European concern which has been expressed primarily
                            at political levels in Europe. As the NSAM points out, there is less
                            agreement on its nature and extent of the technological gap, its causes
                            and possible remedies. It is clear that the problem is exceedingly
                            complex and that no single factor such as relative technological
                            capabilities or investments in <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss> is
                            responsible for differences in competitiveness <pb n="11" xml:id="pg_11"
                                facs="0041"/>within industrial sectors. Management attitudes, market
                            size, availability of venture capital, educational infrastructure,
                            mobility of technical manpower and ideas, among other factors, are
                            necessarily involved.</p>
                        <p>In light of the developments to date, it is timely to consider and devise
                            constructive approaches to U.S.-European cooperation whereby the U.S.
                            might appropriately facilitate technological advance and industrial
                            innovation in Europe without restraining such advance in the U.S., and
                            to utilize technological and industrial advance as a unifying rather
                            than a divisive force in the Western community. The work of the
                            committee should bring about a common understanding within the
                            government of the nature of the problem, and should develop major new
                            initiatives and a strategy for carrying them out through new modes of
                            cooperation as well as through the various agency contacts with European
                            governments and international organizations.</p>
                        <p>In consideration of the above, the following questions come to mind.</p>
                        <p>First, there are questions of policy and research cooperation, including: <list>

                                    scientific and technological advance?</item>

                                    and innovation in U.S. industry?</item>

                                    the creation of a more favorable climate for the growth of

                                    and engineers from Europe to the U.S., e.g., through changes in
                                    visa procedures, control of recruitment practices of U.S.

                        </p>
                        <p>Second, there are questions of organization and approach to European
                            governments, including: (a) what combination of European countries are
                            we encouraging to develop cooperative proposals—NATO, <gloss

                            extended to Eastern Europe; (b) what is our position on the respective
                            roles and activities of existing organizations, particularly NATO and
                                <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>; use of international
                            scientific organizations such as EURATOM, <gloss target="#t_ESRO1"

                            EEC, ECE, the Coal and Steel Community; (c) should further European
                            initiatives be encouraged to organize intra-European discussion and to
                            consider new forms of cooperation and organization (such as a
                            Technological Community or a ten-year plan)?</p>
                        <p>At the first meeting of the committee, I hope that your representative
                            will be prepared to present views on the character of the problem, on
                            the nature of your agency's involvement with the various facets of it,

                                was mentioned during the Erhard visit of last September when the
                                President indicated that the United States stands ready to respond
                                to any proposals by our European allies in the area of advanced
                                technology. Reference was made to the initiatives of the Italian

                            <p>As an outcome of the Ministers of Science meeting, the <gloss

                                recently initiated a study of the differences in technological

                                which will include a detailed examination of nine industrial sectors
                                and will attempt to analyze all of the factors that influence the
                                exploitation of technological potentials in attaining economic and
                                other national objectives (Attachments E and F).</p>
                            <p>The U.K. interest in this problem has recently been expressed in an
                                address by Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WC1"
                                    >Wilson</persName> on November 14, 1966, calling for the
                                creation of a new European technological community (Attachment
                                G).</p>
                            <p>The French have raised this theme on a number of occasions, for
                                example in computers and satellite communications, and in
                                discussions I have had with French Minister of Science <persName

                            <p>U.S.-European cooperation in advanced technologies has also been
                                mentioned in the NATO context as a means to achieve greater
                                cohesiveness among member nations. It is raised, for example, in the
                                    <persName corresp="#p_FA5">Fanfani</persName> proposal.</p>
                            <p>Perhaps the best summation of the European point of view on
                                U.S.-European technological disparities is expressed in the attached
                                talk by Mr. <persName>Theodore Lefevre</persName>, former Belgian
                                Prime Minister, given at Harvard last December (Attachment H). On
                                the other hand, a study by Joseph Rosa shows that the rate of
                                economic growth in most Western European countries over the past 15
                                years compares very favorably with that of the U.S. (Attachment

                                important to U.S. First is problem of “technological gap” between
                                Western Europe and U.S. which is primary subject this guidance.
                                Second is implication any U.S. response may have in East-West
                                context. Third is fact science and technology disparities is global
                                problem and great gap between industrialized countries and <gloss

                            <item>In one sense “technological gap” is by-product of American
                                economic and military superiority over Europe and European reaction
                                to this predominance. Europeans concerned that European industry
                                will be unable to compete with marketable products of advanced
                                technology even though technological superiority today in some areas
                                rests with Europe. Gap concept reflects fear of “bigness” and is
                                consciously used to stimulate larger government investment in
                                science and technology. Problem unlikely be resolved in foreseeable
                                future because Europeans unable on national basis to marshal
                                resources needed to transform their societies at same pace as

                                        to European charges that U.S. is responsible for
                                        “technological gap” and consciously seeks to maintain it.
                                        These may include a reassessment of our export controls, a
                                        look at U.S. corporate practices abroad, U.S. visa and
                                        immigration policy, and field of restrictive business
                                        practices. In this re-examination, U.S. must keep in mind
                                        that it would not be in our interest to restrain U.S.
                                        competitive position or to give away American technology
                                        through a Marshall Plan type program. Our aim is to diminish
                                        disparities through promoting a two-way flow of cooperation.
                                        At same time, we must recognize that the greatest volume of
                                        scientific and technological exchange occurs in private or
                                        commercial channels, and that role of U.S. government is

                                this analysis comes perilously close to the rather chilly U.S. reply

                                world is larger and more important than the gap between Europe and
                                the U.S.; (b) the U.S.-Europe gap is primarily a question of
                                political and economic organization, and insufficient effort on the
                                part of the Europeans; (c) the U.S. has been generally forthcoming
                                in making scientific and technical information available and in its
                                readiness to cooperate with its European allies whenever they were
                                willing to meet us halfway, so that U.S.-European technical
                                cooperation is essentially a matter of trying to do a little better
                                what is already underway; and (d) no single step, whether a
                                “Marshall Plan” or a cooperation project, initiated by the U.S. cld
                                substitute for an across-the-boards effort by Europeans to improve

                                It will also respond to the political need to show that Atlantic

                            <item>But the broadest, most important, and most central NATO role
                                should properly be in fostering cooperation among NATO governments
                                in the general field of military technology and future weapons
                                research and production. It has, in the past, been a frustrating
                                field in which to seek cooperation—but if we fail to find
                                significant areas of cooperative development and production, then
                                NATO will be subject to the criticism that it has failed to
                                contribute in its peculiar area of responsibility to doing what
                                could be done with the “technological gap” problem. Conversely,
                                since a major reason for European difficulties in weapons
                                development even with bilateral U.S. help is that the industrial
                                capabilities and markets are too small on a national scale, we can
                                use the current dialogue on the “technological gap” to urge again a
                                broader European base and a multilateral approach.</item>

                            <item>As the “technological gap” comes under intensified discussion at
                                the ministerial level and in public, NATO is just breaking in new
                                machinery in its continuing effort to identify and initiate
                                cooperative arms development and production. The Conference of
                                National Armaments Directors is the capstone of a new committee
                                structure which is intended to be more flexible and pragmatic than
                                the old apparatus, dismantled last year, which succeeded in holding
                                innumerable discussions and exchanges of information, but put in
                                train very few actual hardware programs.</item>

                                must be so in this area, the U.S. representatives in the <gloss

                                interest of his colleagues by saying something about how the U.S.
                                views the problem and the potential contribution of the <gloss

                                its solution; and (b) he should stress the importance of a flexible
                                and pragmatic approach which, in the <gloss target="#t_CNAD1"
                                    >CNAD</gloss> and in the advisory groups, seeks to identify

                                NATO countries. If there is no other, the Defense <gloss

                        <p>On November 25, 1966, you asked me to chair an Interdepartmental
                            Committee to examine the problem of the “technological gap” between the
                            United States and Western Europe and to explore possible courses <pb

                        </p>
                        <p>In this connection, the main issue which may face you in the near future
                            concerns our position with respect to initiatives generated in Europe,
                            such as the <persName corresp="#p_FA5">Fanfani</persName> proposal, and
                            the development of constructive responses to such initiatives.</p>
                        <p>The term was originated by Europeans and has been surrounded by a certain
                            amount of controversy and confusion. Therefore, the first effort of the
                            Committee has been to clarify the reality behind the expression
                            “Technological Gap”.</p>
                        <p>Our preliminary assessment convinces us that the Technological Gap is
                            mainly a political problem although it has roots in actual disparities.
                            A much higher degree of European economic integration will surely
                            contribute in a major way to alleviating the underlying economic
                            problems. We cannot be sure at this stage whether real progress will be
                            made in this direction. U.K. entry into the Common Market offers the
                            most promise at this time for narrowing technological/industrial
                            disparities, though the success of the U.K. effort is far from certain.
                            If progress is not made, widening disparities could pose longer range
                            economic problems for the United States. Therefore, we have recommended
                            a strategy to convert European resentment over the Gap into a
                            constructive source of support for greater intra-European
                            cooperation.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, unless there is European progress in a host of factors, such
                            as education at all levels, work habits, and management and marketing
                            practices, as well as in properly conceived research and development
                            programs, the U.S. advantage is not likely to be diminished.</p>
                        <p>Since the Gap is an important factor in U.S./European relations, we need
                            to develop a deeper understanding of its economic and political aspects.
                            We believe that we have identified the general nature of the problem,
                            but our formulation will not be complete until we have heard further
                            from the European governments, which are just now beginning to discuss
                            the question among themselves.</p>
                        <p>We are also investigating specific actions this government could take
                            both to show its good will and to deal with the substance of the issue,
                            but are not yet prepared to recommend any of them to you at this
                            time.</p>
                        <p>This report is, therefore, an interim report. Its main object is to
                            define the political and economic problem as we see it, to outline a
                            strategy for U.S. steps to be taken abroad in the near future, and to
                                <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0051"/>indicate the areas we are
                            examining for possible action by this government and the European
                            governments. We expect to submit a final report to you this June.</p>

                                concentration on technology; (b) the main responsibility for making
                                progress in diminishing the gap belongs to the Europeans themselves,
                                with some cooperation by the US at appropriate but later stages; (c)

                                avoided. (None of these points were formally summarized as NAC
                                consensus, however.) On procedure, NAC agreed on terms of reference
                                for a special working group to draft a report for the Permanent
                                Council to submit to the NATO Ministers in June (see below).</item>

                            <item>As for the complexity of the problem, most speakers said that if
                                progress was to be made on narrowing the gap it could not be the
                                result of a simple device. <persName corresp="#p_FA5"
                                    >Fanfani</persName> for instance did not mention “sharing
                                patents” or anything of this type in his remarks. He stressed
                                instead the serious political consequences for the future if the gap
                                is allowed to grow. The other main point of his remarks concerned
                                procedure (see below). Dell warned that there was a danger in
                                getting too involved with the gaps that exist in glamour industries.
                                The real problems lay in less dramatic fields such as industrial
                                management and market organization. Spaey also stressed the
                                complexity of the problem and the need to distinguish between the
                                study aspect and the operational aspect. Boon (Netherlands) stated
                                that Europeans must avoid only analyzing symptoms and should get to
                                the roots. In the Dutch view there were four key elements that made
                                up the roots of the problem: 1) mentality, 2) management, 3)
                                organization, 4) finance. He believed no progress could be made in
                                any of these areas unless there was increased European
                                integration.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>There also seemed to be agreement that the Europeans had to tackle
                                this problem themselves in the first instance. While the speakers
                                did not ignore the possible cooperation of the US it seemed obvious
                                that they realized that they could not and should not look to US
                                initially for help. Spaey underlined that Europe cannot simply
                                depend on US assistance but must grow to a point where there can be
                                a profitable two-way exchange between Europe and the US. The primary
                                responsibility of the Europeans was in the remarks of all speakers,
                                ranging from the emphatic to the implicit.</item>

                            <item>Within the same range there was also agreement that duplication of
                                effort among the international institutions had to be avoided. While
                                it seemed to be agreed that NATO should initially identify the
                                various aspects of the gap problem which come under cognizance of
                                other international organizations and that NATO would eventually end
                                up itself with the defense technology aspect, it was not wholly
                                clear from the Europeans discussion how work between the <gloss
                                    target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> and the EEC would be split up or
                                phased. <persName corresp="#p_FA5">Fanfani</persName> talked about 5
                                stages of activity which might take place in dealing with the gap:
                                a) each country first takes stock of its national situation; b) then
                                stock-taking by the EEC, by EFTA and then by both organizations as a
                                whole; c) after that discussions between the two sides of the
                                Atlantic; d) gap diminution efforts would then be widened to other
                                European countries; <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0053"/>and e)
                                such efforts would then extend to other countries of the world.
                                Greece and Turkey did not hesitate to point out that the 6 should
                                certainly become the 8 when they discuss gaps and that special
                                consideration had to be given to Greece and Turkey. Grewe (Germany)
                                repeated the German position that the discussion should start in the
                                EEC with non-members added. He did not mention the <gloss

                                talked about the responsibility of the <gloss target="#t_OECD1"

                                <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName>'s remarks stressed the
                                necessity to have a common definition of the problem, which is
                                extremely complex involving many interrelated economic, social and
                                technological factors. He agreed that much of the action will have
                                to be taken in Europe, and assured NATO members that the US stands
                                ready to cooperate. In addition to the role that NATO can play in
                                the area of defense technology, <persName corresp="#p_BRR1"
                                    >Bowie</persName> underlined the fact that other international
                                organizations have competence in different aspects of the over-all

                                sharpen the focus of the Europeans on the gap problem. Although
                                there was not a deep discussion of substance, it was nevertheless
                                clear that movement so far seems to be in the right direction—the
                                direction of Europe. The recognition by the Europeans that the
                                problem, and its origins, are basically theirs seems to reflect
                                conclusion that the more responsible thinkers on this subject are so
                                far resisting the temptation to give it an anti-American twist.
                                Accordingly, our current posture of standing ready to be helpful but
                                not forcing the pace seems to be the right one.</item>

                                    President, <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName> raised
                                    the idea of a mission to Europe to discuss technology gap
                                    issues. (Ibid.) He explained that since November 1966, when he
                                    had been named to chair the interagency committee studying the
                                    problem, the Europeans had been expecting a visit, an idea that
                                    was supported by the State Department. Prior to his departure on

                                    the President's Special Assistant, Marvin Watson, on the issues
                                    and included a request: “Since it is a tight rope walk, I would
                                    very much like to meet very briefly with the President to get
                                    his point of view so I can take a stance which coincides with

                            technological gap remains high. However, there has been a healthy shift
                            in emphasis. Last year European political leaders seemed to feel the
                            United States had developed a mysterious technique for moving ahead in
                            science and technology which Europe could not match. They (e.g.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FA5">Fanfani</persName> of Italy and Harmel of
                            Belgium) called on the United States to restore the balance. Today, they
                            see the problem more clearly as one of putting technological knowledge
                            rapidly to effective use. They recognize that all of the major factors
                            are ones they must deal with themselves, and there is no longer talk of
                            a “Marshall Plan for technology.” But a deep uneasiness remains. There
                            is a quite general feeling of having to defend themselves against the
                            American colossus. They still want a “helping hand.”</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Two favorable developments</hi> have resulted from the
                            heightened political interest in the technological gap. First, all the
                            countries have stepped up the amount of resources devoted to higher
                            education and to scientific research and development, some of them
                            dramatically. Second, there is a growing feeling that European industry
                            must be restructured on a continental scale, including the U.K., to get

                            expressed, for example, that a major modern State must have an

                            Concern was expressed about extra-territorial controls resulting either
                            from decisions taken in the home office in the United States affecting
                            investment and employment policies of European subsidiaries or from the
                            various U.S. Government rules and regulations applicable to transactions
                            of subsidiaries in Europe by reason of the control of the parent company
                            in the United States (e.g., trade with Eastern Europe). Of course, their
                            economists generally agree with us that from a purely economic
                            standpoint we all do best by letting the most efficient source provide
                            new technology, no matter where it is.</p>
                        <p>The critical policy issue to be faced by these countries, therefore, is
                            the economic price they want to pay for such independence of national
                            operations. It is clear that they are willing to pay some price, and
                            this could lead to discriminatory measures against U.S.
                            corporations.</p>
                        <p>The Europeans feel they will ultimately find a European solution to their
                            problems. Their principal concern is that this may be a slow process and
                            in the interim American industry will securely establish itself in the
                            lead in the key technologically advanced sectors and control important
                            elements of the European economy.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">U.S. posture</hi> of refraining from taking
                            initiatives—and of friendly cooperation—has proved to be successful.
                            However, the fear within Europe of U.S. domination in key European
                            industries is a source of political strain. There are undercurrents of
                            concern on this issue in certain countries that could damage our
                            political and commercial ties with Europe.</p>

                            international agreement. It would (1) be a guide to good citizenship of

                        <p>It was my general impression that in all of the six countries visited

                            real appreciation of the concern by the U.S. for their problem and the

                        <p>The Prime Minister said that there was widespread talk in Belgium and all
                            of Europe that the technological gap between the United States and
                            Europe was increasing and was becoming very dangerous. Sometime ago
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> made a speech
                            saying that it was not the intent of the United States to broaden that
                            gap but that speech came at a moment when public opinion in Europe was
                            not prepared to understand it and it did not produce much effect. At
                            present public opinion is much more alive to the problem and if
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> were, again, to
                            make a speech along the same lines and in particular to say that he
                            urged American firms investing in Europe to carry out technically
                            advanced production in Europe so as to close rather than increase the
                            gap, this would have the most salutary effect. The Secretary said that
                            indeed the United States does not seek to increase the gap and it is
                            possible that a statement of this kind may be made. It is important,
                            however, that as at the time when the Marshall Plan was first announced,
                            there should be European leadership in evidence to show that the
                            Europeans are interested in cooperating with the United States in
                            narrowing the technological gap. The Prime Minister agreed <pb n="28"
                                xml:id="pg_28" facs="0058"/>with this point of view that European
                            leadership can and should be forthcoming. The Secretary said that he
                            would report this conversation to the President immediately upon his
                            return and that he would suggest that the Prime Minister might direct a
                            personal message to the President on this subject. The President would
                            certainly be most interested in receiving such a communication.</p>

                        <p>Attached is a report of the “Technological Gap Committee”<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d14fn2">Not attached; see <ref target="#d15">Document
                                    15</ref>.</note> you asked me to chair just a year ago. Your
                            request came after the “Gap” had been raised during the visits of
                            several Heads of State. At that time it had acquired political and
                            emotional significance—for example, in the <persName corresp="#p_FA5"
                                >Fanfani</persName> suggestion of a Technological Marshall Plan.</p>
                        <p>Although the issue has subsequently been raised from time to time (e.g.,
                            by Prime Ministers <persName corresp="#p_WC1">Wilson</persName> and
                            Harmel), the “low-key” strategy suggested in our preliminary report last
                            January has paid off handsomely. The analyses carried out in <gloss
                                target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>, NATO and EC agree with each other
                            and with this report as to what is involved—education, management,
                            markets, etc.—and much of the heat has come off.</p>
                        <p>For the present, the mystique has gone out of the “Gap.” But we should
                            not be deceived into thinking the problem has gone away. Europeans now
                            understand it, but they have yet to solve it. As they feel the hot
                            breath of American competition, the pressure for us to “do something”
                            will likely increase again. This view seems to be borne out by the
                            December 13th cable from Brussels from Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> pointing to rising concern.</p>
                        <p>Although we suggest many small steps, big steps can only be taken in
                            Europe. However, the steps we suggest do add up to a constructive
                            response, and I consider it important that we take such steps as are
                            feasible at regular intervals so as to maintain a posture of concern and
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>A very important move in that direction is a proposal on its way to you
                            from the Bureau of the Budget that government-purchased <pb n="29"

                            internationally established standards.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that you approve the actions outlined in the Committee's

                        <p>We submitted a preliminary report in January 1967 and subsequently have
                            completed a detailed analysis of the problem including a survey of

                        <p>In our study, we have started from the proposition that the expansion of
                            technological capability and freer exchange of technology on both sides
                            of the Atlantic can be to the mutual advantage of the U.S. and Western
                            Europe and, indeed, the entire world.</p>
                        <p rend="center">THE “TECHNOLOGICAL GAP”</p>
                        <p>The problem of the “technological gap” is only partly technological.
                            Psychological, political, economic, and social factors are probably more
                            important. <list>
                                <item>—The European lag in technological know-how is largely in a
                                    few sectors of advanced technology, principally those that have
                                    benefited from U.S. military, space, and atomic energy
                                    programs—computers, advanced aircraft, microminiature electronic
                                    components, civil nuclear power, space communications.</item>
                                <item>—Although Europeans are concerned about the long-term national
                                    implications of these technological disparities, they also
                                    recognize the existence of an economically more significant lag
                                    in European industrial abilities to utilize available
                                    technology. For example, many inventions made in Europe were
                                    first introduced commercially in the U.S.</item>
                                <item>—The European lag in the utilization of technological know-how
                                    is due to a number of long-standing structural factors that only
                                    the European countries themselves can overcome, including:
                                    underinvestment in education; less aggressive and skilled
                                    management; less profit-oriented social customs and work habits;
                                    slowness in industrial modernization; small size of firms and
                                    national markets; conservative investment attitudes; and lack of
                                    mobility and inadequate number of highly trained
                                    personnel.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>This general view of the situation is now widely shared by informed
                            European leaders. It represents a marked change in their understanding
                            during the past year.</p>
                        <p>In our view, the technological gap problem is a current manifestation of
                            the historical differences between Europe and the U.S. in aggressiveness
                            and dynamism, reflecting the American frontier past and its restless
                            quest for progress and change.</p>
                        <p rend="center">The Problem for the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Improved European understanding of the nature of the technological gap
                            has already led to some corrective steps, both nationally and
                            European-wide—a constructive response to American competitive
                            pressures.</p>
                        <p>However, many Europeans are concerned that during the time they are
                            taking corrective actions the U.S. will move further ahead of them in
                            advanced <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0061"/>technological
                            development and industrial innovation, and will capture greater control
                            of world markets for advanced technological products. This concern has
                            been sharpened by the very rapid growth of American direct investments
                            in the technology-intensive industries of Western Europe.</p>
                        <p>Some Europeans are also concerned that major decisions affecting the
                            future of European industry, and even their national independence, may
                            not be in their hands. They feel they may be undesirably influenced by
                            American corporate decisions and by U.S. governmental trade and
                            financial controls. Other Europeans recognize that American investment
                            has been a highly valuable force in moving their economies forward.</p>
                        <p>As we see it, the technological gap issue is one aspect of the broad
                            disparities in power and economic strength between the U.S. and a
                            fragmented Europe which will be a recurrent problem for a long time to
                            come. The frictions caused by these general disparities will continue,
                            and will take different forms—economic and political—from time to
                            time.</p>
                        <p>Although European concerns about the technological gap may be
                            exaggerated, they may nonetheless result in European counteractions to
                            discriminate against American firms or products and in other measures
                            that would pose political and economic difficulties for the U.S.</p>
                        <p>However, we believe that the adoption of restrictive measures by Western
                            European countries and ensuing pressures for countermeasures by the U.S.
                            can be deterred (if not prevented) by: (a) a continuing long-range
                            program of U.S. actions designed to show our cooperativeness, our desire
                            to promote European advance, and our willingness to remove obstacles to
                            the exchange of technology, and (b) the self-interest of European
                            countries and their firms in maintaining the flow of American technology
                            and management skills.</p>
                        <p rend="center">U.S. Strategy</p>
                        <p>The only long-range “cure” for the disparities problem lies in actions
                            which must be taken by Europeans themselves: internal reforms in the
                            European countries and moves toward greater European integration and
                            cooperation.</p>
                        <p>There is little that the U.S. government can or should do by way of
                            direct assistance. But, the U.S. can play a significant complementary
                            role—primarily through promoting scientific and technological
                            cooperation and through the mutual reduction of obstacles to the flow of
                            technology and related trade.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, we should maximize both the short-term and long-term
                            economic benefits to the U.S. from the transfer of technology. We should
                            utilize our technological position to achieve the objectives set forth
                            in this report.</p>

                        <p>Events of the past year have confirmed the soundness of the overall
                            strategy recommended in our report of last January. Although we should
                            look mainly to European initiatives, the U.S. should provide a positive
                            response to European concerns.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. should try to convert European resentment about the
                            technological gap into a constructive source of support for greater
                            intra-European cooperation for solving the underlying problems. At the
                            same time, we should discourage parochial solutions and attempt to
                            ensure an outward-looking Europe which will be a strong force in the
                            world economy.</p>

                                    the basic actions to strengthen Europe must be taken by the

                            of major initiatives or direct assistance, since the only long-range
                            “cure” lies in actions which must be taken by Europeans themselves.</p>

                            Communities.</p>
                        <p>There is now widespread agreement among Europeans that the “gap” is
                            principally a lag in the utilization of technological know-how due to a
                            number of factors—education, management, markets, etc., as well as
                            technology. This was evident at the <gloss target="#t_OECD1"
                                >OECD</gloss> Ministers of Science meeting which I attended on March
                            11 and 12. European attention appears to be shifting from “gaps” to
                            creating the conditions needed to relate technological developments to
                            progress.</p>
                        <p>While the committee report recognizes that the big steps needed to
                            improve European industrial performance can only be taken in Europe, it
                            urges that the U.S. make a positive response to European concerns—to
                            deter the possible adoption of restrictive measures against American
                            firms in Europe and to maximize the economic benefits to the U.S. from
                            the transfer of technology.</p>
                        <p>To implement the foregoing strategy, the report proposes a number of
                            steps (Attachment A): <list>

                            the Technological Gap, and have helped dissipate the political pressures
                            which tended to dominate the early stages of the debate on this

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> Science Ministerial meeting,
                            which was held March 11–12, 1968, constituted another major step in this
                            progression. The most important results of this meeting, attended not
                            only by science and education ministers, but also by some ministers of
                            economics and industry, were: (1) a clear endorsement of the results of
                            the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> studies, which in most
                            respects parallel the conclusions presented in the Report to the
                            President; (2) a consensus that national and joint action on the part of
                            Europeans will be required as the principal contribution to
                            technological progress in Europe; (3) a general political relaxation and
                            a turning away from a “blame the U.S.” philosophy to a more realistic
                            intra-European introspection. Evidence is thus at hand that the U.S.
                            strategy first enunciated in the Preliminary Report to the President in
                            January 1967, and further detailed in the final report of December 22,
                            1967, has been and is successful in dealing with the problems engendered
                            by the Technological Gap.</p>
                        <p>It is my view that most of the recommendations and tasks enumerated in
                            Annex A<note n="3" xml:id="d18fn3">Reference is to the attached
                                report.</note> are being pursued in an orderly fashion by
                            appropriate government agencies. I am satisfied that the present efforts
                            in these areas are sufficient to meet U.S. needs and see no need to
                            inject a sense of urgency into the studies and actions now underway. I
                            would suggest that studies underway be continued and remain principally
                            directed at their original aims. Those items requiring additional
                            comments are as follows: <list>

                            recommendation that for the present it be kept to a minimum.</p>

                        <p>The report of the Interdepartmental Committee on the Technological Gap
                            makes a significant contribution to the understanding of the subject.
                            This Mission is in complete accord with the conclusion that the
                            technological gap is only to a very limited degree a question of
                            technological leads and lags. It clearly was the presence of political,
                            psychological and economic considerations that enhanced the danger that
                            the gap might develop into a divisive force of considerable importance
                            in our relations with Western Europe.</p>
                        <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0072"/>
                        <p>Due in large measure to United States willingness to cooperate in
                            investigating the causes and effects of the gap in the <gloss
                                target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> and NATO, and as a result of the
                            educational process that also took place, much of the sensitivity
                            surrounding the issue has been removed. It is apparent that the subject
                            no longer arouses the strong emotions that it did, as recently as a year
                            ago.</p>
                        <p>The Mission, therefore, believes there would be little advantage in
                            making public an appropriately edited version of the report at this
                            time. Issuance of an official high-level report on the gap, even in a
                            heavily edited version, might only serve to bring the issue once again
                            to the forefront of the political arena, and we believe it best that it
                            remains quiescent.</p>

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName>'s final report to the
                            President is an excellent study of the problems which comprise the
                            Technological Gap issue. It is particularly valuable in that it analyses
                            the Gap in terms of a very broad variety of inter-related problems some
                            of which, heretofore, have been approached largely on a piecemeal,
                            sector-by-sector basis.</p>
                        <p>A substantial number of the points brought out in the report were very
                            effectively presented by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HDF1"
                                >Hornig</persName> and members of his delegations during the several
                            major <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> science policy meetings of
                            the <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0073"/>past three years. As a direct
                            result, many French government and industrial leaders were brought to a
                            more realistic understanding of the nature of the problems and the fact
                            that their resolution (or amelioration) cannot be dependent upon some
                            form of American largesse but, at base, must be approached in terms of
                            structural reforms to be carried out by the Europeans themselves.</p>
                        <p>This broadening awareness has certainly played a large part in vitiating
                            the shrill and relatively uninformed political outcry which
                            characterized initial European approaches to the Technological Gap
                            issue. However, with the subsidence of that initial round of European
                            agitation on the Gap issue, it has become all too easy for us to lose
                            sight of a basic fact—the problem in Europe remains.</p>
                        <p>Many of the underlying causes of the Technological Gap (inflexible and
                            outmoded educational system and managerial practices, lack of innovative
                            climate, severely limited mobility of highly trained personnel, etc.)
                            were among the very factors which led to the May–June upheavals in
                            French universities, government laboratories and high technology
                            industries. These demonstrations cogently pointed up the magnitude and
                            severity of the unresolved problems facing France in these and other
                            areas.</p>
                        <p>Protracted and searching confrontations and discussions during and since
                            the May–June events have brought to surface and underscored the
                            formidable difficulties the French face in their attempts to determine
                            and successfully implement fundamental reforms which can meet their
                            problems. Although some intensive efforts are underway within the French
                            Government to devise new and effective reforms, the prospect of
                            significant near-term successes appears, at best, highly doubtful. There
                            is, in fact, a distinct possibility that failure to achieve timely
                            results in line with expectations could bring the government under
                            renewed pressures. Since some French leaders might then find it
                            difficult to resist a search for scapegoats, a new wave of Technological
                            Gap agitation could result with the United States again cast as the
                            villain of the piece.</p>
                        <p>Such a prospect was foreshadowed only a few days ago when <persName>M.
                                Lattes</persName>, Managing Director of METRA, the largest French
                            computer service organization operating under “Plan Calcul,” expressed
                            the firm belief that the Gap is going to increase rapidly during the
                            next ten years and will become a major divisive force separating the
                            United States and Europe. Lattés, who is active in top advisory

                            on <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0074"/>the Gap and spoke of it in
                            highly emotional terms. In another recent conversation, M. Wacrenier, a
                            senior member of the DGRST, pointed out that, on conclusion of the
                            present crash efforts to meet the more immediate crisis problems, he
                            believed that the Technological Gap question could quite possibly
                            receive fresh emphasis.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister Debré himself, at his first Foreign Ministry staff
                            meeting only a few days ago, demonstrated anew his deep concern
                            regarding the presence and role of U.S. industrial firms in Europe.
                            According to Quai Director of American Affairs Jurgensen, after
                            identifying “Le Defi Americain” as one of the principal “dangers”
                            confronting France, Debré went on to expound at length on the
                            Servan-Schreiber economic and financial theme that U.S. industry in
                            Europe constitutes the threat to European independence. (See Embtel

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName>'s report is a national
                            policy paper cast largely in terms of U.S. interests. Consequently, we
                            feel that it would not be suitable in its present form for open
                            publication or presentation to French officials. However, the French
                            Government's intensive search for solutions has created an atmosphere of
                            potential interest among French leaders in constructive analyses of just
                            this nature. These leaders, some of whom only recently came to their
                            jobs with the new government, thus constitute something of a ready-made
                            audience.</p>
                        <p>We believe that this affords an opportunity to employ to advantage the
                            background study on Gap now in preparation in the Department of
                            Commerce. Assuming that it covers—and may expand upon—those elements of
                            the <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName> report which describe
                            and analyze causes of the European lag in utilization of technological
                            know-how, we recommend that it be completed on a timely basis and made
                            available to the Embassy for selective presentation to key French
                            government and industrial leaders. As an objective, analytical
                            background study, that paper could be given a serious and appreciative
                            reception within the French Government. Since the appearance of an
                            American <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName> report is

                        <p>If, in the light of that discussion, you should decide that the US should

                            unmanned flight projects to support a manned lunar landing. The effort
                            should begin with the exchange of data already obtained and with joint
                            planning of future flight missions to secure additional data in the

                        <p>While we cannot forecast the Soviet response in advance, and adequate
                            implementation requires a change in the Soviet attitude with respect to
                            disclosure of information with regard to program plans and results, I
                            believe this proposal constitutes a practical step which goes as far as
                            we should prudently go in the light of our own national interests. If
                            such a cooperative project were satisfactorily under way, more advanced
                            proposals could be considered.</p>

                                Academy of Sciences for cooperation in three areas: (1) coordinated
                                meteorological satellite program; (2) passive communications

                                    >NASA</gloss> in regard to the agreements between us, has failed

                                Bank Observatory. Other tests of Soviet intentions under these

                            <item>The report focuses upon possible cooperation in manned and related
                                unmanned lunar programs. (Possibilities for cooperation in other
                                space programs have been and will continue to be advanced in the
                                channel between <gloss target="#t_NASA1">NASA</gloss> and the Soviet

                            <item>The report recommends these guidelines to govern foreseeable
                                negotiations with the Soviet Union in the space field: substantive
                                rather than propaganda objectives alone; well-defined and comparable
                                obligations for both sides; freedom to take independent action;
                                protection of national and military security interests; opportunity
                                for participation by friendly nations; and open dissemination of
                                scientific results.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>The report recognizes that cooperation with the Soviet Union must
                                ultimately rest on specific projects. However, the advantages and
                                disadvantages of specific proposals are not absolute. They may vary
                                significantly, depending upon Soviet objectives, techniques,
                                procedures, and schedules relative to ours. Lacking sufficient
                                information of these factors, we remain uncertain of the security
                                and tactical aspects of specific proposals which might be advanced
                                to the Soviets.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>
                                <p>Accordingly, the report outlines a preferred structured approach
                                    calculated to determine a level of confidence in any Soviet
                                    response, to gain information on basic elements of the Soviet
                                    program, and to merit confidence and support by the public and
                                    the Congress.</p>
                                <p>Briefly, this approach provides for maximum exchange of past
                                    results (generally subject to verification from other US
                                    sources), proceeds then to sufficient disclosure of the future
                                    planning of both sides to identify areas favorable for

                                <p>The report recognizes that the Soviet Union is unlikely to be
                                    amenable to such an approach. In that case, it would be possible
                                    to proceed directly to specific proposals. Some 15 examples of
                                    possible projects are described in the report and evaluated in
                                    such terms as our current knowledge of the Soviet program
                                    permits.</p>
                                <p>However, limitations (described in the report) attach to
                                    virtually all these proposals. These limitations reflect the
                                    general climate of US-Soviet relations and are therefore subject
                                    to change—which might bring any of the proposals within the
                                    range of realistic negotiation. At present, a change in
                                    sentiment appears necessary even for small steps in cooperation;
                                    for example, in the exchange of purely scientific data relating
                                    to solar radiation and micrometeorites, the Soviet Union has
                                    within the past year declined to provide details of
                                    instrumentation and calibration required for their
                                    understanding. Given a change in sentiment, however, such
                                    exchanges would be useful and some cooperation might be proposed
                                    and developed in several areas including those listed below and,
                                    in addition, mutual tracking support and the recovery and return
                                    of manned capsules after their return to earth.</p>

                            <item>On balance, the most realistic and constructive group of proposals
                                which might be advanced to the Soviet Union, with due regard for the

                                report, relates to a joint program of unmanned flight projects to
                                support a manned lunar landing. These projects should be linked so
                                far as possible to a step-by-step approach, ranging from exchange of
                                data already obtained to joint planning of future flight missions.

                                <p>The implications of exploration and use of outer space in the
                                    1970's indicate clearly that, from the viewpoint of its national
                                    security in the broadest sense, the United States must continue
                                    an active space program. This program should place its main
                                    emphasis on broadening our horizon of knowledge and breadth of
                                    competence in this new medium, with particular attention both to
                                    the political implications of our achievements measured against

                                        competitive race in the 1970's. An evaluation should be made
                                        of the long-run political potential for altering the
                                            US–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relationship by
                                        such a dramatic development. In this connection, even a
                                        joint effort to make a lunar landing should not be excluded.
                                        This evaluation would, of course, have to take into account
                                        the fact that political assets accruing to the United States
                                        in the event of our making the first lunar landing would be
                                        sizeable, and that formidable and possibly prohibitive
                                        technical problems would be involved in a joint
                                        effort.</item>

                            Secretary of the Space Council, the Director of Central Intelligence,
                            the Science Advisor, and certain of my staff. This report presents a
                            reasonable and persuasive approach to a program of cooperation with the
                            Soviet Union in the field of outer space.</p>
                        <p>The report and recommendations therein have my general endorsement and I
                            hereby request you in cooperation with the other responsible officers of
                            the Government, particularly the Secretary of State and the Executive
                            Secretary of the Space Council, to proceed with this program keeping me
                            informed of progress and calling upon me for such help as I may be able
                            to offer.</p>

                            continuing review, and to keep me currently advised of the progress
                            being made with the Soviet Academy under the current agreement, and also
                            of any Soviet response to our initiatives at the United Nations on
                            cooperation in outer space.</p>
                        <p>By the first of May, the Soviet Union should have had ample opportunity
                            to make its intentions with respect to cooperation clear to us. I will
                            expect you to assume the initiative in preparing appropriate
                            recommendations for my attention to deal with the situation as it
                            appears to be at that time.</p>
                        <p>The Executive Secretary of the Space Council has suggested that the
                            report be used as the basis for a briefing at some appropriate time for
                            members of the Space Council. By copy of this memorandum I request him
                            to work with you in developing this briefing and setting a time
                            therefor.</p>

                        <p>This Memorandum, prepared as a contribution to a forthcoming National
                            Intelligence Estimate, is being circulated more widely because of

                        <p>In general Soviet policy toward outer space is likely to remain
                            conservative. The Soviets seem likely to move slowly in a field whose
                            potentialities remain to be explored, being careful not to freeze
                            themselves out of potential technical or military advantages. They will
                            probably wish to keep their agreements for cooperation with the US and
                            other foreign countries carefully limited, lest they undertake
                            obligations which may later prove onerous. They have privately come to
                            accept spaceborne reconnaissance as a fact of life, but have not yet
                            publicly acknowledged its legality. They may in the future decide to do
                            so, and thereby attempt to turn the legitimacy of satellite
                            reconnaissance to their own advantage.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union tends to look upon outer space as the preserve of the
                            great powers, and upon its successes there as an important hallmark of
                            national greatness. The Soviets probably believe that spectacular
                            achievements in space exploration are destined to be the distinguishing
                            marks of the great powers to an even greater extent than possession of
                            nuclear weapons. They probably see in their space program not only
                            opportunities for enhancing their prestige (using both scientific
                            achievement and military power as the criteria) but also may see some
                            room for cooperation with the US in a field which emphasizes the unique
                            role of the world's two super powers.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Obviously, Soviet space activities have been expensive. And at the same
                            time allocation of economic resources to new investment has been a major
                            problem in Soviet internal affairs. However, it does not necessarily
                            follow that the Soviet space program will be cut back for lack <pb
                                n="58" xml:id="pg_58" facs="0088"/>of funds. Though resource
                            allocation decisions have involved difficult choices, Moscow is not so
                            strapped that it is deprived of choices. Later on in the decade Soviet
                            economic strains may decrease, and in the interim the Soviets apparently
                            wish to do at least enough to keep their options open.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet attitude toward a manned lunar landing appears to be much
                            along these lines. Some of <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>'s remarks have raised the question of whether
                            Moscow might be bowing out of the space race because of the expense
                            involved. Read carefully, <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>'s statements on the subject reveal an artful
                            vagueness. He has rejected competition in suicidal efforts, but has not
                            ruled out the possibility that it might be a Soviet astronaut who makes
                            the first successful trip to the moon and back again. Even while making
                            this qualified rejection of competition <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> did state that Soviet programs in preparation
                            for a moon flight were continuing. We believe that until such time as
                            they may be assured of success, the Soviets will probably refrain from
                            stating an open challenge to be the first to the moon. But the absence
                            of an explicit Soviet challenge does not necessarily mean that they have
                            given up hope of being the first to make the trip.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">Prospects for Space Cooperation</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Past practice suggests that the Soviets will be more interested in ad
                            hoc, bilateral ventures than in multilateral arrangements in space
                            cooperation. The few cooperative space projects which the Soviets have
                            thus far agreed to undertake with the US have several features in
                            common. Key elements in the acceptability of the proposals were that (1)
                            they involve no infringement of Soviet security, (2) they are
                            demonstrably “peaceful,” i.e., non-military in character, (3) they are
                            non-competitive in the sense that they involve no revelation of
                            fundamental technological weakness or strength by either side, and (4)
                            they are not very important, at least from the point of view of
                            contributing much to the space capabilities of either side. To the
                            extent that the information to be exchanged is useful, both sides would
                            gain equally. The fact that neither would be dependent on the other,
                            however, for data essential for progress in its own national space
                            program, clearly simplified the matter of agreement.</p>
                        <p>Cooperation in any major venture—certainly any as major as manned space
                            flight—goes well beyond the above considerations, however. For even such
                            a relatively simple proposal as the exchange of astronauts, for example,
                            the Soviets would have to reveal rather full details of flight
                            techniques, life support systems, and space capsule characteristics, as
                            well as characteristics of their launch vehicles themselves. Similarly,
                            any consideration of use of shared tracking facilities would require
                            some infringement of Soviet security.</p>
                        <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59" facs="0089"/>
                        <p>Furthermore, any full exchange of data would inevitably require an
                            admission of Soviet shortcomings and space failures—which they have not
                            yet even tacitly admitted. The Soviets have been extremely sensitive on
                            this subject thus far, and are not likely in the future to wish to lead
                            from a position of weakness.</p>
                        <p>In light of the foregoing considerations, certain specific fields for
                            future cooperation are likely to appear more attractive to the Soviets
                            than others. Meteorology, for example, is likely to continue to be a
                            field where further cooperation will be possible. Communications
                            satellites, on the other hand, will probably not appear worthwhile to
                            the Soviets from an economic standpoint, although a cooperative
                            arrangement could probably be developed which would not infringe on
                            Soviet security considerations.</p>
                        <p>Other space projects where cooperation with the US might be economically
                            advantageous to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> include such
                            fields as mapping, geodesy, and navigation. The obvious military
                            applications of each of these fields, however, would tend to make the
                            Soviets shy away from much, if any, joint activity with the US. We
                            therefore think it unlikely that they will decide to undertake any of
                            them with us in the near term.</p>
                        <p>Thus as they consider each potential step to be taken in the future, the
                            Soviets will probably weigh strategic implications, whether they can
                            expect a net gain—or at least no net loss—in technology, and the
                            financial costs. Given their concerns, the Soviets are more likely to
                            continue to be responsive to specific limited propositions (which give
                            them a built in assurance of the limits of their commitment and
                            obligations before they make a decision), rather than cooperative
                            programs for larger-scale space endeavors.</p>
                        <p>In sum, the Soviets may see political advantages in future space
                            cooperation with the US, but we think it unlikely that they will wish to
                            cooperate in projects which they consider prejudicial to their security
                            or which involve major investments.</p>

                        <p>The Soviet Union will probably continue to value consultations with the
                            US on space law which also stress the unique roles of the US and <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in this field. The Soviets will
                            almost certainly revert from time to time to attempts to exploit
                            discussions of space law in order to score propaganda points. However,
                            the secular trend is probably in the direction of a series of small
                            agreements covering such matters as assistance and return of distressed
                            astronauts and spacecraft. Moscow will nevertheless continue to be
                            conservative in space law questions, and will probably move slowly in
                            freezing legal definitions in a new field in which the totality of
                            Soviet interests may not yet be clear. For <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60"
                                facs="0090"/>example, the Soviets may remain reluctant to agree to a
                            legal definition of outer space for some time.</p>
                        <p>Moscow has already concluded one arms control agreement affecting outer
                            space—viz. the UN General Assembly resolution on not orbiting nuclear
                                weapons.<note n="2" xml:id="d27fn2">Reference is to General Assembly

                            the extent they have no pressing military requirements, they may seek
                            other declaratory agreements barring further military uses of space. The
                            Soviet preference for declaratory agreements appears likely to rest both
                            upon the desire to establish precedents applicable to terrestrial
                            disarmament, and upon a reluctance to reveal military technology. The
                            Soviet preference is not, however, absolute. Moscow has agreed in
                            principle to the use of satellites as part of control systems to monitor
                            nuclear tests in space, and might return again to the idea of
                            space-borne control systems.</p>

                        <p>Moscow's public position is that reconnaissance satellites are illegal.
                            Heretofore, the Soviets have argued that espionage was a violation of
                            international law and could not be legitimized by a new choice of
                            locale. There are, however, signs that this position may be changing.
                            The Soviet Union is developing a satellite reconnaissance program of its
                            own which it presumably must protect. Moreover, recently <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> and lesser Soviet officials
                            have indicated that the existence of reconnaissance satellites obviates
                            the need for other disarmament controls and make unnecessary US
                            overflights of Cuba.</p>
                        <p>So far all of the Soviet statements indicating Soviet possession of a
                            satellite reconnaissance capability or a degree of willingness to
                            recognize satellite reconnaissance as legitimate have been made in
                            private conversations and have not been published in Soviet media. As a
                            tactical matter, if they found themselves pressed publicly on the issue
                            in the near future, the Soviets might return to restating their standing
                            public position that satellite reconnaissance is illegal. Given the
                            general unresponsiveness of UN members to this issue, we doubt that such
                            an approach would be fruitful for Moscow. At any rate, we believe that
                            sooner or later—in part depending upon the degree to which they may have
                            restated their old charges of illegality—they will find it more
                            productive to turn the international acceptance of satellite
                            reconnaissance to their own advantage. They may then generate proposals
                            advocating the use of observation satellites—to the exclusion of all
                            other means of inspection—to monitor disarmament agreements.</p>
                        <p>Whether, in an even longer term, Moscow may conclude that the existence
                            of satellite reconnaissance has so degraded key forms of <pb n="61"
                                xml:id="pg_61" facs="0091"/>military secrecy that it would be in the
                            Soviet interest to accept a controlled general disarmament arrangement
                            remains highly problematical. It would still involve revelation of a
                            substantial amount of military technology, it would still require a
                            politically intrusive inspection system, and the terms of the agreement
                            would still be the subject of long and difficult negotiations.</p>

                            limitations necessarily lead to concentration on current commitments at
                            the possible expense of longer-range programs. Between the criteria of

                            Apollo-related programs we may be overlooking some important areas of
                            research.</p>
                        <p>In the case of space propulsion, for example, the imminent abandonment of
                            Project Orion may be disquieting. This particular project involves only
                            one of several advanced techniques for space propulsion, and has not
                            been demonstrated thus far to be among the most advantageous to them.
                            Nonetheless it is one of the areas in which a quantum jump in space
                            technology is possible by either side and may constitute an option which
                            should not have to be foreclosed. There may be other similar
                            instances.</p>
                        <p>We have not fully recovered from the blow to our prestige, and the burden
                            imposed on our diplomacy by the Soviet sputniks and luniks and orbiting
                            manned-space vehicles, as USIA polls of foreign opinion on the relative
                            military strengths of <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and USA
                            continue to attest.</p>
                        <p>We must continue to be concerned by the possibility not only of a
                            significant breakthrough by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in
                            military technology in space, but of dramatic advances which boost
                            Soviet prestige, and damage ours, even if they do not gravely affect the
                            military balance.</p>
                        <p>You are familiar with the President's general observations, made in St.
                            Louis on October 21, on one of the ten ways to fight communism: “by
                            maintaining superiority in every field of science and technology which
                            does or can affect the security of the Nation. This applies to the
                            exploration of outer space. We dare not leave this area of our universe
                            to become a monopoly in the hands of those who would destroy freedom. We
                            must therefore obtain and maintain a leadership for the Free World in
                            outer space and we are trying to do that.”<note n="4" xml:id="d28fn4"

                                >USSR</gloss>. In addition, the letter reviewed Soviet performance
                            and attitudes and, conditional on Soviet demonstration of a desire to
                            fulfill existing commitments, recommended that the United States adopt
                            as positive an approach toward the next confrontation between Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DHL1">Dryden</persName> and Academician

                            program requirements would permit.</p>
                        <p>The Second Memorandum of Understanding, agreed at Geneva on June 6, was
                            to go into effect if neither side took exception to its provisions by
                            July 6. We had no substantive changes to suggest but did request the
                            correction of some editorial discrepancies between the English and
                            Russian texts. Academician <persName corresp="#p_BAA3"
                                >Blagonravov</persName> wrote that the Soviets could not accept
                            certain provisions of the Memorandum relating to the joint review of
                            space biology and medicine. These were the provisions for parallel
                            chapters by Soviet and American authors, each reviewing the work done in
                            his own country. Instead, the Soviet side reverted to its initial
                            position at Geneva that either Soviet or American authors undertake to
                            review the work of both sides on various subjects. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DHL1">Dryden</persName> proposed continued discussion of
                            the space biology and medicine project in New York during the October
                            meetings of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer

                            <persName corresp="#p_BAA3">Blagonravov</persName> accepted this
                            suggestion.</p>
                        <p>Although he agreed readily to continued discussion, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BAA3">Blagonravov</persName> failed to confirm
                            acceptance of the editorial changes necessary to establish the status of
                            the remaining sections of the Second Memorandum. We insisted that such
                            confirmation was necessary before the United States could consider in
                            effect those sections of the Second Memorandum of Understanding which
                            provide for the exchange of magnetic field and conventional
                            meteorological data. The necessary assurances came by telegram on
                            October 23, thus clearing the way for the exchange of conventional data
                            over the communications link established under the Protocol of June
                            6.</p>
                        <p>With the interested agencies concurring, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_DHL1"
                                >Dryden</persName> decided that should the Soviets, in the October
                            meeting, maintain their opposition to parallel reviews of space biology
                            and medicine, he would propose as a compromise that Soviet and American
                            specialists prepare and <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0095"/>submit
                            equivalent background material for each agreed chapter. With this raw
                            material in hand, a Joint Editorial Board would assign to a single
                            author, either Soviet or American, the actual task of preparing each
                            chapter for publication. This procedure would satisfy the American
                            concern that there be an equivalent exchange of data; it would assure
                            the availability of Soviet data to American authors; and it would meet
                            the Soviet objection to parallel chapters.</p>
                        <p>In addition, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_DHL1">Dryden</persName> proposed
                            an exchange of visits by expert teams to deep space tracking stations
                            and an exchange of data which might result from 1964 Mars missions.</p>
                        <p>In the New York meeting, the agreed portions of the Second Memorandum of
                            Understanding were signed on November 5 and submitted through the
                            respective Missions to the UN to the Secretary-General of the United
                            Nations. No agreement was reached on the space biology and medicine
                            project. The Soviets rejected the American compromise proposal and
                            continued to insist that authors be assigned at once without any
                            assurance that Soviet data would be made available to American authors
                            and, indeed, with no mechanism for making it available. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DHL1">Dryden</persName> explained that the United States
                            position was flexible in detail but that no agreement would be possible
                            that did not provide a sound prospect of an exchange of equivalent data.
                            The American representatives offered to elucidate their position in
                            writing for further Soviet consideration, and this has since been done
                            by means of a <persName corresp="#p_DHL1">Dryden</persName>-to-<persName
                                corresp="#p_BAA3">Blagonravov</persName> letter of December 2.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BAA3">Blagonravov</persName> accepted in principle
                            the proposal for an exchange of visits to deep space tracking stations
                            but suggested that the detailed arrangements be left to correspondence.
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_DHL1">Dryden</persName> has since pursued this
                            suggestion in a letter of December 8, outlining a plan for reciprocal
                            visits by Soviet and American teams to the stations at Goldstone,
                            California, and at Yevpatoriya in the Crimea. With regard to our
                            proposal for an exchange of data gained from 1964 Mars missions,
                                <persName corresp="#p_BAA3">Blagonravov</persName> replied that the
                            Soviets would be willing to exchange data if they should fly Mars
                            missions and these should be successful.</p>
                        <p>On several occasions during the course of the discussions, the Soviets
                            expressed an interest in exchanging information on closed ecological
                            systems. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_DHL1">Dryden</persName> informed them
                            that we stood ready to consider any specific proposals that the Soviets
                            wished to make.</p>
                        <p>Our experience since June suggests that the Soviets are willing to
                            cooperate in a generalized and limited way, but that they remain
                            relatively inflexible with respect to commitments in negotiation and are
                            laggard in execution. Their performance does not seriously reflect the
                            assurances recently offered by Academician <persName corresp="#p_KMV2"

                                of disarmament matters in a private session at the UN General
                                Assembly. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> told
                                Gromyko that the United States was prepared to go “as far as
                                possible” in the field of space cooperation, but noted that “we were
                                sufficiently realistic to understand that where military aspects
                                were involved, cooperation might be limited.” Gromyko replied that
                                the Soviets favored cooperation “in principle” but would find it
                                easier to respond if the United States fielded specific proposals.

                            opportunities for cooperation with the Soviet Union. For the immediate
                            future, it might be useful to convey to top Soviet leadership, as
                            opportunity affords, our dissatisfaction with the painfully slow and
                            limited progress to date, as well as with Soviet reluctance to enter
                            into reasonable arrangements for implementing agreements. It may be that
                            Soviet leadership does not know of these limitations in performance. (In

                        <p>On March 19, 1965, Vice President <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1"
                                >Humphrey</persName> gave his first major speech on space policy at
                            a dinner honoring Robert Goddard, father of the modern space program.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> set out his vision
                            for America's space program and placed it in the context of the
                            administration's goals. “Let me assure you that the Great Society
                            envisioned by President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon
                                Johnson</persName> is not one limited to the fight against poverty,
                            ignorance, disease, and intolerance,” he said. “The Great Society
                            requires, in addition, an urgent quest for excellence, for intellectual
                            attainment, for crossing new frontiers in science and technology. Let me
                            emphasize that an adequately funded, well-directed space program is an
                            integral part of our nation's commitment to its future, to its
                            greatness.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> argued that the
                            nation's “strong and prosperous” economy would permit the government to
                            simultaneously address domestic problems while exploring space: “We can
                            put a man on the moon at the same time as we help to put a man on his
                            feet.” He also reminded the audience that the Soviet Union was enjoying
                            great success in its space program. “Our national security alone would
                            suggest reason enough for us to strive for absolute leadership in space
                            exploration,” he said. “Every time we pause, we have had a shock from
                            the Soviet <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0099"/>efforts in space,”
                                <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> explained, citing
                            the first successful space walk completed by a cosmonaut the previous
                            day. The text of the Vice President's speech is in the Minnesota

                        <p>On April 13, in his first appearance as Chairman of the Space Council,
                                <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> expanded on these
                            themes: “I see benefits flowing from the space program in the
                            furtherance of international cooperation and in laying the groundwork
                            for the creation of world peace. It is my belief that the total of these
                            benefits will greatly exceed our total investment in the entire program.
                            Our activities in space and in aeronautics are important parts of
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s Great
                            Society.” “I am convinced,” he emphasized, “that international
                            cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space is a cornerstone of
                            United States policy.” The text of Humphrey's speech is ibid., Outer

                                    target="#t_NASA1">NASA</gloss> Chief James Webb: “The Vice
                                President had indicated that we should make the maximum propaganda
                                use of our space activities. He felt that many things could be done
                                which were not being done to involve the interest of peoples around
                                the world. He cited Latin America as one area particularly where
                                more could be done. <persName corresp="#p_WJE1">Webb</persName>
                                objected rather strenuously to some aspects of what the Vice
                                President had to say. It was my judgment that <persName

                                of what was offered but to other factors. He indicated that no
                                President had ever told him to use the space program in a propaganda

                        <p>The latest world-wide opinion survey conducted by USIA early in 1964 in
                            nineteen countries and major cities indicated that, by large margins,
                            the public abroad believes that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> is ahead of the U.S. in space activities and, perhaps
                            by association, in nuclear strength and general scientific development.
                            Only in Ankara was there a majority favoring U.S. superiority. Opinions
                            were close in West Germany, Austria, Manila and Bangkok.</p>
                        <p>In the U.K. measurements of public opinion have been taken frequently
                            over a considerable period of time so as to reflect the variations
                            caused by specific space events. A nationwide public opinion survey
                            taken in the U.K. following the Ranger VII moon shot in July, 1964
                            showed an improvement in the relative U.S. position. Later, however, on
                            the heels of the Soviet orbiting of the three-man VOSKHOD–1 in October,
                            1964 British public opinion favored a Soviet lead in space by nearly
                            four to one. The most recent survey, conducted immediately following the
                            Soviet VOSKHOD–2 flight and the U.S. Gemini manned flight in March of
                            this year, suggests that this sequence of space events benefited the
                                Soviets.<note n="3" xml:id="d32fn3">In a March 19 memorandum for

                        <p>In the short term (between now and 1970) we must anticipate that the
                            Soviets will succeed in confronting us with additional space “coups” and
                            that the fiftieth anniversary of the October Revolution (1967) will
                            likely see special efforts in this regard. During this period we should
                            attempt to anticipate these Soviet events with a view to softening their
                            impact—particularly any public misreading or exaggeration of military
                            implications—and maximizing the impact of our own successes.</p>
                        <p>An improvement in the image abroad of our space program relative to that
                            of the Soviets requires first and foremost successful completion of the
                            space flight programs to which the U.S. is already committed publicly.
                            From the reactions abroad thus far it is quite clear that there can be

                        <p>8. What space programs should be emphasized in our current planning so
                            that the United States does attain and maintain a world leadership
                            position in the future?</p>
                        <p>Our paramount concern is for the successful completion of the programs to
                            which we are publicly committed. In addition, from the viewpoint of U.S.
                            foreign policy objectives in the long run, it appears essential that we
                            maintain an effort in advanced research and development sufficient to
                            enable us to take advantage of important opportunities in the future
                            which will be beyond the present state of the art and may affect our
                            national security and international posture. This would appear to be
                            particularly true in the case of those advanced technologies required
                            for space propulsion and interplanetary missions in the period following
                            the initial manned exploration of the moon and unmanned exploration of
                            the nearby planets. It is also important that we take advantage of all
                            significant opportunities to extend the development and use of practical
                            applications of space technology which can engage the effective
                            participation of other countries and from which other <pb n="72"

                            satellites.</p>
                        <p>Bearing in mind the requirements of our national security and our
                            international posture, it is in these latter areas (advanced
                            capabilities and maximum early development of practical applications)
                            that we urge the members of the Space Council to give particular
                            consideration to the long-range aspects of the space program.</p>

                                others; they are correctly not regarded as evidence of U.S.
                                willingness to develop technology jointly with others. Also, they
                                tend to foster nationalistic competition among the European
                                countries cooperating with us, which is contrary to general U.S.

                            <item>But there must also be projects of earlier maturity and even
                                greater popular and industrial appeal which might merit
                                consideration. Particularly attractive is manned lunar exploration.
                                Putting the first men on the moon is a U.S. project with such
                                momentum that it clearly does not offer real prospects for
                                internationalization. But surely lunar exploration thereafter will
                                be a long-term and broad program to which other countries could
                                contribute—and participating in U.S. program on cooperative basis is
                                one chance other countries can have for sharing this experience.
                                Surely it is politically right to offer our friends a chance,
                                through cooperation with us, to reach the moon—and not reserve that
                                achievement of a dream as old as mankind for Americans and Russians
                                alone.</item>

                                        go on to logical next steps such as arms control, working
                                        toward détente by working at political solutions of

                                <p>“Only last summer, our two governments worked out an agreement

                                <p>Now, we would like to discuss with you—and with others—an even

                                    do so well alone. Examples would be two projects which stand
                                    high on the space agenda. Both are very demanding and both are
                                    quite complex. One would be a probe to the sun, and another a
                                    probe to Jupiter. To cooperate on such a major endeavor would
                                    contribute vastly to our mutual knowledge and to our mutual

                        <p>The President's proposal and the team's mission are to be represented as
                            an American response to the frequently-stated European desire for
                            greater participation in the development of space technology. The
                            President is desirous of accommodating this desire and has therefore
                            suggested certain opportunities which may be taken up by the European
                            nations if they are, in fact, sufficiently interested.</p>
                        <p>These opportunities can and should be formulated in terms consistent with
                            U.S. foreign policy objectives and <gloss target="#t_NASA1"
                            >NASA</gloss>'s cooperative program. This means that the United States
                            is willing to cooperate in identifiable, essentially non-duplicating,
                            advanced projects of mutual interest in the mainstream of space
                            exploration. The significant difference is that the examples cited by
                            the President in his suggestion to Chancellor Erhard make clear his
                            readiness to consider cooperative projects of considerably greater
                            magnitude and more far-reaching technological implications than anything
                            proposed heretofore.</p>
                        <p>The President's specific suggestions of Jupiter or solar probes are to be
                            understood only as examples indicating (a) the extent to which the
                            United States is prepared to go in cooperation with European nations,
                            and (b) types of projects which can afford a wide exercise in space
                            technology. The precise levels of cost and difficulty which Europe may
                            be prepared to face are entirely for Europe to decide. It is possible to
                            modify the division of responsibilities in such advanced projects so
                            that certain spacecraft elements would be contributed by the U.S. to
                            lighten the load on Europe. It is also possible to define useful
                            projects of lesser cost and difficulty which yet can contribute toward
                            the advanced projects suggested by the President. <gloss
                                target="#t_NASA1">NASA</gloss> is prepared to discuss projects at
                            either the advanced or intermediate levels and to hear from interested
                            European authorities ideas of their own which are subject to formulation
                            within the existing guidelines.</p>
                        <p>While Europe must determine its own interest in these prospects, and the
                            United States does not mean to pursue the matter in the absence of such
                            interest, we are nevertheless prepared to explain our own concept of the
                            values, in the near and distant term, which we attach to our own heavy
                            investment in space technology. We are prepared to do this in the
                            thought that our own experience and our own expectations may be of some
                            use to European authorities in determining where their best interests
                            lie. (These values are to be stated in terms of the contribution major
                            advanced technological exercises can make to the <pb n="83"
                                xml:id="pg_83" facs="0113"/>partnership of government, university,
                            and industry, to the development of critical management capabilities, to
                            economic security, and to common political objectives of
                            institution-building and western cohesion.)</p>
                        <p>Discussion of the foregoing benefits should establish a basis for
                            pointing out the possible growth implications of a successful
                            collaboration of the kind envisaged by the President. Collaboration in
                            space technology in associating its technical capability with other
                            technology in the future could lead to the development of other broader,
                            political economic and technical interests.</p>
                        <p>Reverting to the specific project formulations which are possible, the
                            President's suggestion is premised on the following conceptual
                            framework. It is possible to define spacecraft whose development would
                            afford a very wide exercise in space technology and whose use would fit
                            into on-going space exploration programs. The European community might
                            undertake responsibility for the preparation of such spacecraft while
                            the U.S. would undertake their launching and, to the extent required,
                            tracking and data acquisition. Tracking and data acquisition by <gloss
                                target="#t_ESRO1">ESRO</gloss> or its members to the extent they can
                            meet the requirement is not precluded. European recourse to American
                            experience and competence would be available essentially through two
                            channels: (a) a joint working group at the project level, and (b)
                            commercial ties which may arise between European and American firms,
                            with export arrangements facilitated by the United States. Effective
                            precedents and patterns for the functioning of both channels are well
                            established.</p>
                        <p>The conceptual framework should serve (a) to accommodate most alternative
                            project proposals which may be suggested either by <gloss
                                target="#t_NASA1">NASA</gloss> or the Europeans, and (b) to direct
                            discussion toward spacecraft responsibilities for Europe rather than
                            delivery vehicle-related responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. preference is that any cooperative undertaking should be
                            multilateral in character while allowing scope for West German
                            leadership. (Expanded bilateral cooperation with European countries can
                            go forward as appropriate.) Indeed, German initiative may be useful in
                            motivating the participation of other countries.<note n="4"

                            the Space Council had a very lively discussion of whether the U.S. was

                                problems of stimulating foreign involvement in space technology as a

                                weapons themselves, we might even hope to free vehicle technology
                                for maximum stimulus of space activity abroad.” (Letter from

                            implication of the various remarks made at the meeting seemed to be that
                            the U.S. had been playing a fairly passive role in space cooperation and
                            ought to do much more. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH7">Pollack</persName>
                            is seeing Ed Welsh of the Space Council staff this afternoon about
                            setting up an interdepartmental working group which will conduct a
                            fundamental review of international space cooperation. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PH7">Pollack</persName> will suggest that the question
                            of export of space technology be handled by one group while all other
                            aspects of space cooperation be handled by a second group. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PH7">Pollack</persName> apparently thinks that G/<gloss
                                target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> might handle the export of space
                            technology while <gloss target="#t_SCI1">SCI</gloss> would take the
                            leadership on all other aspects.</p>
                        <p>The State Department had evidently gone to this session of the Space
                            Council prepared to take the initiative in suggesting a basic review of
                            space cooperation but was pre-empted to some extent by Vice President
                                <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName>. The Vice President
                            expressed concern that European industry gets the benefits of
                            technological spin-offs from the U.S. space program at a bargain
                            basement price, not having to pick up <pb n="86" xml:id="pg_86"
                                facs="0116"/>the tab for basic research which is done in the United
                            States. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJE1">Webb</persName> pointed out that
                            technology is sold to Europeans by U.S. industry on the basis of cash on
                            the barrel head. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                >McNamara</persName> charged into this subject in a major way with
                            sharp criticism of present restraints on the export of technological
                            information. He maintained that we should restrict export of information
                            only to a narrow range of subjects having to do with capabilities to
                            acquire a nuclear delivery capability.<note n="4" xml:id="d40fn4">In an

                                Defense cautioned, “Although <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> is
                                alert and receptive to new opportunities in the military space
                                programs, our cooperative efforts must necessarily be highly
                                selective.” He detailed joint ventures with the United Kingdom and
                                Canada and said that Australia soon might also be a partner, but
                                stated: “We should pay particular attention to the need for avoiding
                                the export to the French of booster technology….France's role in the

                                    >McNamara</persName> wrote to <persName corresp="#p_WJE1"
                                    >Webb</persName> on May 14: “As you know, I strongly support
                                international cooperative ventures in space. I have directed my
                                staff to be as liberal as possible regarding the release of space
                                technology for payloads and other support items.” (Ibid.)</note>
                            Moreover, the Government should not let business determine the nature of
                            cooperation with European industry. Government cooperation would be
                            preferable in some instances and, in particular, there should be a pro
                            rata charge of the <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss> element of
                            technological information, a cost often borne by the U.S. Government.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> also
                            suggested that rather than ask each country what its interest was in the
                            space field we should look at each country's technological capacity and
                            then push them to use this capacity to the limit in the space field. In
                            response to a question from the Vice President as to whether this was
                            “positive disarmament” Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                >McNamara</persName> replied that it was since at the present time
                            many countries felt they should make technological progress through
                            military hardware programs. A divergence to a space program would be
                            wholesome for all concerned.</p>
                        <p>It was also mentioned by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH7"
                                >Pollack</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_MLH1">Leonard

                            space technology. This proposal will obviously have a close relationship
                            to the working groups which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH7"
                                >Pollack</persName> anticipates will be established.</p>

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WEC1">Welsh</persName> opened the meeting by
                            stating that he had dispatched a letter to each member of the Space

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH7">Pollack</persName> then stated that he had
                            delved into the export of technology question and determined that it has
                            a long history; that considerable work had been accomplished by an
                            interagency working group under NSAMs 294 and 338;<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d41fn3">NSAM No. 294, “US Nuclear and Strategic Delivery
                                Systems to France,” and NSAM No. 338, “Policy Concerning U.S.

                                Capabilities.” (Department of State, NSAM Files: Lot 72 D
                                316)</note> that ACDA had done considerable thinking in this area
                            and were now pushing the position for “positive disarmament.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH7">Pollack</persName> queried into the
                            background of why the Vice President raised the export of technology
                            question at the Space Council. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WEC1"
                                >Welsh</persName> pointed out that in meetings with the Space
                            Council staff the export of technology had been discussed and that this
                            probably grew out of earlier interagency working group meetings in which
                            the export of technology had been added as a possible item for
                            discussion by the Space Council. He also pointed out at the Space
                            Council meeting on March 3, 1966 the Vice President had announced that
                            the next Space Council meeting would be on the subject of International
                            Cooperation. This subject was the Vice President's idea and it resulted
                            from his travels and thinking. However, the Vice President wanted to
                            talk about specific items and the advanced working group meeting had
                            been held for the purpose of delineating the specific items which would
                            be worthy of discussion by the Space Council. The Vice President stated
                            he would like to see a greater participation by Europe in space
                            activities particularly <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0118"/>in
                            cooperation with the US and that the great scientific potential of
                            Europe, Germany for instance, tapped to help solve the space problems.
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WEC1">Welsh</persName> emphasized that the
                            export of technology is only one of many items which had entered into
                            the overall international cooperation picture. He acknowledged it was
                            the most talked about item at the Space Council meeting but implied that
                            this was only because the participants who did the most talking were
                            particularly interested in this aspect of international cooperation. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WEC1">Welsh</persName> pointed out that
                            considerable importance was attached to international cooperation in
                            space as evidenced by the fact that international cooperation was the
                            only subject on which the Space Council had had two meetings. This
                            emphasis was due to the fact that it was considered by the Space Council
                            staff to be a subject of great importance. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WEC1">Welsh</persName> pointed out that in the letter he
                            sent to the Space Council principals the Vice President had requested
                            each member of the Space Council to prepare a paper on ways
                            international cooperation in space could be improved and to pass these
                            to <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">U. Alexis Johnson</persName>. The
                            principal purpose of this exercise was to bring in ideas. It was not the
                            desire of the Vice President at this time to tell the agencies how to
                            improve international cooperation in space but to seek ideas from the
                            agencies. Some of the example suggestions were: positive disarmament,
                            selling abroad, and improved public relations of our space program.</p>
                        <p>At a future Space Council meeting Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> should
                            probably present a consolidation of these ideas pointing out existing
                            authority or additional authority that was needed to accomplish the
                            program, existing funds available or funds that would be required to
                            carry out the program.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WEC1">Welsh</persName> further pointed out that
                            the “<persName corresp="#p_MLH1">Marks</persName>” Study is not a
                            separate entity but a part of the overall program.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH7">Pollack</persName> then raised the
                            question about communication satellites and how this fits into the
                            overall picture. He pointed out this was a very large subject in itself
                            and would require extensive study from the point of view of educational
                            satellites, TV satellites, distribution satellites and direct
                            broadcasting satellites and ground stations. It was pointed out that
                            considerable study is already underway by various agencies of the
                            Government as well as by the <gloss target="#t_COMSAT1">ComSat</gloss>
                            Corporation in these areas.<note n="4" xml:id="d41fn4">

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WEC1">Welsh</persName> concluded by stating

                            President's Special Assistant for Science and Technology, asked Vice
                            President <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> if he could
                            attend Space Council meetings, a request his predecessor, <persName

                                <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName> wrote in his March 29
                            letter to <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName>: “I was sorry
                            not to have been invited to the most recent meeting, since it concerned
                            questions in which I have been deeply interested for the President.” He
                            noted that he particularly wanted to discuss international and trade
                            policies with the Vice President, so that his “efforts and thinking
                            could be closely tied into it.” (Minnesota Historical Society, Papers of

                            membership in the Council had been limited by Congress. (Draft

                                <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> rejected the draft,
                            and the final response, dated April 6, read: “As you know, membership of
                            the Council is prescribed by statute. I do believe, however, that we can
                            and should have considerable flexibility in inviting responsible
                            officials on the basis of subject matter to be covered and the specific
                            interest of the members in the views of those invited.” (Ibid.)</p>

                            multilateral framework for launcher development. In such framework
                            rocket programs tend to be more open, serve peaceful uses, are subject
                            to international control and absorb manpower and financial resources
                            that might otherwise be diverted to purely national programs. National
                            rocket programs on other hand tend to concentrate on militarily
                            significant solid or storable liquid fuel systems, are less open, and
                            less responsive to international controls. Any breakup of <gloss

                                that the “French military would be happy with <gloss

                            indicated above, such cooperation might assist in non-proliferation
                            effort by channeling resources down non-storable liquid-fueled road
                            rather than solid fuel or storable liquid roads, which are much more

                            British investment in <gloss target="#t_ELDO1">ELDO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The British Foreign Office has staunchly supported continued
                            participation in <gloss target="#t_ELDO1">ELDO</gloss> because of its
                            implications to British relationships with the Continent and the Common
                            Market, and because of adverse impact on European multilateral
                            developments that would follow a breakup of <gloss target="#t_ELDO1"
                                >ELDO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Comparable considerations ran through the minds of various officials of
                            the Department and <gloss target="#t_NASA1">NASA</gloss>. Additionally,
                            we preferred multilateral to national programs of launcher development,
                            we were concerned about possible Soviet moves to fill the vacuum that
                            would be created by <gloss target="#t_ELDO1">ELDO</gloss>'s dissolution,
                            and we related Europe's technological development to its participation
                            in major space activities. Our general concerns about the consequences
                            of <gloss target="#t_ELDO1">ELDO</gloss>'s dissolution were conveyed to
                            the British prior to the <gloss target="#t_ELDO1">ELDO</gloss> meeting
                            on April 28. Partially as a consequence the British Cabinet decided
                            against immediate withdrawal and the <gloss target="#t_ELDO1"
                                >ELDO</gloss> meeting resulted in a six-week “reprieve”. The crucial

                            June 9. The British Cabinet will be meeting on May 26, according to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FRS1">Faber</persName>, to settle the British

                        <p>Department and other interested agencies had been concerned about this

                            development programs in contrast to national programs, connection
                            between space technology and European efforts to meet technological gap
                            and potential for advantage to Soviets in collapse of <gloss

                            conveyed to British Embassy here and to Sir <persName corresp="#p_ZSS1"

                        <p>On May 16 British Embassy suggested it would be useful if highest levels
                            Department could mention to George Thomson U.S. hopes that U.K. would

                            Johnson and Under Secretary did so. Interested U.S. agencies have been
                            in process of developing U.S. position providing for U.S. cooperation

                            components in the definition of our international stature. The United

                            must recognize that international advantage flows more readily and
                            constantly from sound and solid scientific endeavors than from

                            should be calculated to fulfill the scientific and technological
                            potential of outer space, but on a scale and in a manner that will
                            exploit all reasonable opportunities which may enhance our world
                            position in the future.</p>
                        <p>Soviet skill in exploiting space achievements to their advantage in the
                            areas of national prestige and international politics must be recognized
                            and countered. We must expect that space spectaculars will continue to
                            be the order of the day to the extreme limit of Soviet capability. And
                            they will not stop at the moon.</p>
                        <p>During the first ten years of the Space Age we have regularly found
                            ourselves in the apparent position of following the Soviet lead in space
                            exploration, of responding to, rather than issuing, challenges. We have,
                            and should continue to have, a superior program characterized by
                            openness and a willingness to share knowledge freely. We should guard
                            against a gap in planning and development that will vitiate our
                            advantages and leave us in a posture of response rather than of
                            leadership.</p>
                        <p>In view of all these points it does not seem too early to seek answers to
                            several questions regarding what comes next.</p>

                        <p>In the spring of 1966 the British Government began the process of
                            reconsideration of its participation in <gloss target="#t_ELDO1"
                                >ELDO</gloss>. When it became apparent that this reconsideration
                            might lead to British withdrawal from <gloss target="#t_ELDO1"
                                >ELDO</gloss>, the United States made known to the British and to
                            certain other members of <gloss target="#t_ELDO1">ELDO</gloss> its hope
                            that the British would continue their <gloss target="#t_ELDO1"
                                >ELDO</gloss> membership and participation. The United States
                            informed the British that a “U.S. position would be prepared providing
                            for cooperation with <gloss target="#t_ELDO1">ELDO</gloss> in the event
                                <gloss target="#t_ELDO1">ELDO</gloss> members desire such
                            cooperation.” At a meeting of <gloss target="#t_ELDO1">ELDO</gloss> on
                            June 9, Great Britain sought a reduction in the British <gloss

                                <gloss target="#t_ELDO1">ELDO</gloss> was no doubt influenced by the
                            severe European reaction to the possibility of British withdrawal and to

                            while at the same time safeguarding US concerns about the proliferation

                        <p>We feel that this is a matter of urgency in view of the recent debate

                            President's December 1965 proposal for international space cooperation
                            (see <ref target="#d36">Documents 36</ref> and <ref target="#d37"
                                >37</ref>). U.S. ideas for an “Advanced Cooperative Space Project”
                            (ACSP) included proposals for a joint U.S.-European probe to either the
                            Sun or Jupiter. The European countries limited their consideration to
                            these specific projects although they were only examples of possible
                            missions. <gloss target="#t_NASA1">NASA</gloss> believed that European
                            officials were favorable to a joint program, but the fact that the
                            proposal came from the United States was a serious defect in European
                            eyes. <gloss target="#t_NASA1">NASA</gloss> officials had few options on
                            how to proceed and hoped that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WC1"
                                >Wilson</persName>, during an upcoming visit to Washington, would
                            signal his readiness for the United Kingdom to provide leadership within
                            Europe. <gloss target="#t_NASA1">NASA</gloss> suggested that, in his
                            meetings with Wilson, the President note “casually that he continues to
                            have some interest in the possibility that advanced space projects could
                            stimulate Europe to more rapid progress in technology through joint
                            efforts in cooperation with the United States.” (National Aeronautics

                            reviewed the proposals and reported in August 1966 that some proposals
                            were “very favorably received” and others were discussed. But, the
                            chairman added, “The Council had to recognise that an additional project

                            “sufficiently distant,” it was time to reconsider the proposal for a

                            as a personal fact-finding mission. He was to stress U.S. interest in
                            cooperation and assure the Europeans that “the President's proposal was
                            in no sense intended to channel <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0136"

                            the general atmosphere had been slightly improved by the State

                            “All in all, we must say the President's proposal got off to a poor

                            that the proposal will not be given a hard negative in Europe, that we
                            will be successful in keeping it alive and on the books, and that slowly
                            we will induce the Europeans to recognize the advantages in directing

                            wrote: “The European countries, with the exception of Germany, are

                            remain our long-term goal.” (Ibid.; <persName corresp="#p_WJE1"

                            booster developments, and to avoid any appearance of boycotting Paris.”
                            He reported to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> in
                            October that the British were interested but “severely limited” by
                            fiscal constraints. The Germans were interested in bilateral projects,
                            but were not prepared to discuss launching a German experimental
                            communications satellite by the United States. “Taken together with
                            information obtained in London, this suggests the possibility of an
                            increasing regional European interest in communications satellites,

                            preference was for a communications satellite launch within the

                            that a regional system might be obsolete before it could be put into

                            actions taken within our government toward a more consistent approach to
                            the needs of those nations we are anxious to have increase their own
                            competence so that they can better participate in multilateral

                        <p rend="center">Summary</p>
                        <p>Even before the outcome of the moon race has been decided, we face the
                            question of whether to commit ourselves to still more ambitious <pb
                                n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0139"/>programs—proceeding with manned
                            exploration of the moon after the initial landing; mounting large-scale
                            scientific investigations with unmanned planetary and solar probes;
                            projecting man through space to the planets.</p>
                        <p>These are challenging goals. There are probably good reasons for pursuing
                            them in due course, and achieving them might enhance our international
                            position. For example, efforts directed toward manned lunar exploration
                            and toward conducting scientific observations from the moon's surface
                            would be useful for advancing scientific knowledge and could demonstrate
                            that the moon race was not an end in itself.</p>
                        <p>However, from the standpoint of our foreign policy interests, we see no
                            compelling reasons for early, major commitments to such goals, or for
                            pursuing them at the pace that has characterized the race to the moon.
                            Moreover, if we can de-emphasize or stretch out additional costly
                            programs aimed at the moon and beyond, resources may to some extent be
                            released for other objectives—foreign aid, domestic needs, scientific
                            efforts in other areas—which might serve more immediate, higher priority
                            U.S. interests.</p>

                        <p>Instead of indefinitely extending the space race, it would be preferable
                            to work toward a twofold objective:</p>

                            national efforts with a view to limiting pressures for racing toward new
                            goalposts deep in space. We probably can't expect the Soviets to be
                            seriously interested in tapering off before (and unless) the moon race
                            itself convinces them that cooperation—or the more deliberate pacing of
                            space exploration achievable through coordination—is more advantageous
                            than wasteful national competition. For our own part, we can proceed now
                            to examine ways and means of working with them when and if they are
                            ready, and we can seek to engage them in additional cooperative efforts
                            in near space.</p>

                            should work harder to bridge the gap in awareness and understanding of

                            increasing openness of the earth to the view from space. Although our
                            own grasp of the potentialities of these changes is still limited, that
                            of technically unsophisticated countries is far less. Greater awareness

                            on earth, we will need a vigorous and imaginative space effort. In order
                            to support the foregoing twofold objective while ensuring flexibility to
                            meet unforeseeable needs, we might most usefully emphasize programs

                                    psychological surprises affecting our security. On the other
                                    hand, we should be ready to use space technology for arms
                                    control and peacekeeping if and as political conditions
                                    permit.</item>

                                    example, a Manned Orbital Research Laboratory could serve
                                    scientific purposes and provide a vehicle for cooperation in

                                    necessary for advanced manned and unmanned spaceflight. This
                                    should enhance our flexibility and help keep our knowledge and

                        <p>This kind of program emphasis would not be cheap, but it would be less
                            costly than an indefinite expansion of the scope and pace of the space
                            race. If we pursue this kind of program vigorously and imaginatively, we
                            will have a firm footing for our foreign policy interests as they are
                            affected by space.</p>
                        <p>The decisions now confronting us will, of course, be influenced by a
                            broader range of considerations, and foreign policy needs must be
                            properly related to other national interests. For present purposes, the
                            main question is whether the thrust of the approach outlined above is in

                            give immediate attention to developments beyond the Apollo phase. I am
                            sure you recognize that your study will provoke a good deal of comment

                            the existence of the paper has become known outside the Vice President's
                            office (e.g.: to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJE1">Webb</persName> and Dr.

                            concerned with this matter and would be involved in its consideration by
                            the Space Council—particularly since the paper is thought to be relevant

                        <p>In view of the Vice President's response, and as a means of responding to
                            the interest of these officials, we suggest that the paper be made

                            paper is a staff “think piece” and is circulated for information and
                            comment rather than as a formal proposal. We would be prepared to see to

                        <p>On February 12, 1967, the President's Science Advisory Committee (<gloss
                                target="#t_PSAC1">PSAC</gloss>) released a report entitled, “The
                            Space Program in the Post-Apollo Period.” Prepared by the Space Science
                            and Space Technology panels of the <gloss target="#t_PSAC1"
                            >PSAC</gloss>, the report rejected the adoption of a “single dominating
                            goal” like the moon race, in favor of a balanced program based upon the
                            expectation of eventual manned planetary exploration. (Johnson Library,
                            National Security File, <persName corresp="#p_JCE1">Charles E.

                            16)</p>
                        <p>In a February 27 memorandum to the Secretary, <persName corresp="#p_PH7"
                                >Pollack</persName> summarized the conclusions and implications of
                            the report. He wrote: “The Report is directed solely to the space
                            program. It does not attempt to weight the relative importance of
                            science in space as compared with other major scientific tasks.” The
                                <gloss target="#t_PSAC1">PSAC</gloss> authors admitted their belief
                            that the expenditures for a continuing national effort in space science
                            and exploration were so great that “the justification must be found in
                            indirect benefits to the Society which we cannot evaluate in scientific
                            terms.” Accordingly, the report dealt little with military, political,
                            and economic factors. While addressing the questions of U.S. leadership
                            and international cooperation, the report was heavily weighted toward
                            the scientific objectives and benefits of the space program.</p>

                            diverged from positions taken previously by the Secretary. (<ref

                            significant space science to be done during the 1970s would be
                            accomplished in earth orbit, “<gloss target="#t_PSAC1">PSAC</gloss>

                            fixing “1971 or 1972 as the Lunar Exploration Year (i.e., as the year in
                            which moon landings are to take place), with a view to defusing the moon

                            noted that agreement on these suggestions was unlikely: “Little

                            astronauts from both countries, or particularly of a joint venture to go
                            to the moon. The former difficulty arises from a lack of training and
                            acquaintance with the equipment and also a dead-end argument as to whose
                            equipment would be used for what. The latter is impractical because both
                            countries have proceeded so far along the path of facilities and

                        <p>Later in May, the Department submitted a redraft of its October 1966
                            paper (<ref target="#d55">Document 55</ref>). The revised paper,
                            entitled “Space Goals and Foreign Policy Priorities,” was similar to the
                            earlier version, and re-emphasized its most important points, especially
                            in light of the conclusion of the <gloss target="#t_PSAC1">PSAC</gloss>
                            report on interplanetary travel (<ref target="#d58">see Document
                                58</ref>). The paper noted: “as best as we can now understand its
                            implications, an interplanetary program—particularly a manned planetary
                            program—will have the least direct relevance to our international
                            needs.”</p>
                        <p>The paper pointed out that overseas interest in a U.S.-Soviet space race
                            was diminishing and that a post-Apollo program should not be designed in
                            that context since “it appears that space will be increasingly
                            internationalized.” It concluded that space objectives were important,
                            but that they must be competitive with other national goals and that the
                            United States must embrace a broad-based approach to science because
                            “the ‘Sputnik 1' of the future could well occur not in space, but in
                            some other field of science or technology” which has an “equal or
                            greater” claim on U.S. resources. (Letter from <persName

                        <p>In June the Interagency Working Group on Expanded International
                            Cooperation in Outer Space Activities submitted its final report to the
                            Vice President. The report sounded a note of caution on international
                            cooperation in space, citing numerous problems of classification and
                            control. <gloss target="#t_NASA1">NASA</gloss>'s leaders did not believe
                            that the possibilities for cooperation should be the prime criteria for
                            determining national space goals. “We must be careful lest, in designing
                            our space programs for the future, we submerge these opportunities in
                            commitments to other objectives or projects which do not lend themselves
                            as readily to international cooperation.” (National Archives and Records

                        <p>“We regret that the Soviets have not been prepared to move more rapidly
                            and more broadly to cooperate in space. We would welcome meaningful
                            cooperation in projects of mutual interest and have set no arbitrary
                            limits of any kind. We do not propose to stop trying, but it seems
                            apparent that significant cooperation depends upon the Soviet Union
                            effecting very substantial changes in its attitudes.”</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName>Sedov</persName>'s Statements</hi>.
                            Sedov made several statements in a press conference at the International
                            Astronautical Federation meetings in Belgrade recently which were
                            interpreted here in the United States as indicating that the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> favored space cooperation with the
                            United States. It is <gloss target="#t_NASA1">NASA</gloss>'s view that
                            Sedov's statements were misinterpreted. First of all, the meeting was
                            not a governmental meeting and none of Sedov's comments committed his
                            Government either as to policy or <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118"
                                facs="0148"/>as to plan. In <gloss target="#t_NASA1">NASA</gloss>'s
                            view, there is no basis for encouragement from the reports on Sedov's
                            remarks. The State Department also has analyzed these statements and
                            seems to feel that prospects regarding <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> cooperation are remote and that such cooperation would
                            have to be based on a new international climate. Disagreement with the
                            war in Vietnam seems to be a major stumbling block.</p>
                        <p>It is recalled that Sedov has made statements vaguely suggestive of
                            cooperation practically every year at the International Astronautical
                            Federation meetings. I attach no significant weight to the reports on
                            Sedov's remarks and believe that they were carried primarily by the New
                            York Times because they fitted so well with that newspaper's editorial
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Recommendations</hi>. In spite of this gloomy
                            picture regarding Soviet cooperation, it seems reasonable that we should
                            continue to try not only because it might assist in the space program,
                            but also because it might have broader international impact.
                            Consequently, the following is suggested: <list>

                                    recently concluded Space Treaty. This could deal with assistance
                                    to astronauts in distress, coordinated tracking and data
                                    acquisition, etc.</item>

                                    cooperation could be realistic.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>Since Article X in the Space Treaty provides for equality of
                                    opportunity to observe the flight of space objects, it would be
                                    well to attempt mutuality of observations. This would call for
                                    the development of common frequencies for tracking and data
                                    readouts, etc.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The above-listed are just some of the possible approaches which might be
                            made. This is not to indicate that <gloss target="#t_NASA1">NASA</gloss>
                            has failed to explore these various avenues, but rather is simply a
                            recommendation that we not be discouraged with the small amount of
                            progress made in past attempts.</p>

                        <p rend="center">II. Background</p>
                        <p>This is the first major meeting with the European Conference on Satellite
                            Communications in which the United States will be an official
                            participant. It marks an important stage in the development of
                            international arrangements for satellite communication. However, the
                            meeting is not a negotiation and the delegation is not authorized to
                            negotiate or enter into any agreements. The principal purpose of the
                            meeting is to permit the parties to explore views and objectives, both
                            on the subject of definitive arrangements for satellite communication
                            and on the question of interim arrangements. These explorations look
                            towards continuing discussion with European countries culminating,
                            hopefully, in the negotiation and conclusion of organizational
                            agreements.</p>
                        <p>The United States is the only country that has developed and launched
                            communication satellites. The Soviet Union is presumed to have the
                            technology, and could probably launch communication satellites in a
                            short period of time. It will be several years at best before any
                            European countries, acting either individually or in combination, can
                            launch communication satellites with their own boosters, and many <pb
                                n="122" xml:id="pg_122" facs="0152"/>years before they would be in a
                            position to launch a system competitive with that of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The United States is in a position to move forward rapidly with the
                            development of a communication satellite system. This development will
                            fall roughly into three stages. First, the Communication Satellite
                            Corporation plans to establish a limited “experimental/operational”
                            capability over the North Atlantic in 1965. Work will go forward also on
                            various medium altitude systems. Second, there will be a basic global
                            system. Under present plans, the choice of basic system will be made in
                            September, 1965. If the Corporation opts for synchronous satellites the
                            “experimental/operational” systems will be extended to provide it. If
                            not, it will be a medium altitude system. In any event the United States
                            anticipates that the basic system, which will have a global capability,
                            will come into being in 1966–67. And finally, there will be a fully
                            developed global system of communication satellites. This will have to
                            evolve over a period of years. Although technical developments may thus
                            be divided into three roughly defined stages, it is convenient to think
                            of organizational arrangements in terms of two stages: first,
                            arrangements for an interim period, and second, a definitive
                            organizational structure designed to accommodate a broader range of
                            international interests. Both stages are on the agenda for discussion at
                            the Rome meeting.</p>
                        <p>The primary goal of the United States at the Rome meeting will be to
                            explore ways of obtaining participation by other nations in each of
                            these stages on a basis that is compatible with United States satellite
                            communications objectives, and particularly in such a way as not to
                            delay the schedule on which the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> is
                            now operating.</p>
                        <p>As to <hi rend="italic">definitive arrangements</hi>, the United States
                            will necessarily have to discuss these in rather generalized terms
                            because our thinking is still not very far advanced. It will be
                            important, however, to explore in as much detail as possible the ideas
                            of individual European countries and the Conference so that, as we
                            develop our own proposals over the coming months, the United States will
                            be able to make maximum use of its bargaining power, which may well be
                            at its peak during the early years of the system when we have a monopoly
                            of the boosters and of communication technology. The European countries
                            know that the United States will dominate the system for the next few
                            years, and it is likely that a primary interest on their part will be to
                            assure that this country does not continue to monopolize the system
                            indefinitely. With some variations in attitude from country to country,
                            the European delegations are likely to press hard for assurances on the
                            ultimate organizational structure. This may be the price that they
                            demand for permitting the Corporation to manage the interim system.</p>
                        <pb n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0153"/>
                        <p>As to <hi rend="italic">interim arrangements</hi>, for a commercially
                            viable system it is desirable that there be some form of European
                                participation.<note n="2" xml:id="d63fn2">Telegram 3775 from Paris,
                                February 7, reported that the French, for example, “made much of
                                point that GOF [Government of France] could not and would not treat
                                communications satellite problems as solely telecommunications
                                affairs. Emphasized repeatedly that strong national interests are
                                involved.” (Ibid.)</note> Originally both the Corporation and the
                            United States Government thought exclusively in terms of European
                            participation through capital investment in the system from the
                            beginning, either on behalf of the Conference or by several individual
                            European countries. As the Corporation's plans matured and the prospect
                            of an “experimental/operational” capability in 1965 emerged, a number of
                            European countries expressed interest in participating at this stage by
                            leasing channels rather than by making a capital investment. Recently,
                            at a technical meeting in Karlsruhe, European interest in capital
                            investment from the beginning has again emerged, largely as a result of
                            an indication that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would be
                            prepared to invest. Investment and channel leasing are not mutually
                            exclusive; discussions and negotiations could proceed on both forms of
                            arrangement simultaneously.</p>
                        <p>It is obvious that arrangements for rental of channels in the 1965
                            limited capability would be simpler to negotiate and would retain
                            maximum managerial control in the United States. At the same time, if a
                            number of European countries indicate that they may be prepared to make
                            an investment commitment now in the over-all <gloss target="#t_CSC1"
                                >CSC</gloss> program, we will want to discuss interim organizational
                            arrangements permitting such investment. These arrangements would be
                            somewhat more complicated, but they would have to be simple enough to
                            operate efficiently and to be compatible with the over-riding United
                            States interest in developing a system as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>The United States has on several occasions asked the Soviet Union if it
                            wished to discuss a communication satellite system. An Aide-Mémoire in
                            February 1963 suggested exploratory talks, there were probes at the
                                <gloss target="#t_ITU1">ITU</gloss> Space Communication Conference,
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> approached
                            Gromyko on the subject in November, and approaches were made in December
                            at the UN. The Soviet Union has not responded affirmatively to any of
                            these. The Europeans are likely to ask for our views on Soviet
                            participation in a communication satellite system. The delegation is
                            authorized to point out that the United States is committed to seek a
                            single global system, and that this implies Soviet participation as a
                            desirable objective. However, the United States will be guided by the
                            principle that the development of the system should not be delayed by
                            the unwillingness of <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0154"/>the Soviet
                            Union to participate, or by unproductive negotiations with the Soviet
                            Union.</p>

                            covering these services (Tab 1).<note n="3" xml:id="d64fn3">Neither tab
                                was attached.</note> The Corporation's Board of Directors and
                            management favor entering into the arrangement. They believe that it
                            must also be acceptable to the communications common carriers and the
                            key European countries interested in investing in the global system.
                            Discussions with these parties and appropriate Congressional Committees
                            are in process.</p>
                        <p>The terms of the Memorandum are substantially agreed upon. An outstanding
                            question with respect to frequency allocation is still being resolved.
                            The Memorandum makes provision for adequate satellite services to be
                            supplied for the <gloss target="#t_NCS1">NCS</gloss> if it should
                            develop that the global <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0155"/>system
                            the Corporation decides to deploy is not suitable for the Government's
                            needs.</p>
                        <p>Inasmuch as the Memorandum of Understanding deals with the satellite
                            circuits required for the entire <gloss target="#t_NCS1">NCS</gloss>, it
                            would be preferable that the Memorandum be executed by the Secretary of
                            Defense as Executive Agent for the <gloss target="#t_NCS1">NCS</gloss>.
                            This would permit the arrangements for the Government's procurement of
                            such services to be integrated with anticipated arrangements for the
                            participation of other governments in the global system which may result
                            from discussions being carried on with foreign governments by the
                            Corporation and the Department of State. Accordingly, I have prepared
                            for your approval Tab 2 which would authorize the Secretary of Defense,
                            as Executive Agent for the <gloss target="#t_NCS1">NCS</gloss>, to sign
                            the Memorandum of Understanding on behalf of the Government. Previous
                            directives are not explicit in giving this power to the Secretary of
                            Defense. The Ad Hoc Committee Group on Satellite Communications concurs
                            in this course of action.</p>

                                (<gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>) and the Corporation regarding
                            a shared commercial-United States Government communication satellite
                            system. They also showed and discussed the draft Interim Agreement
                            relating to arrangements for international participation in the system,
                            which had been prepared for the February 10 Rome Conference.</p>
                        <p>The European Conference on Communication Satellites met in London Friday
                            and Saturday. Lee Marks returned home via London <pb n="126"
                                xml:id="pg_126" facs="0156"/>and talked with Mr.

                                >UK</gloss> Foreign Ministry, about the Conference.</p>
                        <p>Two issues emerged—the nature of the proposed U.S. Government-Corporation
                            “deal”, and the form and timing of negotiations on the draft Interim
                            Agreement.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">1. The U.S. Government-Corporation “deal”.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Europeans did not react strongly to the proposed deal. They
                            questioned whether it was technically possible to use one satellite
                            system to meet both commercial needs and those of the U.S. Government,
                            and they questioned whether it was politically saleable. Hope-Jones told
                            Lee Marks Saturday that the European Conference had discussed the
                            proposal briefly and decided it was a “political non-starter”. Sweden
                            and Austria reportedly said flatly they could not participate in a
                            system one-half of which was reserved exclusively for the U.S. military
                            needs.</p>
                        <p>I believe the U.S. Government and the Corporation could nonetheless
                            conclude a Memorandum of Understanding if it was properly drafted and
                            presented. It is important that we not lead Congress or the Europeans to
                            believe that the deal gives the Government the right to use half of a
                            24-satellite medium-altitude random-orbit system if that is the system
                            deployed. Rather, the deal must provide a series of options—i.e., shared
                            system, Corporation deployment of a separate system for the
                            Government—all subject to suitable arrangements being worked out. The
                            present draft of the Memorandum of Understanding should probably be
                            altered to make this clear. Mr. <persName>Friedman</persName> and Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJV1">Charyk</persName> see this point
                            clearly. We do not know what Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                >McNamara</persName>'s views are. This issue is complicated because
                            the Military Operations Sub Committee (headed by Chet Holifield) of the
                            Government Operations Committee begins two weeks of hearings on <gloss

                        </p>
                        <p>As you will recall, the Europeans proposed at the Rome meeting that a
                            group representing the European Conference come to the United States to
                            negotiate in mid-March or early April. Although we agreed to this
                            approach in Rome, upon reconsideration, the Corporation decided that it
                            did not like this and we thereupon declined to set a date for the
                            negotiating meeting. My reply to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_OE3"

                                difficult to prepare for and carry out the proposed negotiations,”

                                United States that they will be pursuing a common aim in these
                                negotiations, and that they are determined to negotiate in
                                common.”</note> was sent from London last week end. It rejects our
                            proposal and asks for an early “informal” conference. We must now reply
                            to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_OE3">Ortona</persName>'s letter.</p>
                        <p>The Corporation prefers to negotiate bilaterally, although as a result of
                            the trip last week, it may now realize that this is simply not possible.
                            Alternatively, it would like to talk to a small group of countries. It
                            doesn't want to deal with the Conference as such, or with a group of
                            countries on behalf of the Conference. The Europeans have a strong
                            political stake in the European Conference and seem so far to have
                            achieved a high degree of unity. (Hope-Jones told Lee Marks in London
                            that the British and French Governments, at “the highest levels,”
                            considered the political stake “enormous” because “we and the French
                            agree on every point and together we are leading the rest of Europe.”)
                            Moreover, they are generally irritated at the Corporation's insistence
                            on bilateral talks and on what they believe to be the brush-off of my
                            letter to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_OE3">Ortona</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The issue is how strongly we should press the Corporation to accept
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_OE3">Ortona</persName>'s proposal or to
                            make a reasonable counter-proposal. Our problem, of course, is that if
                            we press the Corporation to negotiate we will bear the onus for what
                            comes out of the negotiations; and the issues of State Department
                            involvement that were discussed so heatedly during the legislative
                            battle over the Act, and that have popped up from time to time in recent
                            months, will be raised again. Predominant congressional feeling is
                            undoubtedly that the less State Department involvement the better. The
                                <gloss target="#t_FCC1">FCC</gloss> Staff, and several of the
                            Commissioners (though not the Chairman) share this view.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> has an interest in
                            this issue since the success of its deal, and indeed of a separate
                            communication satellite system, may depend on not irritating the
                            Europeans unnecessarily. A joint approach to the Corporation by State
                            and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> might be possible.</p>
                        <p>These issues will probably have to be resolved in the next few days.

                            for discussion of a global communications satellite system. The United
                            States had first proposed an exploratory exchange of views with the
                            Soviet Union in February 1963. In a March 30 memorandum for Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_CAJ1">Abram Chayes</persName> speculated that Soviet
                            interest was related to the ongoing U.S. discussions with the
                            Communications Satellite Corporation (<gloss target="#t_COMSAT1"
                                >COMSAT</gloss>) and the European Conference on Satellite
                            Communication. He recommended that the talks take place in June. “By
                            that time, our negotiations with the Europeans and others should have
                            advanced sufficiently so that the risks of Soviet participation would be
                            minimal.” (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Records
                            of the Department of State, Central Files, 1964–66, TEL 6)</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union's interest in the U.S.-European negotiations was strong.
                            In April a Soviet Embassy official asked <persName corresp="#p_CJV1"
                                >Joseph Charyk</persName>, President of <gloss target="#t_COMSAT1"
                                >COMSAT</gloss>, about the progress of the talks. “Mr.
                                <persName>Karpov</persName> then indicated that it was his
                            understanding that we were having a difficult time negotiating with the
                            European countries and that as a matter of fact this had been described
                            as a 'telephone war.' <persName corresp="#p_CJV1">Charyk</persName>
                            assured him that there was great interest on the part of the Europeans.”

                        <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>I take this opportunity to convey to you my deep concern over recent
                            developments in the Government's program for satellite communications.
                            My Military Operations Subcommittee has been holding extensive hearings
                            on this subject, updating some earlier work in this field.</p>
                        <p>In April of last year, General <persName corresp="#p_SAD2"
                                >Starbird</persName> of the Defense Communications Agency told us
                            about the Defense Department plans for a medium <pb n="129"
                                xml:id="pg_129" facs="0159"/>altitude random orbit system of
                            satellite communications. The Defense Department has been ready for some
                            time to build such a system, but the project has been held up since at
                            least October 1963, when Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                >McNamara</persName> decided to explore with the Communications
                            Satellite Corporation the possibility of a joint military-commercial
                            system operation.</p>
                        <p>Many months have been consumed in technical and policy discussions.
                            Numerous options have been analyzed, numerous proposals made and
                            discarded. Several drafts of an “agreement” between the Department and
                            the Corporation have been formulated, the latest of which is now before
                            the Corporation for approval or, possibly, further negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Even if an “agreement” is entered into, the Defense Department will not
                            know until October 1965 whether the Corporation is prepared to meet its
                            requirements. The Corporation may decide the military tie-in is not
                            profitable because of added satellite weight and complexity. The
                            Corporation may go synchronous, in which case the military
                            specifications will not be met. Or the Corporation may find that its
                            foreign partners object to the military tie-in, in which case the State
                            Department will not approve it. Our hearings have made it clear that a
                            time delay of a year or more would be involved if the Department waits
                            on the Corporation to decide what system it wants to choose.</p>
                        <p>While it appears, through the testimony and our other investigations,
                            that most of the civilian and military experts in Government
                            communications are opposed to a shared system operation, or at least
                            have serious reservations about it (because the operating advantages are
                            nil and the economies dubious), the Defense Department is still trying
                            to work out an agreement. Possibly an agreement has this attraction—that
                            public capital outlays on satellite communications will not be necessary
                            for the next several budget years. And later, the Defense Department
                            will pay off that portion of the Corporation's investment required for
                            special Government purposes by paying yearly rates for services approved
                            by the Federal Communications Commission. From the Corporation's
                            standpoint, presumably there is an advantage in having a “built-in”
                            major customer committed several years in advance of system
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>The hearings impel me to seriously question whether the long-range
                            interests of the United States will be served by associating the most
                            sensitive military and other essential Government requirements for
                            satellite communications with the business requirements of a commercial
                            corporation which must pay dividends to stockholders. I see all kinds of
                            political and international implications. For the next few years the
                            Corporation will be deeply involved in transactions and arrangements
                            with domestic and foreign carriers and in devising a system operation
                            which will produce revenues in competition with <pb n="130"
                                xml:id="pg_130" facs="0160"/>cable and other communications systems.
                            Can the Government afford to hold up while these complicated problems
                            are being solved—a lengthy process which entails numerous international
                            negotiations, regulatory agency proceedings, and other involvements?
                            Indeed, the Government adds to the Corporation's domestic and
                            international problems by the proposed tie-in.</p>
                        <p>The Cuban crisis showed how seriously deficient we were in our
                            communications, and the directive for a National Communications System
                            was President Kennedy's immediate response to these deficiencies. While
                            the Government now buys communications services from carriers and will
                            buy such services from the Corporation in the future, it seems to be the
                            better part of wisdom for the Government, without further delay, to move
                            ahead with its own hard-core military system, already carefully studied,
                            already designed and engineered.</p>
                        <p>I trust you will give this matter your personal attention.<note n="2"

                                among the White House staff. Special Assistant Joseph Califano and
                                Deputy Secretary of Defense Cyrus Vance urged Lawrence O'Brien to
                                sign a letter to the Congressman, reassuring him that “The present
                                shared satellite design meets all of the important technical and
                                operational requirements that would also be met by an independent
                                Government design.” (Memorandum from Califano to O'Brien, June 10;

                                that the proposed response “is not fully responsive to the
                                Congressman's letter.” Welsh also pointed out that the Department of
                                Defense proposal “would make the whole problem more difficult for
                                the State Department.” Welsh noted that “In fact, it would be better
                                not to send any further response than to send the one proposed.”

                        <p>In late June and early July 1964, the discussions of the <gloss
                                target="#t_COMSAT1">COMSAT</gloss>-Department of Defense joint
                            satellite project continued. In a long memorandum for the President,
                            General James O'Connell, the President's Special Assistant for
                            Telecommunications, laid out the issue: “Top echelons of <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_COMSAT1"
                                >COMSAT</gloss> both want this agreement for financial and other
                            reasons.” He explained: “If we seek to look at this mixed system from
                            the viewpoint of world opinion, the <gloss target="#t_COMSAT1"
                                >COMSAT</gloss> Act of 1962 proposed to the world a global system
                            for peaceful use. No matter how much we wish to disguise the fact, it is
                            clear that the U.S. military will have the use of half the system and is
                            attempting to provide financial and other inducements to bring about a
                                <gloss target="#t_COMSAT1">COMSAT</gloss> and consortium decision to
                            adopt the type of system the Defense Department desires. Such a setup
                            can have the tendency to drive out other countries and reduce the
                            possibility that there will be a truly global system. In any case, our
                            position as advocating and promoting a peaceful global system appears
                            hypocritical. Another view which foreign nations may take with some
                            logic is that our Defense Department exercises such decisive influence
                            on our national objectives as to have changed the originally stated
                            purposes of our global <gloss target="#t_COMSAT1">COMSAT</gloss>
                            network.”</p>
                        <p>O'Connell concluded that the United States could have a more flexible
                            communications system if the Department of Defense network was separate,
                            and he cautioned: “We are taking a step right now which has very large
                            implications with regard to the future of communication satellites in
                            the world. Irrevocable decisions can be made now which, while having
                            relatively little impact in the short run, may have long-range impact on
                            our world position.” He argued: “The change in worldwide public image of
                            our <gloss target="#t_COMSAT1">COMSAT</gloss> system is an important
                            consideration. A global commercial system dedicated to increasing world
                            understanding, and for the equal opportunity of use by all nations, is
                            the image we have sought to create. It does not seem credible that all
                            nations could think that equal opportunity is practical when the U.S.
                            military has nearly half the potential of each satellite.”</p>
                        <p>Summing up, he noted that “the proposed agreement, because of a
                            preponderance of negative long-range potential consequences, presents
                            hazards which are virtually impossible adequately to evaluate and is
                            therefore not the best choice for the United States Government.”

                            our position on peaceful uses of space would at least be greatly
                            weakened in the eyes of the world.” (Ibid.)</p>

                        <p>The Communications Satellite Conference convened in Washington on July
                            21, 1964, and concluded an intergovernmental agreement that established
                            organizational principles for the system and another agreement that
                            provided for the commercial, financial, and technical operations of the
                            system. The latter would be signed by <gloss target="#t_COMSAT1"
                                >COMSAT</gloss> on behalf of the United States. Together, the two
                            agreements provided a framework for a global commercial communication

                            O'Connell, in a July 28 memorandum for the record, described the
                            problems: “many [Board members] were outspoken in their disagreement
                            with actions taken by the management; the philosophy of the
                            international consortium; the details of the international agreements;
                            lack of information which had been furnished to the Board in the past;
                            [and] pressure which had been put on the Board to make decisions
                            prematurely or too rapidly.” (Ibid.) In a July 28 memorandum for
                                <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName>, O'Connell
                            foresaw the possibility for “further adverse action,” including
                            “Rejection by the Board of the International Agreement in toto and
                            recommendation for unilateral U.S. action to put up a <gloss

                        </p>
                        <p>It is the policy of the United States to support the development of a
                            single global commercial communications satellite system to provide
                            common carrier and public service communications. The intent of the
                            United States to exploit space technology for the service of all
                            mankind, and to promote its use in support of peace, understanding and
                            world order has been stated clearly in legislation and in Administration
                            speeches and official releases. The U.S. Government is committed to use
                            global commercial communications facilities for general governmental
                            communications purposes wherever commercial circuits of the type and
                            quality needed to meet government requirements can be made available on
                            a timely basis and in accordance with applicable tariff or, in the
                            absence of Federal Communications Commission jurisdiction, at reasonable
                            cost. Separate satellite communications facilities including surface
                            terminals may be established and maintained by the U.S. Government to
                            meet those unique and vital national security needs which cannot be met
                            by commercial facilities. The capacity of these separate facilities
                            shall at all times be limited to that essential to meet such unique
                            needs. These policies underlie the spirit and the letter of the
                            Communications Satellite Act of 1962, its legislative history and the
                            position of the United States in the negotiations leading to the signing
                            of agreements establishing interim arrangements for a global commercial
                            communications satellite system.</p>
                        <p>Provisions for the establishment of the global commercial communications
                            satellite system and a U.S. national defense communications satellite
                            system consistent with these policies have now advanced to the point
                            where it is desirable to amplify and interpret these policies in order
                            to guide United States relations with other countries in the development
                            of communications satellite capabilities, and particularly with respect
                            to providing technology and assistance therefor.</p>

                        <p>Most major countries of the World other than the United States provide
                            international public communications services through governmental

                            owned by the government. Assistance to any of these foreign governments
                            in the development of communications satellite systems can potentially
                            develop competitors seeking to divert traffic from the single global
                            system being developed by the international consortium established as a
                            result of U.S. actions initiated by the Communications Satellite Act of
                            1962 and now joined by forty-six nations.</p>
                        <p>The communications satellite activities of U.S. Government agencies,
                            including the Department of Defense and the National Aeronautics and
                            Space Administration, have an important bearing on the U.S. support of
                            the objectives of the Communications Satellite Act of 1962. These

                                    For example, the United Kingdom has indicated its need for
                                    highly reliable satellite communications from England to

                                    rather than to develop independent systems and to accommodate
                                    allied needs within the U.S. system (with additional costs
                                    normally to be borne by the participants). Recognized needs
                                    should be restricted to those, similar to ours, which are vital
                                    to the national security of the selected allied nations and
                                    which cannot be met by commercial facilities. To accommodate the
                                    needs within the U.S. national defense system it may prove
                                    necessary to include one or more satellites, synchronous or
                                    otherwise, whether of the same or different design. In this
                                    case, such satellite(s) should be designed to be electronically

                                    defense communications satellite system in order to permit

                            States. To attempt to provide such service by a government-owned system
                            would be contrary to established U.S. national policy and international
                            agreement. Direct aid to the Communications Satellite Corporation and
                            the international consortium might be politically criticized as
                            subsidy.</p>

                        <p>There is a possibility that the Soviet Union may act soon to assist

                        <p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has stated an urgent

                            to meet this requirement.</p>

                                Telegram 3382 from Paris, December 14, reported “considerable
                                enthusiasm at the UNESCO experts meeting about the potential of
                                communications satellites.” The U.S. experts in attendance
                                recommended an educational pilot project as soon as possible. The
                                Soviets expressed keen interest, and a U.S. delegation member
                                emphasized that such a project “would unquestionably be of historic
                                significance and command worldwide attention.” The Ambassador added,
                                “I strongly recommend you explore such a pilot educational satellite
                                project as a means of dramatizing President's new international
                                education program.” (Ibid.) The Department's response in telegram
                                2385 to Paris, November 30, included: “FYI—Because deliberations

                        <p>The Communications Satellite Act of 1962 was based on the premise that
                            the United States would take the initiative in creating a global
                            communications satellite system.</p>
                        <p>The Act contemplates that the communications satellite system will be
                            worldwide in coverage, directed towards providing communications service
                            “to economically less-developed countries and areas as well as those
                            more highly developed.” It provides that the President shall see that
                            such objectives are attained in a manner consistent with the national
                            interest and foreign policy of the United States. In the policy
                            statement which preceded the passage of the Act itself, President
                            Kennedy stated that the system should include “service where individual
                            portions of the coverage are not profitable.”</p>
                        <p>The Act provides that this mandate be carried out within a unique
                            framework of U.S. commercial enterprise in conjunction with comparable
                            private or governmental organizations throughout the world. Within this
                            framework the global satellite system is being established by an
                            international consortium, now joined by 48 nations and managed by the
                            U.S. Communications Satellite Corporation (<gloss target="#t_COMSAT1"
                                >COMSAT</gloss>) which controls a 55.37 percent interest in the
                            consortium. Consortium membership is open to all countries belonging to
                            the International Telecommunications Union. Although it has a majority
                            ownership, <gloss target="#t_COMSAT1">COMSAT</gloss> is restricted in
                            establishing certain policies for the system without the concurrence of
                            additional nations. The establishment of earth stations and thus the
                            provision of access to the global system is the responsibility of the
                            nations desiring access.</p>
                        <p>These provisions have important implications for the President's
                            responsibility to create a global satellite system, particularly in
                            less-developed countries. As business ventures, the <gloss
                                target="#t_COMSAT1">COMSAT</gloss> Corporation and members of the
                            consortium are not likely to subsidize earth stations and related
                            activities in these countries unless profitable operations are
                            forecast.</p>
                        <p>By the end of 1966, the consortium, managed by <gloss target="#t_COMSAT1"
                                >COMSAT</gloss>, will have launched communications satellites in a
                            pattern that will cover three-quarters of the globe. These satellites
                            will provide an essentially worldwide network of telephone, telex, radio
                            or TV links. However, while the satellites will be available, complete
                            global participation will not be possible until earth stations are
                            established in both developed and less-developed areas. The present
                            prospect is that only a handful of less-developed countries will have
                            earth stations within the next few years.</p>

                            their own resources, stressing the many benefits of direct access to the

                            <p>As you know, the basic decision to award the construction contract
                                for the satellites to TRW was made by the <gloss

                                directed <gloss target="#t_COMSAT1">COMSAT</gloss>, as the manager

                                proceed with definitive negotiations with TRW. This basic decision
                                was made after full consideration of competing proposals submitted
                                by Hughes Aircraft Company and Radio Corporation of America.</p>
                            <p>On March 15, 1966, during the negotiations between <gloss

                                13, 1966, nevertheless, authorized the manager to execute the
                                proposed contract with TRW. On April 27, 1966, therefore, the
                                proposed contract was filed with the <gloss target="#t_FCC1"

                                constituted by an international agreement to which the United States
                                is a signatory. In view of the responsibilities for the satellite
                                program which have been delegated to me by the President I feel
                                obligated to make my serious concern known to the Commission.
                                Basically, I am concerned because if the matter is not soon decided
                                by the <gloss target="#t_FCC1">FCC</gloss>, I believe that United
                                States interests will be irreparably harmed with serious residual
                                damage to the United States in the international discussions on the
                                permanent satellite system and organization when these are held.</p>
                            <p>In commenting, I am fully aware that the Communications Satellite Act
                                of 1962 establishes <gloss target="#t_FCC1">FCC</gloss> jurisdiction
                                over <gloss target="#t_COMSAT1">COMSAT</gloss> as a United States
                                entity. However, the Act does not appear to contemplate the role
                                which <gloss target="#t_COMSAT1">COMSAT</gloss> must play as the
                                elected manager of an international partnership, with responsibility
                                for implementing policy decisions of the designated governing
                                instrument of the partnership.</p>
                            <p>It would be most helpful if the Commission could expedite review of
                                the <gloss target="#t_COMSAT1">COMSAT</gloss> filing. In order to
                                avoid the possibility of further problems of this nature it would
                                also be most helpful if the Commission could give favorable
                                consideration to the adoption of rules and procedures which would
                                clearly delineate the differences between <gloss target="#t_COMSAT1"
                                    >COMSAT</gloss> as a domestic corporation and as the manager of
                                an international consortium and which would prevent possible future
                                claims that the Commission's procedures have delayed the progress of
                                    <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss> in achieving a
                                global system.</p>
                            <p>If the Commission feels that it is not possible or advisable to adopt
                                such procedures, I would recommend that remedial legislation be
                                enacted without delay.</p>

                            that in cases involving United States financial or technical assistance,

                        </p>
                        <p>1. Prospects for early construction of earth stations are quite good in a
                            few less-developed countries. In most <gloss target="#t_LDC1"
                                >LDC</gloss>s, however, stations will not be built on a timely basis
                            without some active United States governmental encouragement.</p>
                        <p>2. The absence of earth stations in <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>s
                            to date is not particularly surprising. The basic characteristics of the
                            satellites to be used in the global system (and thus the required earth
                            stations) were not determined until April 1966 after experience with
                            Early Bird had been evaluated. Moreover, earth stations make no sense in
                            many of the poorer <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>s which lack the
                            requisite local communication system.</p>
                        <p>3. In any program of assistance by the United States to extend the global
                            system to less-developed countries the following countries should be
                            given priority:</p>

                        <p>The criteria used in the selection of these countries are set out in
                            Annex III.<note n="4" xml:id="d86fn4">Not printed.</note>

                        <p>4. There are three principal factors which tend to slow down the
                            establishment of earth stations in developing countries. First, these
                            countries require time to make the decision to build a station. This is
                            not surprising considering how new this development is and the
                            difficulty of allocating scarce resources. Second, the countries
                            frequently have difficulty in determining the national policy as to the
                            ownership of these stations—should they be nationally owned or should
                            foreign interests be encouraged to participate in the ownership. Third,
                            as earth stations involve a foreign exchange cost of $3 to $5 million,
                            many countries will require some financial assistance.</p>

                        <p>5. The United States can help overcome the first and last of these three
                            obstacles, and has indeed begun to do so. Through discussions with
                            Embassy officials and visits from technical experts from <gloss
                                target="#t_COMSAT1">Comsat</gloss> Corporation and other United
                            States companies, as well as by sponsorship of an international seminar
                            on earth station technology, the United States has helped the <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>s understand how the global system
                            functions and the kind of earth stations that are needed by such
                            systems. In the area of financial assistance, the United States has
                            indicated to Ethiopia, Nigeria and the three East African Common
                            Services nations willingness to consider assistance via the
                            Export-Import Bank or A.I.D. A fuller description of United States
                            activities to date is attached in Annex IV.</p>
                        <p>6. The United States Government is by no means the only source of

                        <p>Financing plans generally contemplate that the country will finance the
                            local current component. A few countries, such as Brazil and the
                            Philippines, may also be able to finance all or a part of the foreign
                            exchange requirements. A discussion of each of these sources is attached

                        <p>7. Firm decisions to build and finance earth stations will take some
                            additional time—both for the <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>s
                            involved and the potential sources of financial help. If it were vital
                            that earth stations be constructed in the priority countries not just in
                            the near future but on a crash basis, the United States could achieve
                            this goal best by not waiting for other sources but rather by strong
                            promotional efforts of the Export-Import Bank or, more likely, direct
                            offers of A.I.D. assistance. This does not seem to be a necessary or
                            desirable course of action. The field of satellite communication is so
                            glamorous, the general interest so high, and the various plans for earth
                            stations are being so actively pursued, that in most of the countries on
                            the priority list other forms of financing will probably become
                            available in the relatively near future. The reason A.I.D. has expressed
                            willingness to help the African countries referred to in paragraph 5 is
                            that these seemed to be unlikely to obtain other forms of assistance.
                            For the same reason A.I.D. is prepared to consider possible assistance
                            to Turkey, Pakistan and Korea, in each case with appropriate
                            Export-Import Bank coordination. A country by country <pb n="162"

                            determined: (a) The countries recommended for inclusion in this program

                            accelerated construction of earth stations and related facilities.

                        <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. <persName>O'Connell</persName>:</p>
                        <p>At the March 23 meeting of the National Aeronautics and Space Council,
                            the Vice President asked members to examine our objectives <pb n="165"
                                xml:id="pg_165" facs="0195"/>and programs for international
                            cooperation in space to see if proposals might be developed for making
                            such cooperation even more effective than it is. On that occasion the
                            Vice President appointed a subcommittee under the Chairmanship of the
                            State Department and requested that each member of the Council submit to
                            it his ideas on this important subject.</p>
                        <p>In pursuance of the directive from the Vice President the Department has
                            in cooperation with other agencies of the Government, including your
                            office, reviewed a number of possibilities for expanded international
                            cooperation in space matters. During the course of this review it has
                            become evident that NSAM 338,<note n="2" xml:id="d88fn2">
                                <ref target="#d75">Document 75</ref>.</note> which established
                            policy concerning United States assistance in the development of foreign
                            communications satellite capabilities should be reviewed in light of
                            recent developments.</p>
                        <p>NSAM 338, which has served well as an instrument of non-proliferation for
                            both commercial and unique governmental communications satellite
                            systems, by the same token limits the flow of advanced technology from
                            the United States to foreign countries. It has become apparent in recent
                            months that the restrictive aspects of NSAM 338 have become a political
                            irritant to a number of European countries and are serving to limit the
                            effectiveness of international cooperation in space matters to a degree
                            no longer justifiable.</p>
                        <p>Under the circumstances, and as provided in the last paragraph of NSAM
                            338, the Department requests that a review of the NSAM be undertaken and
                            especially of those provisions which relate to the export of
                            communications satellite technology.</p>

                            in an October 3 letter to O'Connell: “There is no doubt in our mind that
                            this has fostered an impression of obstructionism on the part of the
                            United States, exacerbating existing political strains and prejudicing

                                >Webb</persName> was also concerned about the continued U.S.

                            the Europeans an opportunity to improve their competitive position and
                            win contracts. “Such an impression serves to support the arguments of
                            particular countries that only the establishment of independent European
                            systems can relieve the situation.” (<persName>Johnson</persName>

                        <p>Officials in the U.S. Embassy in London reported on November 9 that the
                            benefits of a change would have a psychological impact rather than cause
                            a real technological advance. “It is believed most countries are
                            basically concerned with industrial aspects and are quite content with
                            single system concept so long as they obtain fair slice of the equipment
                            cake.” (Telegram 3872 from London, November 9; National Archives and
                            Records Administration, RG 59, Records of the Department of State,
                            Central Files, 1964–66, TEL 6)</p>
                        <p>The Embassy in Bonn warned on November 14 that German industrial
                            officials believed that the United States was “not sincere in our
                            repeated offers to collaborate in advanced technology” and to work with
                            the Europeans, treating them as “equal and respected partners.” While
                            official German support for <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1"
                                >Intelsat</gloss> was strong, the Embassy warned: “The potentially
                            damaging effect that our restrictive <gloss target="#t_COMSAT1"
                                >Comsat</gloss> policy could have on our relations with the FRG
                            should not be obscured by the relatively minor reaction noted in Germany
                            so far.” It seemed like a contradiction, the telegram noted, between
                            “the warm US reception given the Italian Technology Gap initiative” and
                            “what would seem to be an effort to preserve and even broaden the
                            technology gap in the vital communication area.” (Telegram 5840 from

                            regarding Communications Satellite Policy: <list>
                                <item>First of all, the countries with some technological competence
                                    are going to insist on participating in the communications
                                    technology and, if possible, in the actual production of some of
                                    the hardware that goes into an international or regional system.
                                    So we might just as well recognize that fact and lessen
                                    substantially the restraints against the export of
                                    technology.</item>
                                <item>Second, some areas around the world, such as Western Europe
                                    for example, are going to develop regional communications
                                    systems. I suggest that we recognize this eventuality and
                                    develop our policy in such fashion that it would encourage the
                                    compatibility of such regional systems with the international
                                    system. There is no reason to pretend that such regional systems
                                    will not develop, so why not make the most of it and encourage
                                    them to become associated with the international system. If we
                                    do not, I would expect that the international system will be the
                                    one which breaks up and fails.</item>
                                <item>Third, I see no reason why the United States should not have a
                                    regional system, including Canada and Mexico, for example. It
                                    makes sense to have such a system handled by the <gloss
                                        target="#t_COMSAT1">ComSat</gloss> Corp. and the system be
                                    compatible and associated with the international system.</item>
                                <item>Fourth, not only is it in accord with the law but it also is
                                    in accord with good management to have the <gloss
                                        target="#t_COMSAT1">ComSat</gloss> Corp. contract directly
                                    with the United States government, if <gloss target="#t_COMSAT1"
                                        >ComSat</gloss> Corp. is in fact the low bidder and can meet
                                    the requirements.</item>

                        <p>On June 30, 1966, the Department of State and the Agency for
                            International Development submitted a report (Annex IV)<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d91fn2">Annex IV was not found attached. Regarding the June

                            directed that active steps be taken to encourage construction of earth

                            and/or regions should be given priority in any program of assistance by
                            the United States. The list of countries or areas selected for this

                                <item>That the United States continue its present program of

                                    financing for earth stations in those countries on the priority

                                    terms and that the project satisfies development loan
                                    criteria.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>That State and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> keep
                                    abreast of the progress in the construction of earth stations,
                                    and plans for such construction, and by January 1, 1967 report
                                    to you (a) the status of earth station construction in the
                                    priority countries, (b) whether, generally, anticipated
                                    assistance from non-United States Government sources has indeed
                                    materialized, and (c) what, if any further United States
                                    Government action should be taken.</item>

                        </p>
                        <p>While progress in establishing earth stations in the selected <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>s has not been uniform, progress is
                            being made. Annex I provides an up-to-date status report on each
                            priority country and/or area. Annex II shows earth station planning in
                            areas other than the priority group. These Annexes clearly indicate that
                            there has been considerable movement during the past six months and that
                            this movement is widespread.</p>
                        <p>We conclude that the intentions and plans of many countries with respect
                            to satellite communications jelled during this period. <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss> interest is shown not only by earth
                            station developments, but also by the number of countries that joined
                                <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss> and those about to
                            become members. Annex III provides the names of these countries.</p>
                        <p>Financing does not appear to have been the real problem in moving along
                            earth station programs, although it was an element; rather,
                            organizational and technical problems have held up some decision making
                            by the developing countries. The critical element is to develop some
                            national momentum toward establishing an earth station; once this is
                            done, countries seem to move along with their plans without undue delay.
                            This momentum was furthered by the United States in various ways. The
                            Department of State's Seminar on Earth Station Technology, held in
                            Washington in May 1966 was clearly a help; repeated visits by officials
                            of the Communications Satellite Corporation, and to a lesser degree by
                            other United States international telecommunications carriers and by
                            American manufacturers, also helped; so did the efforts made by our
                            missions abroad. All were designed to educate the developing countries
                            about the benefits of communications via satellites and all constituted
                            significant factors in developing this momentum.</p>
                        <p>In making the satellite communications system an operable one, the major
                            effort remains, however, the rapid emplacement of earth stations so that
                            the satellites can be put to use as they become available. <pb n="170"
                                xml:id="pg_170" facs="0200"/>We do not believe the recent failure to
                            place the <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss> II Pacific
                            satellite in a synchronous orbit will materially delay the system. In
                            any case, new launches are now scheduled for early in the new year.
                            Moreover, production of the <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1"
                                >INTELSAT</gloss> III satellite series is on schedule and these
                            satellites should be in orbit early in 1968.</p>
                        <p>In order to insure that earth station construction proceeds in a positive
                            way, we believe it prudent to continue to encourage and stimulate
                            interest, as well as to render financial and technical assistance as is
                            necessary and appropriate on a case-by-case basis. During the past six
                            months, the IBRD, IADB and the Ex-Im Bank have all become involved in
                            financing of earth stations. It appears these financial sources are
                            available for financing stations where the economic viability of the
                            installation is reasonably good. We do not believe that any special
                            persuasion needs be made at this time, although developments will be
                            closely followed.</p>
                        <p>With regard to two of the selected countries, it appears that Korea will
                            need assistance from the Ex-Im Bank, IBRD or <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                >AID</gloss>. A similar situation prevails in Pakistan. Moreover, as
                            it now appears likely Iran will forge ahead of Turkey in joining the
                            consortium and in establishing an earth station, we believe the previous
                            selection of Turkey should be dropped or changed in favor of Iran. An
                            earth station in Iran (with one scheduled in Greece) should be adequate
                            for this area, taking into account the existing high quality CENTO
                            microwave facilities (financed by <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>)
                            linking together Turkey, Iran and Pakistan.</p>

                        <p>The national policy established by the President and the Congress is to
                            give first priority to the successful achievement of a single

                            policy which makes paramount the objectives of world peace and
                            understanding. The importance of the single global system to achieve
                            these objectives cannot be overemphasized. Executive Branch departments
                            are working diligently to reduce the hazards and obtain the objectives
                            sought by the Communications Satellite Act, but success is far from

                        <p>Recent analysis of the status of <gloss target="#t_COMSAT1"
                                >COMSAT</gloss> and of <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1"
                            >INTELSAT</gloss>, and indeed of international telecommunications in
                            general, has led me to conclude that there are increasingly serious
                            threats to the future success and viability of both <gloss

                        <p>The motivations and the ongoing actions in response to them by many
                            interests have such serious potentials that I have prepared and
                            submitted to the President a memorandum expressing my concerns. A copy
                            of this memorandum is attached.<note n="2" xml:id="d94fn2">

                        </p>
                        <p>The purpose of this letter is to focus more sharply upon those critical
                            issues which appear to me to require prompt and continuous action.</p>
                        <p>A variety of motives and incentives are leading certain nations to
                            conclude that it may be in their best interests to establish regional
                            satellite communications systems separate from and independent of the
                                <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss> system. That one of
                            the incentives relates to maintaining or achieving greater financial
                            returns is apparent. Equally apparent is the fact that the unique
                            promises of satellite technology for effecting greater international
                            understanding and for promoting the social, political, and economic
                            growth of less developed nations will be subverted to the narrower
                            interests of national prestige, political influence, and unilateral
                            economic gains at the expense of greater growth, lower costs, and better
                            service for all nations.</p>
                        <p>The French, for example, are moving aggressively in the direction of
                            establishing a European-African regional system which could contribute
                            to her quest for hegemony in Europe and would strengthen her traditional
                            political and economic influence in her former African colonies.</p>
                        <p>Japan, whose technological capability in telecommunications is great and
                            growing, gives clear evidence of her desire to establish a regional
                            system which would include the Japanese islands, the Far East, and
                            probably Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0206"/>
                        <p>I believe it to be of the greatest importance that the incentives for the
                            establishment of regional systems be removed to the extent that it is
                            possible to do so, and that the United States redouble its efforts on
                            behalf of the single global satellite communication system.</p>
                        <p>If this is not done, and if the concept of regional systems is
                            successfully implemented by the French and the Japanese, they will
                            inevitably be followed by other nations capable of competing. The
                            ensuing proliferation of regional systems will destroy the concept
                            underlying the establishment of <gloss target="#t_COMSAT1"
                                >COMSAT</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss>
                            and ultimately destroy <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss>
                            itself.</p>
                        <p>The situation is confused, moreover, by the introduction of a number of
                            U.S. domestic issues which are now before the <gloss target="#t_FCC1"
                                >FCC</gloss> and will soon be considered by committees of Congress.
                            Action by the United States at this time to establish a separate
                            domestic system would, by our example, add much strength and support to
                            the French concepts of a European regional system outside of <gloss

                            needed the formulation of a national policy which will clarify the
                            position of the Executive Branch in respect to the global system and the
                            respective roles which <gloss target="#t_COMSAT1">COMSAT</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss> play in establishing
                            the global system. Such a statement of policy by the Executive Branch

                                definition at this time.” He added: “It also seems to me that there
                                is an inherent illogic in the draft [NSAM No. 338] in recognizing
                                that there are 'unique and vital national security needs which
                                cannot be met by commercial facilities' in so far as the U.S.
                                Government is concerned, but not recognizing that other countries
                                may feel that they also have 'unique and vital' needs, whether
                                security or otherwise, which cannot be met by a 'single global
                                system.'” (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59,

                        <p>For text of NSAM No. 338 (Revised), see <ref target="#d96">Document
                                96</ref>.</p>
                        <p>A number of intragovernmental panels have been engaged in addressing
                            these matters. The complexity of the problems and the infrequency of
                            panel meetings have caused the panel actions to move slowly and they
                            have not been keeping pace with the rapidly developing situations. As a
                            result, representatives of our respective offices have discussed ways
                            and means of expediting action on the most serious and fastest growing
                            problems. We are now working on an informal but increasingly expedited
                            basis with representatives of your Department.</p>
                        <p>I believe that our joint efforts can profitably be directed toward two
                            immediate objectives. It needs to be made clear to the nations of <gloss
                                target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss> that the seeming attraction
                            of regional systems is illusory, that there is nothing which a regional
                            system can do which the global <pb n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0207"
                            />system cannot do better and at less cost, that replacement of the idea
                            of a unified, integrated, and free association of nations in the <gloss
                                target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss> venture by a scheme to
                            partition the world into spheres of separate, competing systems will
                            bring with it all of the serious defects of our present international
                            communications structure.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, as a matter of urgency, there would appear to be great
                            value in instituting a series of talks with the European nations which
                            are currently considering entering into the proposed European regional
                            system.</p>
                        <p>I further believe that a most important objective in the interest of
                            getting <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss> more firmly
                            established is to achieve more rapid progress in establishing the
                            required earth station complex. Earth stations are the means by which
                            the global system can be completed. Far more significantly, however,
                            they are the means by which the voices of the poorer, underdeveloped
                            nations can be heard in the councils of <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1"
                                >INTELSAT</gloss>. This collective voice can be the strongest
                            counteracting influence upon those nations which seek to establish or
                            reestablish in this new field nationally polarized communications
                            hegemonies.</p>
                        <p>A variety of influences appears to be delaying decisions concerning the
                            establishment and financing of earth stations in developing countries,
                            particularly in South America. In the latter area, additional conflict
                            and confusion result from domestic and international interests of U.S.
                            common carriers.</p>
                        <p>The tide of events presses urgently for a policy which will permit
                            expeditious acquisition of earth stations by those countries which are
                            clearly interested but apparently unable to make headway in obtaining
                            them. In this respect, I recommend that the Department of State make
                            such representations to the Inter-American Development Bank as will
                            result in prompt action on loan requests from South American nations,
                            and that any indications which previously may have been made to these
                            nations of an unwillingness by the Inter-American Development Bank to
                            accept loan requests be rescinded.</p>
                        <p>I cannot overemphasize, Mr. Secretary, my concern with the need for
                            prompt and aggressive action in these matters. I want you to know that
                            the resources of my office are available to support and assist you in
                            all such actions that you may decide to take.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary has asked me to reply to your letter of February 21<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d95fn2">
                                <ref target="#d94">Document 94</ref>.</note> in which you outlined
                            your concerns on developments in the international telecommunications
                            field, particularly regarding the future of the commercial
                            communications satellite systems, <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1"
                                >INTELSAT</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>There are, as you note, some indications that certain members of <gloss
                                target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss> are restive and seem to be
                            pursuing a separate regional approach rather than the single global
                            system concept that is contemplated by the 1964 <gloss
                                target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss> Agreements. I believe that
                            the international cooperative effort of <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1"
                                >INTELSAT</gloss> has been an extraordinary success to date, and
                            hope that we can build on this success, rather than dismantle the basic
                                <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss> structure which was
                            designed to achieve the goals set forth in the Communications Satellite
                            Act of 1962 and the related policies expressed by Presidents Kennedy and
                                <persName>Johnson</persName>. This success of <gloss
                                target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss> leads me to believe that
                                <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss>'s future is not
                            perhaps so dark as might be assumed from a restive member such as
                            France.</p>
                        <p>I understand that you and representatives from this Bureau have been
                            working very closely together, and will continue to do so, in preparing
                            for the proposed renegotiations of the 1964 Agreements. In this regard I
                            would like to commend you for the efforts you are making to establish
                            for this Government a rational and coordinated policy concerning
                            communications by satellite.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the specific suggestions made in your letter, I agree that we
                            should press on in convincing our partners in <gloss
                                target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss> of the advantages of some
                            form of a single global system. It may be necessary and desirable to
                            accommodate within the single global concept establishment of domestic
                            communications satellite services. This effort involves a process of
                            continuous definition of this concept, and I see this as a central part
                            of the renegotiation of the 1964 Agreements. We have already had
                            preliminary discussions with the Canadians, the British, and the French
                            to ascertain their thinking, and similar talks <pb n="179"
                                xml:id="pg_179" facs="0209"/>will be instituted with other countries
                            as preparations for the 1969 conference proceed.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the establishment of earth stations, progress is being made
                            in certain less developed countries. Just how much this rate of progress
                            can be speeded up is hard to predict in light of the newness of this
                            mode of communications and the many other pressing problems these
                            countries have. As you know, <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> offered
                            last May to assist three African countries in the construction of earth
                            stations, but, even with this assistance assured, actual construction
                            has not commenced. With regard to your suggestion that we urge the
                            Inter-American Development Bank to take an active role on loans for the
                            establishment of earth stations in Latin America, as you know, we are
                            now in process of carefully reviewing the history of our policy with
                            regard to IDB lending for earth stations and the overall United States
                            interests involved.</p>
                        <p>I have also noted your February 17 Memorandum to the President<note n="3"

                            that this Department will continue to work closely with you in seeking
                            solutions to the many problems discussed therein.</p>
                        <p>Again, thanks for bringing to our attention the various issues
                            confronting us in the field of satellite communications. I am sure that
                            if we persevere we will be able to arrive at decisions which will be
                            fully responsive to the needs of the United States in the
                            telecommunications field and also be in the best interest of this
                            country.</p>

                                    space. One important use of space is the improvement of
                                    communications. In this regard, it is the policy of the United
                                    States to support and promote continuing development of a single
                                    global commercial communications satellite system. The United
                                    States Government is committed to the use of global commercial
                                    communications facilities for general governmental
                                    communications purposes wherever satellite circuits are required
                                    and commercial circuits of the type and quality needed to meet
                                    government requirements can be made available on a timely basis
                                    and in accordance with applicable tariff or, in the absence of
                                    Federal Communications Commission jurisdiction, at reasonable
                                    cost. Separate satellite communications facilities including
                                    surface terminals may be established and maintained by the

                        <p>Early in 1968 State Department officials began to prepare for the
                            February 1969 conference to negotiate permanent arrangements for
                            communications satellites. On January 9, 1968, U.K. Government officials
                            told Embassy officials that the European countries generally were
                            favorably inclined toward Intelsat, but that some conditions would
                            definitely require renegotiation and that France especially was inclined
                            not to agree: “FonOff representative made thinly veiled insinuation that
                            but for the French there would be a unanimous position and that this
                            position would closely parallel that of the U.S.” (Telegram 5328 from
                            London, January 9; National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59,
                            Records of the Department of State, Central Files, 1967–69, TEL 6)</p>
                        <p>The Embassy in Rome reported on March 15 that an Italian Foreign Ministry
                            source claimed that “the French are obsessed by American hegemony in
                                <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss>… . Their objection to
                            any move that would reduce the divergencies between the American and
                            European positions, he believes, based on French tactics: if the
                            American and European concepts are far enough apart, the French will be
                            able to pull out all the stops at the time of the formal negotiations
                            for the permanent <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss>
                            arrangements, and rely on nationalistic and crowd-pleasing arguments to
                            carry the day and disrupt the proceedings.” (Airgram A–928 from Rome,

                        <p>Since the President invited the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and

                            August, the Soviets—after a delay—have parried with vague
                            counterproposals of cooperation between <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1"
                                >INTELSAT</gloss> and MOLNIYA (the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"

                            auspices. Moscow has been countering such proposals in one way or
                            another since 1964 (when it rejected the first US invitation to
                            participate in <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss>), proposing

                            the Soviets now hint at, however, may well represent their first
                            preference, for cooperation combines the best of two Soviet worlds: use

                            facilities without the drawbacks of joining what the Soviets see as a

                            Cuba. In none of these cases, however, has there been confirmation of
                            follow-up action.</p>
                        <p>It seems doubtful that the Soviets ever seriously considered breaking out
                            of a regional framework and mounting a self-sufficient world hookup
                            competing across-the-board with <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1"
                                >INTELSAT</gloss>. To be sure, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> for a while went through motions consistent with such
                            a policy; while beefing up Molniya ground and space facilities, the
                            Soviets proceeded to exchange color-television transmissions with Paris
                            via MOLNIYA and last April got Eastern European regimes to sign a joint
                            communiqué endorsing international development of <pb n="189"
                                xml:id="pg_189" facs="0219"/>MOLNIYA. These motions, however, may
                            merely have been ploys designed to increase Soviet bargaining power in
                            future negotiations on a deal with <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1"
                                >INTELSAT</gloss>. The transmissions to and from Paris never passed
                            the experimental stage and were probably aimed mainly at dramatizing the
                            Paris-Moscow “dialogue” and advertising the French SECAM process. (Even
                            in the latter sphere, Franco-Soviet cooperation has so far been stunted;
                            mass production of color-television sets has been stymied by technical
                            difficulties, and marketing prospects are dimmed by Eastern European
                            malaise about SECAM's cost and incompatibility with Western

                            face of recent US invitations to join <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1"
                                >INTELSAT</gloss> is consistent with the initial Soviet posture when
                            the organization was formed in 1964. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> declined a US invitation on that occasion also,
                            suggesting that any international <gloss target="#t_COMSAT1"
                                >Comsat</gloss> system should come under UN control.</p>
                        <p>In the Soviet view, the main drawback to membership in <gloss
                                target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss> is probably that it would,
                            inter alia, amount to an official Soviet endorsement of an organization
                            that seems to be dominated by the US. (The formula for allocating voting
                            power among <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss> members—their
                            share of international communications traffic—gives the US about 53
                            percent of the vote.) The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has
                            consistently avoided such endorsements, as in the case of the Asian
                            Development Bank (where the US subscribes the majority of capital).
                            Vietnam of course makes the Soviets doubly wary of overt demonstrations
                            of direct cooperation with the US. Furthermore, <gloss
                                target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss> itself is currently
                            undergoing some ferment which, in the Soviet calculus, no doubt appears
                            promising and which might be discouraged by a sudden Soviet entry at
                            this time. Moscow has no doubt gotten wind of various French proposals
                            for either decreasing the US voting share or forming separate regional
                                <gloss target="#t_COMSAT1">Comsat</gloss> systems.</p>

                            international standing and earnings. The Soviets would also probably
                            obtain considerable leverage in international satellite-communications
                            affairs if cooperative arrangements gave MOLNIYA a regional monopoly and

                        <p>Soviet interest in <gloss target="#t_COMSAT1">Comsat</gloss> cooperation
                            has been demonstrated as well as referred to in recent statements. In
                            1967 the Soviets agreed to transmit two television shows to a global
                            audience in conjunction with <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1"
                                >INTELSAT</gloss>. Satellites of this organization were allowed to
                            relay live telecasts between Moscow and Tokyo on the occasion of the
                            inauguration of Japanese-Soviet air service last April. One MOLNIYA and
                            three <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss> satellites were also
                            scheduled to cooperate in a global television spectacular last June, but
                            this agreement was not carried out because of Soviet reaction to the
                            Middle East crisis; Moscow claimed that Western TV stations were
                            “conducting a smear campaign against Arab countries.”</p>

                            Western views on this question. Soviet statements to date have been
                            framed in low key and channeled through spokesmen of middling authority.
                            Future Soviet tactics and postures in the <gloss target="#t_COMSAT1"
                                >Comsat</gloss> game will doubtless be strongly affected by the

                            East-West “political climate”—as the 1969 renegotiation date approaches.
                            The main Soviet objectives, however, will probably remain fairly
                            constant: a Soviet monopoly on <gloss target="#t_COMSAT1">Comsat</gloss>

                            communications needs of the world can be satisfied by a highly
                            integrated network of high capacity satellites, and the French view that
                            provision must be made for system member countries to buy and own
                            circuits in their selected areas of world interest. The exposition of

                        <p>Although all these discussions were amicable, the French representatives
                            stated their views with a conviction and force which seemed to indicate
                            that there is presently little negotiating latitude in the French
                            position. Colino, acting as spokesman for the <gloss target="#t_COMSAT1"
                                >COMSAT</gloss> views, tried patiently to cite instances and areas
                            in which <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss> had either shown
                            flexibility or is moving in a direction to respond at least partially to
                            the French position. Where the French motivation was obviously political
                            such counter arguments fell on very barren ground.</p>
                        <p>The political ends which a French regional communications satellite
                            system must serve completely elude the cool, patient, statistical study
                            of the growth in world communications and its extension to probable
                            future needs. It seemed clear that the French do not see <gloss
                                target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss> as providing either the
                            political or the industrial “satisfactions they seek”—to use Voge's
                            words.</p>
                        <p>At this point in time when France fears television broadcasts directly
                            from satellites into her sphere of political interest with as much
                            passion as she yearns to beam broadcasting into that area from her own
                            satellites, she feels that she cannot afford too much objectivity in her
                            communication satellite policy. A global system in which France would of
                            necessity play not the smallest, but certainly a rather minor role,
                            especially in its sphere of major interest, does not respond to what the
                            French believe are their political needs. A regional system, on the
                            other hand, covering the French sphere of interest would probably permit
                            France to play the dominant role.</p>

                            returned to Glassboro, New Jersey, the site of his 1967 summit with
                            Soviet Chairman Kosygin. <persName>Johnson</persName> spoke of the

                                xml:id="pg_193" facs="0223"/>proposed additional fields in which the

                            One of his “new” proposals called for stepping up efforts to develop a
                            global communication satellite system. “The United States believes that
                            better communications are essential to mutual understanding between
                            nations,” he said. “We look forward to the day when the Soviet Union and
                            the nations of Eastern Europe will join the system.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_OHD1">Henry Owen</persName>, Director of the
                            Policy Planning Staff, commented on the proposal the next day: “it is
                            unrealistic to suppose that the Soviets would join an organization which
                            is subject to a U.S. veto and managed by a private U.S. corporation.”
                            The questions of vetoes and voting rights were sensitive ones: “If the
                            Soviets were not willing to settle for a respectable piece of the
                            action, then their participation would not be much of a bonus for
                            cooperation anyway.” Owen concluded: “In brief, we should try to show
                            the Soviets that they can't beat <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1"
                                >INTELSAT</gloss>, so they might as well join it.” (Memorandum from

                        <p>On July 19 the Department transmitted another proposal to the Soviets,
                            following it up with an offer of talks at the upcoming UN Outer Space
                            Conference in Vienna in August. (Airgram A–307 to Vienna, July 19;

                            for the Soviet Union to consider. He was unenthusiastic about the

                                which he chairs. Drawing on reftel and other messages, developed
                                reasons why we strongly support <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1"
                                    >INTELSAT</gloss> and why we would be much concerned if

                                    >INTELSAT</gloss> or otherwise. Waldheim said he understood and
                                could assure us Conference as such would not go along with any such
                                Soviet maneuvers although he could not, of course, predict what

                            <item>Referring to Soviet motivation, Waldheim said Soviets have been
                                opposed to <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss> from very
                                beginning (1) on doctrinal grounds since private enterprise
                                (capitalism) is heavily involved and (2) because if Soviets joined
                                they would have virtually no voice because Soviets have less than 5
                                percent of global communications traffic. Waldheim believes Soviets
                                [garble] making Intersputnik proposal as ploy (that French and some

                            <persName>Rostow</persName> remarked that the reports about the Soviet
                            space proposals were interesting. Why hadn't they been given to us?
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said they had been
                            made public, and <persName>Rostow</persName> referred to the fact that
                            they <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0228"/>had been handed to other

                            publicly announced. If the Soviets were serious about finding a
                            politically appropriate way to cooperate in the field of satellite
                            communications, <persName>Rostow</persName> said, we should be glad to
                            discuss the problem with them. They knew the President's policy in this
                            regard, to which he had referred again recently in Glassboro. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked whether the question
                            should be taken up in Vienna. <persName>Rostow</persName> said that Mr.

                            shortly, and would be glad to talk with the Soviet representative, but
                            the problem could also be examined here privately if they wished to do
                            so. As <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> knew,
                                <persName>Rostow</persName> had these matters on his plate.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Just before the Czech invasion, the Soviets, along with seven other
                            Communist countries, floated a proposal for the establishment of an
                            international communications system, which they dubbed Intersputnik. A
                            message from Premier Kosygin announcing the proposal was read at the
                            opening session of the Vienna UN Space Conference, August 14. He said
                            that ”… in order to satisfy the needs of the developed and
                            underdeveloped countries, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is
                            proposing the creation of an international communications system through
                            artificial earth satellites based on democratic principles with total
                            equality of all its participants”.</p>
                        <p>The draft agreement is structurally similar in content to the present
                                <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss> agreement. A major
                            difference is the provision for decision making on a
                            one-country/one-vote basis rather than weighted voting based on
                            investment as in the <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss>
                            system.</p>
                        <p>At present we can only speculate as to the Soviet motives in putting
                            forth this proposal at this time. We doubt that they seriously expect to
                            establish a truly world-wide system to supplant <gloss
                                target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss>. It could be that they
                            envision a more limited one which would handle some of the traffic among
                            the Soviet Union and its allies. A number of countries, principally for
                            political reasons, may want to participate in such a system as well as
                            in <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss>. Alternatively, the
                            Soviets' real aim may be to force a restructuring of <gloss
                                target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss> in the forthcoming
                            negotiations on <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss> permanent
                            arrangements, so that they can participate on a basis of equality with
                            the United States. Lastly, they may simply be interested in making these
                            negotiations more difficult for the United States. They have not
                            exhibited any interest in <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss>
                            to date. You may recall that since the spring of 1964 we have at various
                            times encouraged the Soviets to join <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1"
                                >INTELSAT</gloss>, the last time being your speech in June
                            commemorating the Glassboro talks.</p>
                        <p>It is worth noting that both Yugoslavia and Romania are showing interest
                            in joining <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss>, and, in fact,
                            the Communications Satellite <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0230"

                        <p>Jim Webb has reported from Vienna that the Soviets did not gain the
                            propaganda splash they must have intended, and that the United States
                            presentations have been most impressive. While the Soviets have not
                            succeeded in disrupting the agreed agenda of the Conference, they may
                            have set the stage for continuing agitation on this issue.<note n="2"

                                particularly important in light of East German aggression against

                            communist countries, especially Communist China and East Germany, there
                            will be considerable Congressional reaction.<note n="5" xml:id="d108fn5"

                        <p>As preparatory negotiations continued for the February 1969 <gloss
                                target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss> conference, the Soviet Union
                            maintained that it would not join an organization in which usage
                            determined voting rights and control. As reported by the Embassy in
                            Stockholm on October 11, Sweden was planning to raise the issue in the
                            UN Space Committee because Swedish officials “seem prepared to assume
                            that conference will fail.” The Swedes believed that the Soviets and
                            their East European allies would find a conference under UN auspices
                            “useful and more attractive.” (Telegram 3171 from Stockholm, October 11,
                            1968; National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Records of
                            the Department of State, Central Files, 1967–69, TEL 6)</p>
                        <p>On October 15 the Department replied: “While we agree that the Soviet
                            Intersputnik proposal cannot simply be ignored, we believe it is
                            important to maintain proper perspective with respect to it. <gloss
                                target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss> is going concern with 63
                            members in most parts of the globe and with effective and important
                            international communications in being. It is also an operating
                            commercial enterprise representing major investments. Intersputnik on
                            the other hand is only a proposal, and its only known support is
                            regional, not global.” The Department believed that the Swedish proposal
                            would be counterproductive since it would not prevent the establishment
                            of an independent Soviet satellite system and would seriously undercut
                            U.S. efforts to obtain Soviet participation in <gloss

                        <p>In November the United Kingdom launched a strong effort to rally
                            opposition in Europe and dissuade Sweden from approaching the United
                            Nations. (Telegram 27302 from London, November 16; ibid.) U.K. officials
                            found that Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, and Germany opposed the
                            Swedish initiative, Norway was equivocal, and France was sympathetic.
                            (Telegram 280799 to London, December 3; ibid.)</p>
                        <p>The Department urged the U.S. Mission to the United Nations to explain
                            the problem to its Swedish counterpart: “The Soviets have not responded
                            to our past invitation to discuss membership in <gloss
                                target="#t_INTELSAT1">INTELSAT</gloss>, and we simply do not know
                            whether U.S.S.R. is sincerely interested in joining organization or what
                            changes, if any, would make <gloss target="#t_INTELSAT1"
                                >INTELSAT</gloss> politically acceptable to it. If Sweden believes
                            itself in a position to explore this matter with U.S.S.R. prior to
                            conference establishing definitive arrangements, its assistance would be
                            most welcome.” Swedish representatives privately informed USUN officials
                            on December 18 that they would “make no further move re <gloss

                        <p>General Quesada visited me this morning and told me that the French
                            Ambassador had discussed the French SST program with him on December 5.
                            He said the Ambassador went out of his way to bring up the SST program.
                            The Ambassador said he was going to discuss the SST when he returned to
                            France and made the following points.</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>The French were disturbed about the actions of the British. If the
                                British pulled out, he doubted that the French would
                                continue.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>He pursued a reorientation of the program as a tripartite program,
                                mentioned that the current “race” atmosphere was most unfortunate,
                                said he was interested in retrieving the French position, and asked
                                about our attitude towards a three-way deal.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>He asked whether America was bound to the Mach 3 regime. He
                                favored the prolonging of the program, and was disturbed by the
                                increased costs.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>He believed that the U.S. should raise any tripartite interest
                                directly with the French rather than through the British, or rather
                                than have the French come to the U.S. for help. He suggested that if
                                the U.S. raised the SST problem with the French, it might help to
                                heal some of the wounds that have come up from time to time.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>He indicated that he was anxious to see General Quesada again and
                                pursue their conversation before he returned to France next
                                week.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>General Quesada also told me he would like to make clear why he started
                            the SST program. He said that he started the program as a result of the
                            B–70 program and he was not advocating an SST but rather exploiting the
                            know-how of the B–70 program and attempting to avoid duplicating
                            programs. He said that he never conceived of the SST program being
                            pushed the way it now is and never thought in terms of the government
                            picking up 90% of the cost on the program. At <pb n="211"
                                xml:id="pg_211" facs="0241"/>best, he thought the SST development
                            might follow a successful B–70 development by five or so years.</p>
                        <p>I thanked General Quesada for his views and told him I would inform
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> of them.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Significant points of conversation with Minister were:</p>
                        <p>British have decided continue original Concorde program. As nothing on
                            engineering or production side of program has been changed since
                            election, despite political furor, <persName corresp="#p_JR3"
                                >Jenkins</persName> feels that Concorde lead still substantial. He
                            would like Administrator <persName corresp="#p_HN2">Halaby</persName> to
                                <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0242"/>discuss possibility of
                            agreement on rate of progress both projects during visit February 15th.
                            Discussions would include Minister Jacquet and could be held either
                            London or Paris. In suggesting London, he had not known of <persName
                                corresp="#p_HN2">Halaby</persName> intention of visiting Paris
                            February 11th, 12th. (<persName corresp="#p_JR3">Jenkins</persName> saw
                            Jacquet secretly in France January 11; only January 17 Observer carried
                            news.)</p>
                        <p>Prill told Minister that he believed Administrator would be willing to
                            discuss subject but that this obviously difficult question for U.S. and
                            that he certain Administrator would wish to discuss with other officials
                            and possibly President before and after meeting British/French. In
                            answer to Prill's question Minister stated that he believed initial
                            agreement should be between governments but that he would have no
                            objection to Boeing or Lockheed making either technical or sales
                            agreements with <gloss target="#t_BAC1">BAC</gloss> and SUD. Prill
                            explained normal American competitive practice as affects delivery dates
                            and delivery position and pointed out that the present Concorde/U.S. SST
                            sales relationship followed this pattern, with U.S. airlines leading
                            scramble to be first on both delivery lists. Minister indicated he
                            understood this but felt agreements to delay production of both aircraft
                            until more experience available with sonic boom and proof of prototypes
                            would help both aircraft.</p>
                        <p>Minister confirmed that decision to build only prototypes was worst of
                            both worlds and that they did not intend to follow this course. Minister
                            also made it clear that desire to reach agreement with U.S. on rate of
                            progress was not based upon hope that this would give British another
                            chance to cancel but rather a sincere concern about wisdom of committing
                            money for tooling so long before prototype flight.</p>
                        <p>Minister candidly admitted that initial decision by Labor government to
                            cancel project had been changed by strong French political pressure
                            coupled with obvious French conviction that airplane economically
                            viable. Minister admits there are still many doubters on economic
                            acceptability of airplane. As in U.S., economics and sonic boom are two
                            biggest concerns.</p>
                        <p>Minister related economic capability to five million pounds selling
                            price. He used this figure in a way that indicated at least tentative
                            agreement had been given to this price, recognizing that it would not
                            cover research and development costs, which governments would not expect
                            to recover.</p>
                        <p>No decision taken yet on TSR–2 which, if cancelled, would certainly
                            affect development of Olympus engine.</p>
                        <p>In summary, Embassy believes that if Administrator <persName
                                corresp="#p_HN2">Halaby</persName> willing, he should be prepared to

                            <persName corresp="#p_JR3">Jenkins</persName> proposal for talks
                            presents two issues for decision by US. First we must decide almost
                            immediately whether to enter into tripartite talks at all on program
                            stabilization. Two views on this point evident—if we can immediately
                            conclude that US has no interest in agreement of this type, it might be
                            better not to enter into discussions which could lead only to failure
                            and frustration. On other hand it would be discourteous and perhaps even
                            more dangerous to assert we will not even talk. US could then be used by
                            UKG as whipping boy in defending accelerated Concorde program to British
                            public. UKG could use similar argument in event failure of talks but
                            impact would be less, particularly if US has well-reasoned position.</p>
                        <p>Second decision <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> must ultimately make
                            is long term. Is it in US interest to stabilize respective SST programs
                            so that each side knows where it stands or is US better off maintaining
                            independence and flexibility? US Govt is now subject more pressures for
                            slowdown in Concorde program than either French or US Govts. Key here is
                            whether British, once over temporary economic and financial
                            embarrassment, <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214" facs="0244"/>would be forced
                            forge ahead as fast as possible on Concorde, given presumed French
                            position, if faced with dynamic and unpredictable US SST effort.</p>
                        <p>On strictly competitive considerations, if we conclude that Concorde is
                            faced with unavoidable slowdown due British political and economic
                            realities, might be to US advantage to maintain free hand to adjust US
                            SST program as we see fit. On other hand if we conclude that Concorde
                            timetable inevitably linked with our own (and vice versa) despite
                            temporary <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> problems, might be to mutual
                            advantage to stabilize situation by entering into schedule
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>Aside from competitive considerations, value of stabilizing agreement to
                            US appears primarily related to extent and importance of unknown factors
                            in US program such as sonic boom and economics. If these problems
                            resolved or can be expected to be resolved in good time, then difficult
                            perceive over-riding considerations favoring US acceptance of commitment
                            on timetable which might inhibit production and delivery viable US SST.
                            If determination satisfactory solution these problems still some time
                            away or unpredictable, then rational approach would seem call for some
                            form agreed schedule on both sides. In any event presume that US, if it
                            decides to enter into discussions leading eventually to a schedule
                            agreement, would not accept any arrangement which would increase time
                            gap contemplated by respective original programs.</p>

                            available as we see them, and we have at this time not made

                            proposal. Embassy views on proposal are along following lines:</p>
                        <p>Believe question SST cooperation must be regarded in wider context than
                            simply aviation. Events of last few months have more than ever involved
                            entire <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Government including <gloss
                                target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> in SST problem. Assume French Government
                            involvement similar. Result is that reasonable degree of success on
                            Concorde program must be considered important national objective.
                            Failure to achieve this objective, particularly when cause can be
                            ascribed to US intransigence, may well have adverse effect on major US
                            aims vis-à-vis <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France.</p>
                        <p>For these reasons Embassy believes in over-all US interest to enter into
                            discussions with British and French and reach at least timetable
                            agreement on development respective SSTs. See no particular reason,
                            however, why necessary reach agreement on aircraft characteristics,
                            sales agreements, and industry cooperation (items 2–4 in Embtel 3350) if
                            not sensible from aviation viewpoint.</p>
                        <p>Even on aviation grounds there appears to be some merit in stabilizing
                            respective timetables. Current official target date for Concorde is
                            1971. Embassy estimates more realistic date for original program is
                            1972. Without outside competitive pressures consider likely Anglo-French
                            re-examination of details and attempt develop more efficient program
                            would delay completion of program by 1 to 2 years, i.e. to 1973 or 74.
                            On other hand, given US program which <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_Fr1">Fr</gloss> might reckon would
                            endanger early lead, governments would attempt keep Concorde as close to
                            original timetable as possible. Embassy doubts that current British
                            efforts to reduce near term commitments would stand in the way of
                            accelerated activity on Concorde if <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>/Fr
                            saw time lead slipping away.</p>
                        <p>Washington, of course, in better position evaluate completion date US SST
                            program. All estimates Embassy has seen indicate US SST might be 2–4
                            years later than Concorde, i.e. 1973–75. Understand anticipated
                            substantial advantages US SST over Concorde such that lag not expected
                            affect materially prospects of US project. However, there seems <pb
                                n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0246"/>to be general consensus in US
                            that US should not proceed with production until basic economic and
                            technical problems resolved.</p>
                        <p>Thus, it appears to Embassy that US has much to gain and little to lose
                            by entering into stabilizing agreement. First, we would be in a position
                            to develop and complete a sensible program with adequate time to resolve
                            current difficult problems without looking over our shoulder at the
                            competition. Second, an acceptable time lag position would be assured
                            for the US thus permitting ultimate exploration superior performance of
                            US aircraft. Third, a sensible <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> program
                            will permit more effective use of that nation's limited resources, and
                            thus strengthen its role as an important US ally. Embassy notes that
                                <persName corresp="#p_HN2">Halaby</persName> will have only one day
                            with <persName corresp="#p_JR3">Jenkins</persName> during forthcoming

                                >MOA</gloss> meetings. While this would presumably allow only
                            conceptual exploration of possible agreement, see no reason why details
                            could not be worked out in <gloss target="#t_FAUSST1">FAUSST</gloss>

                            <persName corresp="#p_HN2">Halaby</persName> emphasized govt interest in
                            safety, operational and economic requirements. He was pleased to learn

                            environmental tests. Three unknowns in this area inter alia: (1) Public
                            acceptability sonic boom, (2) noise at airports, and (3) atmospheric
                            temperature conditions. US has been studying SST for 8 years at cost of
                            $110 million. In addition safety and environmental factors, US has been
                            working at economics proposed SST operation in light of current and
                            projected subsonic developments. US program still not established
                            although President expected make decision in next 90 days to do one of
                            following: Terminate, study further, or construct prototype. <gloss

                            industry had made preliminary estimates that, subject to early decision,
                            prototype could be built by 1968, certification in 1972, with service
                            inauguration some time later. Characteristics US SST—gross weight
                            500,000 lbs., L:D ratio 8.9, approximate transonic over-pressure 2 lbs.,
                            cruise over-pressure 1.5 lbs., cruising altitude 55 to 75 thousand feet,
                            Mach 2.6 to 3, capacity 200 to 250, and operating cost equal current
                            jets. Material would be titanium and new engine would be required.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_JR3">Jenkins</persName> noted vast expense SST
                            projects and big govt investment. This demanded govt responsibility
                            ensure economic program. Although in past <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss>/France had hoped collaboration with US possible, now
                            appeared evident joint development and construction not practical.
                            Nevertheless he felt useful maintain contact on respective schedules. At
                            moment he had no precise proposals but was expressing only general
                            ideas.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_HN2">Halaby</persName> agreed not feasible at
                            present reconsider joint construction; this question really determined
                            by <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>/French decision to proceed with
                            Concorde. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> position had always been
                            that respective companies <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219" facs="0249"/>could
                            discuss and work out any arrangements not inconsistent with respective
                            statutes. In fact manufacturers had consulted earlier but could not
                            agree on basic concepts. US did not consider situation involved
                            competitive race but attempt to cooperate on safety and economics. He
                            estimated total investment, operation and maintenance cost of SST
                            program worldwide would be 75 to 100 billion dollars by 1990. Impossible
                            to exaggerate importance of sonic boom acceptability which could easily
                            spell difference between profit and loss. Agreed useful to keep in touch
                            on time scale but could not tie US time schedule to Concorde as limited
                            US design on this account. He would be willing consult <gloss

                            largely theoretical. What was needed were practical sonic boom tests to

                            on continent. Heretofore aircraft have been built first and

                            terminate it was desirable to pursue environmental studies.</p>

                                previously reported by Embassy, this theme has been: 'Let us agree

                        <p>The second meeting of the <gloss target="#t_FAUSST1">FAUSST</gloss>
                            group, held in Washington February 1–5, 1965, discussed air frames,
                            atmosphere, and the sonic boom. In a report dated June 10, an economic
                            officer observed: “I attended part of one session on the SST. The <gloss
                                target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss> summarized some of the results of the
                            Oklahoma City and White Sands sonic boom tests. The data on community
                            reaction in Oklahoma City is now being analyzed by the National Academy
                            of Science. A report will be prepared on the community reaction. From
                            casual observation, the <gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss> felt that
                            there had not been any significant reaction to the booms by the populace
                            of Oklahoma City and <gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss> did not know of
                            any physiological damage.” (Memorandum for the files by Mary Irene Pett,

                        <p>On May 7 the Federal Aviation Agency released its reports on the sonic
                            boom studies. It noted that “over 80 per cent of those questioned, when
                            informed of the SST plans of the British, French and Russians, expressed
                            the opinion to opinion researchers that the U.S. should proceed with
                            developing an SST.” Nonetheless, “Substantial numbers of residents
                            reported interference with ordinary living activities and annoyance with
                            such interruptions, but the overwhelming majority felt they could learn
                            to live with the numbers and kinds of booms experienced during the six
                            month study.” However, the report continued, “the acceptance of the
                            booms fell from about 90 per cent of those residents of Oklahoma City
                            interviewed during the first weeks of the program to about 75 per cent
                            of a comparable sample of the population during the final weeks.”

                            commented on fully when report published. Of significance at moment,
                            however, are indications we have received that Plowden Report appears be
                            based to great extent on untested assumptions, loose general analysis
                            and inadequate statistical base. Report will lack rigorous analysis and
                            economic-military back up data which should be essential in major report
                            of this kind.</p>
                        <p>Final review of draft report by Plowden Committee now going on. Embassy
                            understands there may be minority of Plowden Committee which does not
                            support conclusions of majority and which may, therefore, release
                            minority report which may call for cooperation with US as well as
                            continent. Embassy believes that in this final review serious weakness
                            in Plowden Report due to lack of sound analytical base may be called to
                            attention of the committee by the minority. Believe minority hand in
                            review would be strengthened by having example of sort of analysis in
                            depth typified by recent <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> economic

                            project, its use in context of Plowden Report would be primarily to

                                target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss> was in this regard concerned solely
                            with safety and was worried about certain features of the Concorde such
                            as cockpit visibility and design.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss> group further explained that on
                            the basis of the information it had available it probably would not be
                            able to issue an airworthiness (Type) certificate for the Concorde
                            unless some substantial changes were made on the aircraft. The refusal
                            of the US to certificate the Concorde would not represent a violation of
                            the US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> bilateral airworthiness air
                            agreement, for the agreement accorded wide latitude to the parties in
                            the certification of each other's civil aircraft. Furthermore, should
                            the United Kingdom and France certificate the plane, the United States
                            would not stop it from being operated by foreign air carriers to and
                            from the United States. The refusal of the <gloss target="#t_FAA1"
                                >FAA</gloss> to grant a United States certificate would only affect
                            use of the Concorde by US carriers. However, in view of the probable
                            limited world market for the Concorde (only 50 have been ordered on
                            option, 21 by US carriers) a refusal by the US to issue an airworthiness
                            certificate could very well cripple the Concorde program.</p>
                        <p>The Anglo-French SST people are generally aware of the areas where the
                                <gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss> is having problems regarding the
                            Concorde. They know this from the two tripartite technical SST meetings
                            which have been held. (These tripartite meetings are referred to as
                                <gloss target="#t_FAUSST1">FAUSST</gloss> meetings; “<gloss
                                target="#t_FAUSST1">FAUSST</gloss>” stands for French-Anglo-US
                            meeting on SST airworthiness standards.) Moreover, the <gloss
                                target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss> has already issued two SST
                            airworthiness standards publications: the “Red Book” of 1961, and the
                            “Blue Book” of 1963. By early November, the <gloss target="#t_FAA1"
                                >FAA</gloss> expects to issue its latest version which would be
                            called the “White Book.” It is <gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss>'s
                            intention to send copies of the “White Book” to the British and
                            French.</p>
                        <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0254"/>
                        <p>Also, in November, the <gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss> team
                            responsible for certification is to tour <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> and French SST facilities, after which the <gloss
                                target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss> should have a better understanding of
                            Concorde characteristics which might make United States certification
                            difficult. The <gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss> is to meet with the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France at <gloss
                                target="#t_FAUSST1">FAUSST</gloss> meetings in December 1965 and
                            February 1966, and an Anglo-French team will be coming to the US in
                            March to submit an application to the <gloss target="#t_FAA1"
                                >FAA</gloss> for a preliminary type certificate. It is <gloss
                                target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss>'s thinking that sometime after the
                            February 1966 <gloss target="#t_FAUSST1">FAUSST</gloss> meeting, the
                                <gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss> should officially inform the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France of our reservations,
                            perhaps by means of a letter from <persName>George S. Moore</persName>
                                (<gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss>) to his <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> and French counterparts.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LFE1">Loy</persName> requested that, after the
                                <gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss> team returns from Europe in
                            November, the <gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss> inform us promptly of
                            its views so we can determine how this matter should be brought to the
                            attention of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France. Any
                            airworthiness standards set by the <gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss>
                            which would restrict use of the Concorde by US airlines would be bound
                            to have undesirable political effects. It is imperative, therefore, that
                            we officially inform the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France at
                            the earliest feasible moment of any difficulties foreseen by the <gloss
                                target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_FAA1"

                            informal discussions with both the French and British, who originated

                        </p>
                        <p>Both French and British representatives indicated that while they favor
                            inclusion of the Russians, at least to a limited degree, they have not
                            discussed the proposal with the Soviets and have no idea of Russian
                            reaction.</p>
                        <p>We know relatively little about <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            development in the SST field, and it is possible that if the Soviets
                            participated objectively, we might not only learn something of their
                            development, but they might also contribute something of value to the
                            mutual effort. If it is eventually agreed that the Soviets are to be
                            invited to participate in the meetings, it will, of course, have to be
                            under controlled conditions. They should be active participants and not
                            just observers as they presently are at various <gloss target="#t_ICAO1"

                            Inasmuch as the proposal presented by the French and British raises
                            policy issues beyond the authority of this Agency to decide, we would

                            Aviation), expressed interest in a tripartite agreement among the
                                US-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-France to delay the
                            introduction of the Concorde and the US SST. Mr.
                                <persName>Vergnaud</persName> said, however, that in view of the
                            rebuff from the U.S. of February 1965, the ball was in the US court to
                            take any initiative. Dr. Enke suggested to Mr.
                                <persName>Vergnaud</persName> that he might wish to raise the
                            subject with the two private members of the President's SST Advisory
                            Committee, <persName corresp="#p_BER2">Eugene R. Black</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_OSJ1">Stanley de J. Osborne</persName>, when
                            they pass through Paris in the near future.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Enke added that the French also continued to be interested in a
                            share-the-market agreement whereby the Concorde would be developed to
                            serve shorter distances than the US SST.</p>
                        <p>In London, Dr. Enke held discussions with various <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> Ministry of Aviation and Treasury officials. It was
                            clear to him from these talks that some British officials were unhappy
                            about the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> being associated with the
                            Concorde. They believed that <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            participation was a basically political decision to facilitate future
                            British entry into the EEC. To withdraw from the project might result in
                            about a $500 million indemnity to France. Mr.
                                <persName>Schaetzel</persName> said he was skeptical that <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> participation in the Concorde project was
                            political. He suspected that the project appeals to <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and aircraft manufacturers who fear
                            further contraction of the British aviation industry.</p>
                        <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0257"/>
                        <p>Dr. <persName>Enke</persName> stated that the British appeared also to be
                            quite interested in a tripartite extension agreement but said, like Mr.
                                <persName>Vergnaud</persName>, that any initiative would have to
                            come from the US in view of the decision of February 1965. Dr.
                                <persName>Enke</persName> believed that the British would be pleased
                            to stretch out the Concorde program to lessen the annual financial
                            commitment for <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss> funds and to gain
                            time to produce a better aircraft. Dr. <persName>Enke</persName>
                            suggested to the British that if they were interested in a tripartite
                            agreement, they raise the question privately with Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BER2">Black</persName> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_OSJ1">Osborne</persName> during their visits to
                            London.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName>Enke</persName> said that his interest in seeing a
                            tripartite agreement concluded was based on his conviction that a better
                            US SST and a better Concorde would be built if several more years were
                            allowed for their development. He felt that the schedules of the SST
                            development programs on both sides of the Atlantic were much too fast to
                            produce economical aircraft.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Schaetzel</persName> asked if Dr. <persName>Enke</persName>
                            could prepare and send the Department an economic study and
                            justification for a tripartite agreement.<note n="3" xml:id="d124fn3"
                                >Not found.</note> Dr. <persName>Enke</persName> said he would do
                            so. Mr. <persName>Schaetzel</persName> said that when it was received,
                            the Department would study it and let him know its views.</p>

                            SST program and to obtain <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0258"/>the

                                US-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-France agreement to delay
                            commercial introduction of the Concorde and the US SST.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d125fn2">See <ref target="#d124">Document 124</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>For purposes of perspective, General Maxwell said that the Concorde was
                            expected to make its first prototype flight in 1968 and to be in
                            commercial operation in 1971. The first flight of the US SST prototype
                            was expected to take place in 1970 with commercial deliveries in 1974 at
                            the earliest. There was a good possibility, however, that the US SST
                            would not be ready for commercial service until 1976 or thereabouts.</p>
                        <p>General Maxwell added that a unique feature of the US SST development
                            schedule was the overlapping of the prototype, certification, and
                            production phases. This is not the normal way civil aircraft are built.
                            All three phases would overlap in 1970, and the certification and
                            production phases would continue to overlap for three and a half more
                            years. This overlapping of phases, with the many retoolings that will be
                            required, promises to be very expensive. The full 4-year certification
                            and production stage will cost $1 to $2 billion, bringing the total bill
                            for the US SST (together with <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss>
                            costs) to $3 to $4 billion. This overlapping of phases is a consequence
                            of a decision of the President's Advisory Committee which calls for: go
                            slow now; accelerate later.</p>
                        <p>Elimination of this overlapping of phases would result in an extension of
                            the time necessary to develop a US SST. This would suggest that the
                                <gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss> was in favor of Dr.
                                <persName>Enke</persName>'s proposal for a tripartite agreement. On
                            the contrary, the <gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss> was against it.
                            The idea of a tripartite agreement was raised and discussed last fall
                            during a meeting of the President's Advisory Committee and was not
                            adopted. It was discussed again most recently, a few days ago, between
                                <gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss> Administrator General <persName
                                corresp="#p_MKWE1">McKee</persName> and Secretary of Defense
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. Both agreed the
                            proposal should not be pursued.</p>
                        <p>General Maxwell said that the <gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss> was
                            opposed to an agreement for several reasons. First, the <gloss
                                target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss> did not believe that the US was in a
                            good bargaining position or could ever get the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> and France to delay introducing the Concorde. The
                            builders of the Concorde were well aware of the time advantage they
                            enjoyed over the US SST and may be cognizant that the 3-year lead time
                            they now have could stretch to 5 years. They would be foolish to delay
                            introducing their plane.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, even if negotiations could be concluded successfully to delay
                            introduction of the Concorde, <gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss> would
                            oppose this for fear of the adverse appropriations effect this would
                            have on Congress. <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0259"/>Congress
                            would be sure to learn of any attempt to delay introduction of the
                            Concorde and US SST and would probably react by cutting <gloss
                                target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss>'s annual requests for SST development
                            funds. Any cut this year and for the next few years, when we are already
                            in a slow stage, would be particularly unfortunate. In any case, it is
                            hard to believe Congress would not try to stretch out its
                            appropriations, with the effect that at the end of the extended period,
                            the US SST would not be any more ready for service than under the
                            present plan. It is thus doubtful that a more efficient US SST would end
                            up being built by negotiating a stretch-out agreement.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, this year, 1966, is not the most advantageous time to negotiate
                            with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France. If we were to
                            decide to negotiate, it would best be done in 1968. At that time, the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France will be faced with the
                            decision of moving into their expensive production phase costing $1
                            billion or more. Similarly, the US would be at the point of requesting
                            large appropriations for the first year of the overlapping phases
                            mentioned above. Both sides and the three national legislatures involved
                            would be faced with the need for very large sums and thus might be more
                            amenable to some stretch-out agreement.</p>

                        <p>At our meeting on March 14 concerning the US-Brazil negotiations,<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d128fn2">The United States and Brazil were negotiating
                                a bilateral air transport agreement, February 15–March 18; the
                                agreement was concluded in July 1968.</note> the Board invited the
                            Department's comments on a proposal to undertake a study on the probable
                            impact of the 747 and SST aircraft on our international aviation
                                relations.<note n="3" xml:id="d128fn3">Not found; historians at the
                                    <gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss> speculate that the study was
                                never undertaken.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Department believes that such a study is indeed needed. We have, in
                            fact, felt for some time that it would be desirable to look in depth
                            into the question of the impact of aviation technological advances on
                            U.S. international air transport policy and we had already given some
                            preliminary thought to the question. It has been evident that, while
                            much work has been done on the technical and economic characteristics of
                            the 747 and SST, little or no study has been directed toward the effect
                            which the introduction of these aircraft will have on the whole range of
                            our international aviation policy. We should have a clear idea of what
                            the impact will be, not only to plan for resolution of any problems when
                            these advanced aircraft are introduced, but also to respond to foreign
                            pressures for advance assurances of one sort or another, such as in the
                            Brazilian situation.</p>
                        <p>We believe that the General Counsel's memorandum of March 7,<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d128fn4">Not found.</note> which was made available to us,
                            provides a general outline of the scope and purpose of such a study. We
                            offer the following comments either in amplification of or in addition
                            to that memorandum: <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0262"/>
                            <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>We agree that attention should be directed toward an appraisal
                                    of the introduction of jet aircraft in the late 1950's and 60's.
                                    For example, it would be instructive to review the expectations
                                    which then existed and whether these expectations proved to be
                                    correct or not. Identification of the problems that arose and
                                    their causes would be desirable, as well as a review of how
                                    these problems were resolved. While there may be differences
                                    between this situation and the situation with respect to the
                                    introduction of the 747 and SST, some valuable lessons might be
                                    learned.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Although the question is most simply put in terms of 747 and
                                    SST, we suggest that the study focus attention also on the
                                    stretched versions of current aircraft. Also, it may be
                                    necessary to differentiate among these various categories, since
                                    it does not necessarily follow that the situations with respect
                                    to the stretched aircraft, the 747, and the SST will be the
                                    same. In fact, there may be significant differences among these
                                    situations.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>The possibility of arrangements (such as financing, leasing,
                                    or cooperative arrangements) for foreign carrier use of these
                                    aircraft certainly deserves close attention, since this may be a
                                    means of resolving the foreign competitive impact
                                    problem.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>The fare question also is crucial. Perhaps a case can be made
                                    that, since the 747 is expected to have a lower cost per seat
                                    mile than present aircraft, there should be a discount on the
                                    fares. On the other hand, there may be pressures for a fare
                                    surcharge to reduce the competitive impact. Perhaps advance
                                    planning can avoid the prospect of having to decide between
                                    basically irreconcilable alternatives.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>The impact of the new aircraft on capacity is perhaps the most
                                    critical question for U.S. air transport negotiations. We need
                                    to know, first of all, when and where the new aircraft will be
                                    used and the extent to which these services will replace
                                    existing services. The impact in these particular markets at the
                                    indicated times will then have to be determined, based on
                                    several sets of assumptions on the state of the market at the
                                    time.</item>

                        <p>The Department welcomes the proposal that the Board undertake this study.
                            In view of our very close interest in the subject, we would like to have
                            the opportunity of participating in review of the study at appropriate

                        <p rend="flushleft">Dear Frank:</p>
                        <p>I think we will need some fairly intensive consultations (including
                            consultations with you), and plenty of careful thought before definitive
                            conclusions can be reached on the points raised in your March 15
                                letter<note n="2" xml:id="d129fn2">These points included: “From
                                various sources of late, we understand that the Concorde engines may
                                or will be very noisy. If so, we could have some rather severe
                                problems at the United States airports where these planes will be
                                operated.” (Ibid.)</note> concerning the Concorde noise question. We
                            are also well aware here in DOT that the question and its many
                            ramifications have to be brought in hand soon.</p>
                        <p>Our preliminary information (confirming your understanding) is that the
                            Concorde will be very noisy, reaching levels significantly beyond those
                            we contemplate as standards of tolerance for noise control purposes.
                            Unfortunately, we will not have a fully adequate basis for decisions
                            until we obtain the noise level measurements to be made in connection
                            with the Concorde flight tests. There is no substitute for such data in
                            assessing how the Concorde will really sound in various stages of
                            take-off or landing, and in different modes of operation. We expect to
                            have such information shortly after the forthcoming tests, and our
                            technical authorities here have every confidence (given past experience
                            with their French and British counterparts) that the data will be
                            timely, reliable, and complete. Data should also be available during the
                            early phases of flight testing to permit considering the related and
                            equally if not more difficult question of the sonic boom.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, it is obvious that the noise/sonic boom question, coming ripe
                            with the approach of an operational Concorde, is a web of technical,
                            legal, social, economic, and political issues. It is being undertaken
                            here in DOT to put these many aspects into some coherent form, because
                            that kind of understanding will be essential for any decision about the
                            admissibility of aircraft; the conditions (such as speeds, times,
                            routings, or operational modes) to be applied to their flights; and the
                            distribution of responsibility (e.g., as between the DOT and local
                            airport authorities) for various parts of our solutions. We recognize
                            that the overall problem also contains important international factors,
                            and that <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0264"/>these must be taken
                            into account. I look forward to discussing these aspects with you very
                            soon. I think it might also be worthwhile if you would indicate a
                            point-of-contact in your office with whom we might be in touch as the
                            DOT work on this problem proceeds.</p>

                        <p>In 1963 the Kennedy administration began negotiations on a proposal for
                            the peaceful use of nuclear energy to fuel desalination plants in
                            regions lacking fresh drinking water. Under the aegis of the
                            International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United States and 10
                            other nations, including Israel and Tunisia, met twice to discuss the
                            proposal. (Circular telegram 1474, February 11, 1964; National Archives

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> signaled his
                            strong interest in the project and his belief that science would play an
                            increasingly central role in international affairs on February 6, 1964,
                            in a speech delivered at the 18th annual dinner of the Weizmann
                            Institute of Science in New York. The President announced that the
                            United States and Israel had begun negotiations “on cooperative research
                            in using nuclear energy to turn salt water into fresh water.” He
                            acknowledged the technical difficulties inherent in the problem, but
                            noted that “the opportunities are so vast and the stakes are so high
                            that it is worth all of our efforts and worth all of our energy, for
                            water means life, and water means opportunity, and water means
                            prosperity for those who never knew the meaning of those words. Water
                            can banish hunger and can reclaim the desert and change the course of
                            history.” <persName>Johnson</persName> also said that the United States
                            was equally ready to cooperate through the IAEA with other countries
                            anxious to cure water shortages. (Public Papers of the Presidents of the

                            sensitive area, but that “our judgment is that this one can be handled
                            in such a way that in this case the criticism should be manageable. We
                            are not dealing with highly classified materials, and the object is one
                            of cooperation in which with any luck both sides would gain.”

                        <p>It is not yet clear whether the Soviets are really interested in
                            desalting which is a serious technical problem quite aside from nuclear
                            power or whether their real interest lies either in the possibility of
                            technical discussions on large nuclear reactors or of simply associating
                            themselves with us in this activity which they may feel has far reaching
                            significance in certain areas of the world such as the Near East. In the
                            latter connection, you should recall that we have recently entered into
                                <pb n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0267"/>a cooperative agreement
                            with Israel and that we have a continuing program with the International

                        <p>Finally, there is a problem of internal U.S. Government organization on
                            the desalting problem. Technically, desalting is the responsibility of
                            the Department of Interior; however, the Atomic Energy Commission has

                                        produced by large nuclear reactors could be used to

                                        that it would be cost-prohibitive for agricultural use. (<hi

                                <item>The plant envisaged would produce about 500 million gallons

                                    produces somewhat more than one million gallons per day.
                                    Therefore, a large research and development effort on
                                    distillation technology is needed before success can be

                                    therefore relatively more advanced than distillation

                            favorable prognosis by our report we have offered to share our
                            technology internationally, and in particular have committed ourselves
                            to cooperation with Israel. We are about to enter discussions with the
                            Soviet Union. Yet, we have no clear internal commitment to proceed down

                        <p>I urge, therefore, that in general terms we do commit ourselves to such a

                                we might have nothing to offer; I assured him that despite my
                                worries about our pace, we probably were more advanced than the
                                Russians but that in fact we knew very little about their position.
                                I inquired about his general attitude, and he said he wanted to go
                                all out for <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0270"/>cooperation and

                                Subsequent to our meeting, he called me back and we had a brief
                                discussion with <persName corresp="#p_GK3">Kermit Gordon</persName>
                                at which he repeated the points about <gloss target="#t_AEC1"

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Feldman</persName> announced that he had called a meeting
                            in his office to coordinate the various actions taking place
                            domestically and internationally regarding desalination. At a later
                            point in the meeting he stated that he envisaged desalination becoming
                            one of the planks of President <pb n="241" xml:id="pg_241" facs="0271"/>
                            <persName>Johnson</persName>'s “Great Society” program and that he was
                            seeking the basis for a major Presidential message on this subject next
                            spring.</p>
                        <p>The discussion ranged over many aspects of desalination. It revealed that
                            the desalination budget for Fiscal Year 1966 was entirely for research
                            and development—Interior's plans called for $33 million and <gloss
                                target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>'s for $11 million. It was pointed out
                            that although the Israelis were interested in having the desalination
                            reactor based on the heavy water technique, both <gloss target="#t_AEC1"
                                >AEC</gloss> and Interior were proceeding with a pressurized water
                            reactor. Commissioner Ramey pointed out that the heavy water reactor
                            would not be economically efficient unless an output of approximately
                            three hundred million gallons a day was anticipated. Moreover, U.S.
                            technology in the heavy water reactor is not yet developed.</p>
                        <p>There was some discussion of the problems inherent in attempting to
                            extrapolate by a factor of 100 the current desalination technique.
                            Extrapolations by a factor of four to five are much more customary and
                            there seems to be general agreement that the next step upward should be
                            a prototype plant capable of producing ten to fifteen million gallons a
                            day.</p>
                        <p>In response to Mr. <persName>Feldman</persName>'s query about the nature
                            of contemplated U.S. contributions to the Israeli project,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d134fn2">On October 14 the United States and Israel signed a

                                <persName>Ramey</persName> indicated that their agencies intended to
                            follow a hard-headed business approach of relating their financial
                            investment in the Israeli project to the technological information the
                            U.S. might derive from the project. It was agreed that U.S. financial
                            assistance to the Israelis on this project was a political question and
                            should be approached as such. Commissioner Ramey reported that a joint
                            U.S.-Mexico effort was in the offing and that discussions would begin
                            when the new Administration in Mexico had settled into office. Technical
                            discussions would also get under way with Egypt very shortly.<note n="3"

                            Joint Board being established to supervise engineering activities should
                            discuss U.S. financial assistance to the Israeli Government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Feldman</persName> stated that there was apparently a need
                            for coordination of the several governmental interests in desalination
                            both on a <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0272"/>technical and on a
                            policy level. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH7">Pollack</persName> reported
                            on a pending proposal for the State Department to establish an
                            inter-Departmental Committee to develop policy governing U.S.
                            participation in international desalination projects including the
                            nature of the financial arrangements. Mr. <persName>Feldman</persName>
                            stated that he thought it was a good idea to proceed simultaneously at
                            the engineering and the policy level and asked Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PH7">Pollack</persName> to send him some information on
                            the contemplated Committee. He also suggested that Treasury should

                        <p>On November 18, 1964, the United States and the Soviet Union concluded an

                        <p>It is becoming abundantly clear that foreign interest in U.S. desalting

                            with the Government of Israel and of the rapid development of U.S.
                            technical capacity in this field. Similarly, arrangements for U.S.
                            collaboration or assistance in projects abroad will become increasingly
                            frequent.</p>
                        <p>In order to assure that the foreign relationships arising out of the
                            desalting program are consonant with other foreign programs and policies
                            of the U.S., it is requested that no financial or other commitment
                            involving other countries be entered into without prior consultation
                            with and the approval of the Department of State.<note n="2"

                                Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s desire to
                                assert the State Department's role in this issue. On December 28

                        <p>In order to facilitate the provision of guidance on this subject, I am
                            establishing a Committee on Foreign Desalting Programs at the Assistant
                            Secretary level. I have asked the Director of International Scientific
                            Affairs to serve as Chairman. The Department of State will also be
                            represented by the Regional Bureau Assistant Secretaries as appropriate
                            to the agenda. The Agency for International Development, the Department
                            of the Interior, the Bureau of the Budget, and the Office of Science and
                            Technology are being invited to join the Committee. I would also be
                            pleased to have you designate a representative of the Atomic Energy
                            Commission to serve on the Committee.</p>
                        <p>The Committee will (1) maintain continuing surveillance over the status
                            of foreign desalting programs contemplating or using U.S. technical or
                            other assistance; (2) develop recommendations for policies and
                            guidelines to govern U.S. participation in such programs; (3) map and
                            coordinate the financial and other relationships with specific countries
                            with whom the U.S. is collaborating on desalting programs. The
                            Committee's deliberations will, of course, be in accord with the
                            political guidance respecting country relationships provided by the
                            geographic bureaus of the Department of State.</p>
                        <p>As we acquire experience in dealing with desalination programs abroad, it
                            may be expected that new or amended institutional arrangements will
                            become desirable. Should the need for this become apparent <pb n="244"

                            Interior's Office of Saline Water has agreed to provide technical advice

                        <p>We anticipate that the Department of the Interior-sponsored First
                            International Symposium on Desalination, to be held in Washington
                            October 3–9, 1965, will develop awareness throughout the world of
                            desalting possibilities and stimulate additional interest in many
                            countries for cooperation with the U.S. in this field. Fifty-three
                            countries and six international organizations have indicated their
                            intention to send representatives.</p>
                        <p>The technology of economical desalting is not much beyond its infancy.
                            The largest desalting plant now in operation produces 1.7 million
                            gallons per day (mgd). There is now in the detailed design phase a plant
                            intended to produce 50 mgd. The Israeli project relates to a plant
                            intended to produce 120 mgd to go into operation in 1970–71. The ability
                            to produce this much water at an economical price is dependent on
                            technology under development but not now on hand.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. investment in desalination research and development is in the
                            process of being doubled. We are being responsive to the repeated <pb

                            present day desalting technology is not oversold and that desalting is
                            kept in proper juxtaposition by interested countries with other possible

                            press for a major program decision so that the U.S. Government may have
                            a foreign aid “spectacular” to announce at the Desalination Symposium in
                            October. Ramey and Holum believe that the President is somehow committed
                            to making some sort of an announcement of a new development initiative
                            at that time and they are talking about a possible soft loan and grant
                            program of $300 million to assist in the construction of large-scale
                            combination nuclear power and desalting installations abroad.</p>
                        <p>The Bureau of the Budget doubts the need for any further initiative at

                            practical. <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName> feels that the

                        <p>There is an element of uncertainty in the picture due to the pressure
                            that will build up this fall to get the U.S. committed to a substantial
                            contribution to the Israeli plant. There has even been some talk in
                            Interior and <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> that the U.S. should
                            make up its mind on the Israeli project in time for an announcement at
                            the October Symposium. Such an announcement would then be considered as
                            precedent-making in terms of U.S. willingness to underwrite similar
                            projects in other countries.</p>
                        <p>I believe that the efforts of <gloss target="#t_OST1">OST</gloss> and BOB
                            will be successful in keeping this matter under control but there is
                            always the possibility of an end run. It seems that desalting has a
                            mystique of its own and somehow an impression has been given around town
                            that the President is personally committed to a major program of
                            assistance abroad. It is for this reason that I bring the above to your
                            attention. I will also send a copy of this memorandum to Bob Komer and
                            will keep him filled in on the Israeli developments as they occur in the

                            substantial argument developed by the proponents of the large scale
                            program is that of advancing the national prestige of the United States.
                            However, the technology of desalting, upon which a bid for national
                            prestige would be made, is not yet in hand. Breakthroughs can be
                            anticipated and major advances will undoubtedly be made. When these
                            occur it may indeed be propitious to launch a major international
                            program supported in part by United States resources to bring economic
                            water to the parched areas of the earth. In the interim the United
                            States is appropriately concentrating its efforts on research and the
                            development of the necessary technology; in the international field it
                            should cooperate with other countries extending them as much assistance

                                might to limit the power to destroy. We have been sitting at world

                            addition to capital subsidy) or 2) by resulting in a “lemon” which might
                            not operate satisfactorily without extensive and costly
                            modifications.</p>
                        <p>A dual purpose (power and water) plant of the type being considered for
                            Israel would produce water at about 35/1000 gallons. Since the water is
                            worth at most 20/1000 gallons to grow oranges (and less for any other
                            crop), the subsidy required would be about $5 million per year. A
                            “water-only” plant would produce water at a higher cost and therefore
                            would require a higher subsidy. The same problem comes up elsewhere in
                            the world except that it is harder to sell power in nations which are
                            less developed than Israel.</p>
                        <p>I think it might be appropriate for the President to point out that we
                            are just in the process of undertaking a five-year <gloss
                                target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss> program to cost nearly $200 million,
                            and to talk about overseas financial assistance, if at all, only in the
                            context of a future time, certainly after we have gotten authorization
                            for at least one plant here.</p>
                        <p>We must also consider the following very significant concerns: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The relation of the proposal to our existing foreign aid

                                    request this money before he has made any request for U.S.

                                <item>The foreign policy issues raised. The only concrete item in
                                    sight is the Israeli plant which raises the question of
                                    aggravation of Arab-Israeli problems implicit in U.S. assistance
                                    to a large plant in Israel.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>The questions raised in supplying, with U.S. financial aid,

                        <p>Some of these questions would be much easier if the President were to
                            propose an internationally managed loan fund analogous to the Southeast

                            resolving soon, because First International Conference on Desalting
                            opens here 3 October. Of course LBJ doesn't have to move then; he can
                            get just as much of a splash by moving later.</p>

                                rend="italic">premature</hi>. Yet if the President wants to push
                            ahead with a big initiative, I see a middle road.</p>
                        <p>The real argument is over the proposed $3–500 million <hi rend="italic"
                                >authorization</hi> request for “soft” financing abroad (the
                                <persName corresp="#p_USL1">Udall</persName>/<persName
                                corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> report says this means loans
                            repayable in dollars or local currency, or even grants) over a <hi
                                rend="italic">five-year</hi> period. Actual appropriations would be
                            requested annually as needed.</p>
                        <p>So this doesn't mean we'd waste $3–500 million right away on uneconomic
                            plants. We wouldn't even go up for the authorization till 1966, and
                            could hold off any big appropriations till later in the 1966–70 period.
                            We could also (a) eliminate the repayment in local currency and grant
                            feature or make it only a specified small percentage, say 10%, of the
                            total and earmark it solely for feasibility studies; (c) include an
                            interest requirement equal to the Treasury rate; (d) say that we
                            wouldn't go for an appropriation till FY 68—the year <hi rend="italic"
                                >after</hi> the authorization; and finally (e) make clear that we
                            would not use this money for uneconomic projects.</p>
                        <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0284"/>
                        <p>We could even include a provision requiring <hi rend="italic">joint</hi>
                            financing where a recipient's financial resources so permit. And we
                            could include a feature allowing local currency loans or grants from PL
                            480 proceeds (this could permit us to lend Israel, for example, up to
                            $50 million or so in Israeli pounds).</p>
                        <p>All this would also give us some money to go ahead with Israel <hi
                                rend="italic">when ready</hi>, which would please our Zionist
                            friends without committing us much beyond what is already in the cards.
                            And as a program not specifically addressed to Israel, it helps protect
                            our Arab flank (though we'd have to build an Arab plant too sooner or
                            later).</p>
                        <p>Ergo, it seems to me that we might be able to have our cake and eat it
                            too on this one.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The technology of economic, large-scale plants is as yet undeveloped. The
                            largest plant built so far is on the order of 2 million gallons per day.
                            The Interior-<gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> proposal contemplates
                            plants of 100 million gallons per day. Until we have a well-developed
                            and well-tested technology firmly in hand, we run the risk of supporting
                            plants that will be <hi rend="italic">uneconomical or which will not
                                work satisfactorily</hi>. The foreign policy implications of either
                            outcome could be very unfortunate. We ought not to be conducting what is
                            essentially a major <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss> program in
                            less developed countries. (Don Hornig has outlined this in more detail
                            in his September 14 memorandum to you, copy attached.)<note n="3"

                        </p>
                        <p>The proposal will involve high budgetary costs, particularly in fiscal
                            year 1967 (<gloss target="#t_NOA1">NOA</gloss> of $120–$190 million). In
                            addition, we run the serious risk of budgetary costs over and above
                            those now contemplated if the demand for plants is greater than the
                            number now planned. Since the Interior plan contemplates only two large
                            desalting plants, the question arises as to how we discriminate in
                            selecting sites. If the plants prove uneconomic, added budgetary cost
                            would surely arise. For example, the Israeli project could require
                            operating subsidies on the order of $5 million per year.</p>
                        <p>The proposal would mean support of large plants abroad in the absence of
                            a similar program at home. Congress has recently approved a 5-year
                            domestic program of $200 million <hi rend="italic">for research and
                                development only</hi>. A program to construct foreign plants raises
                            serious questions of Congressional acceptance, especially since we could
                            certainly test more efficiently in the United States.</p>
                        <p>The proposal raises serious questions of nuclear proliferation. We might
                            be supplying the capacity to produce plutonium to countries having
                            long-standing enmities with their neighbors. The amount of plutonium
                            generated by a 200 MWe plant would produce enough materiel annually for
                            a large number of nuclear weapons.</p>
                        <p>In addition, the Department of State, the Agency for International
                            Development, and the Treasury Department raise the following important
                            questions (see letters attached):<note n="4" xml:id="d143fn4">Not

                            <hi rend="italic">State</hi> believes that from the standpoint of
                            foreign policy we should refrain from committing the United States to a
                            specific, large-scale program to support plant construction and
                            operation overseas until the present uncertainties about our capacity to
                            build reliable and economic desalting plants now and in the near future
                            are resolved. The Department also believes announcement of such a fund
                            now would substantially predetermine a decision on U.S. financial
                            participation in the prospective Israeli project. This decision should
                            not be made until completion of technical studies now underway and a
                            thorough assessment is conducted of the economics and political
                            implications of the project.</p>

                            Agency further points out that this proposed use of resources weakens

                            also questions the use of concessionary financing in countries where we
                            are largely out of the aid business. The Agency also suggests that
                            earmarking of funds for specific types of projects distorts
                            developmental priorities.</p>

                            desalting plants until plans are firm enough to assess accurately the
                            effect on the balance of payments. The Department also questions the
                            advisability of “soft” loans to countries that are being phased out of
                            the aid program, and the desirability of funding a large-scale “<gloss

                            cooperative international effort to find solution for man's water
                            problems. The specifics of the program include: (1) presentation to the
                            next session of Congress of a plan and program for constructing
                            practical prototype plants; (2) a call to all nations to join the U.S.
                            in creating an international fund to bring the fruits of science and
                            technology to all the corners of a parched and thirsty world; (3) an

                            water resources; (4) the convening within a year of another large
                            conference to deal with all the world's water problems; (5) an increase
                            in U.S. support for scientists now working on water problems for the
                            United Nations; (6) an offer to send our best experts abroad when
                            requested; and (7) a program of grants and fellowships for scientists
                            from other lands to study on water resources in the United States.<note

                                “Let future generations remember us as those who freed man forever
                                from his most ancient and dreaded enemies—drought and famine. And

                            area of cooperation to water resources generally. Although the “Water

                                >Bell</persName> was quite opposed to the project; that if we did

                            for a particular target date for completion of negotiations—but project

                        <p>I believe that your project to develop a nuclear desalting plant jointly
                            with Israel might be exploited to bring nuclear disarmament and possibly
                            even some reductions of conventional armaments to the Middle East.<note

                            Apparently both Egypt and Israel would welcome an opportunity to reduce
                            their arms spending, if they could do so without <pb n="263"
                                xml:id="pg_263" facs="0293"/>increasing the threat to their security
                            from each other. In addition, Egypt can only do so if it did not appear
                            that she was making a deal with Israel. Egypt has a serious water
                            shortage in spite of the Aswan Dam, particularly in the desert region
                            close to Israel and is, I believe, anxious to participate in a project
                            similar to the one being planned with Israel. I have been told this by a
                            visiting Egyptian, and Arthur Goldberg has confirmed it in a discussion
                            with the Egyptian Ambassador to the U.N. Furthermore, the Egyptians are
                            very worried by the prospect of the Israelis making a nuclear bomb and
                            would like to head this off, as would we.</p>
                        <p>Israel is anxious to cut its arms costs and would, I am told, be willing
                            to experiment with a substantial cut in its defense expenditures next
                            year if they could be assured that the Egyptians would not increase
                                theirs.<note n="3" xml:id="d146fn3">In his March 11 memorandum,
                                Komer remarked: “Israel might conceivably agree to Jerry's scheme if
                                Nasser would agree to a freeze on any new conventional weapons. But
                                none of us old Arab hands see a prayer of this happening. As for
                                Nasser denying himself the nuclear option if we gave him a big
                                reactor too, why should we pay this price? Nasser has no nuclear
                                potential, so we'd be paying something for nothing.”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>In all of this there appears to be the hope of halting the Middle East

                        <p>The ingredients would be these: a nuclear desalting project with Egypt as
                            well as Israel, declarations by both countries—possibly registered with
                            the U.N.—that they will not undertake the development of nuclear
                            weapons. Agreement to permit inspection of all nuclear facilities by
                            inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency,<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d146fn4">In his March 11 memorandum, Komer wrote: “We have
                                already made clear to Israel that we would insist on IAEA controls
                                over any new desalting reactor we helped them build. But Jerry's
                                idea that we go further and insist they also put their
                                French-supplied Dimona reactor under IAEA would generate a violent
                                Israeli reaction (as already occurred in response to a false leak
                                that we were considering just this). The Israelis already allow us
                                to secretly police Dimona, anyway.”</note> and U.S. reprocessing of
                            all of the expended fuel elements from the desalting plants to prevent
                            either country from acquiring plutonium. Finally, and probably most
                            difficult, would be agreements to limit the buildup of conventional
                            arms. This could be done in many ways. An agreement to limit budgets at
                            present or somewhat lower levels would be one course. A freeze on the
                            acquisition of any new weapons is another. Without further exploration
                            it is not possible to say just how much is possible in this direction,
                            but it is clear that you have a powerful lever for use in pushing for
                            some conventional disarmament in the desire that exists for nuclear

                        <p>Not only is the need for water desperate in both countries, but also it
                            is certain to get worse. The prospect for providing unlimited amounts of

                            about a political miracle. In fact, I think that it already has; I
                            believe that your original announcement of the U.S.-Israel project had
                            much to do with halting the Jordan River crisis. When you pointed out
                            that there was a way to provide Israel with water from the sea, the
                            Arabs lost whatever real interest they previously had in the difficult
                            project of diverting the Jordan. The Israelis, in turn, were not quite
                            so fearful of the diversion.</p>

                                    project. (We would, however, privately inform Cairo at an
                                    appropriate time of our willingness to undertake an economic
                                    feasibility study in the United Arab Republic in the context of
                                    a possible understanding on safeguards with both Israel and the
                                    United Arab Republic.) Such an announcement should not be made
                                    before we have reached an understanding privately with the
                                    Israelis on what we have in mind to announce. Some delay in
                                    making the announcement would also help to mitigate a
                                    foreseeable tendency on the Arabs' part to associate the nuclear
                                    desalting issue with the announcement just made on our sale of

                                technically justifiable: “It seems to me altogether clear that
                                essentially concurrent construction of two large first-generation
                                desalting plants in pursuit of a single technology cannot possibly
                                be justified… . Any decision with respect to the Israeli plant must
                                therefore be based upon a careful study of its values in terms of
                                different economic and technological factors than those underlying

                            not address the economics of future water use. We know a lot less about
                            the UAR project. Since it is primarily a nuclear electric power plant
                            with a small desalting capability, the water economics will be
                            secondary; but we need to know whether the nuclear power plant would be
                            more economic than an oil-fueled one.</p>
                        <p>The economic analysis we have makes clear that the Israeli plant will not
                            produce water at currently competitive costs unless financed by grant or
                            at heavily concessional rates. Eshkol himself has said that only if the
                            project could be financed at “zero interest rate” could it be done
                            without putting an unacceptable strain on the Israeli economy.</p>
                        <p>To illustrate, Israelis estimate the current maximum value of
                            agricultural water in their remote southern Negev desert area at about
                            16 per 1000 gallons—which happens to be the actual cost of supplying
                            water there from the Jordan River diversion works. By comparison: <pb

                                <item>—And each of these costs should be increased by about 7 per

                            cost of water. For example, if 4.6% money were replaced by grant, the
                            cost would be lowered by 2 per 1000 gallons for each $10 million. But
                            with no concessional capital financing and at present water prices, an
                            annual subsidy of about $16 million would be required.</p>
                        <p>But these projections, based on present economic conditions in Israel,
                            are not a proper basis for decision. We need an authoritative evaluation
                            of the water economics of Israel in the 1970's. After all, the plant is
                            being considered because of future water shortage in the country.

                                <item>—Project into that context the relative advantages of

                            supply and use in the 1970's. Israel is one of the best case studies we
                            have, and we would like to put the best minds in the country on it.</p>

                                strongly urged Eshkol to accept safeguards as the best means of
                                controlling existing reactors. This has been our policy throughout
                                the Atoms for Peace program. However, despite our official
                                endorsement <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0298"/>of IAEA
                                controls, some disarmament experts are skeptical about the
                                effectiveness of IAEA safeguards in a crisis. With countries as
                                mutually hostile as Israel and the UAR, it is not hard to imagine a
                                situation in which they might cheat or try to abrogate the
                                safeguards. If they could get away with it, we would have enhanced
                                the potential of each to build nuclear weapons without establishing
                                compensating controls. From the viewpoint of preventing nuclear
                                proliferation, it might be better to have no new nuclear reactors in
                                the Middle East and to look more closely at desalting with
                                non-nuclear fuels, especially if nuclear desalting shows no clearcut

                            at nuclear safeguards by doing a project in both countries, to give us
                            bargaining leverage. (Jerry Wiesner wrote you along the same lines.) He
                            argues that one country would hardly forswear nuclear weapons unless the
                            other did, and the politics of the Middle East make it risky to help one
                            side on any nuclear project without balancing on the other.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, there are persuasive arguments against linking the

                                <item>—Helping the UAR would forfeit most of the political kudos we
                                    could expect from helping only Israel.</item>
                                <item>—It may not be politically feasible for some time to go ahead
                                    with any capital project in the UAR, much less a nuclear one. So
                                    it may be unwise to tie the Israeli project to a balancing
                                    project in the UAR. In any case, the UAR project is primarily an
                                    electric power plant and is, therefore, not symmetrical with the
                                    Israeli project.</item>
                                <item>—Nasser has little immediate hope of developing nuclear
                                    weapons. If we could strike a deal with Israel on safeguards, we
                                    might be able to persuade him to accept them without giving him
                                    a plant. After all, getting Israel off the nuclear track would
                                    be a big gain for him at little cost since he would be
                                    sacrificing no potential weapons of his own.</item>
                                <item>—It is probably unrealistic to expect Israel to accept
                                    safeguards on all its reactors. So a private deal with Israel on
                                    nuclear self-restraint may be the best we can hope for.
                                    Realistically, quiet bilateral U.S. approaches to both parties
                                    might be as good a bet as urging public commitment to

                            toward Israel calls for a shift to Title IV dollar sales. So no new
                            large holdings of local currency will be accumulating, and current
                            holdings are programmed to the hilt. Dave <persName corresp="#p_BDE1"

                            continuing subsidy. As nearly as we can tell from Executive Branch
                            discussions so far, it is unlikely that our coming recommendations on
                            the Water for Peace program will propose a new source of U.S. capital
                            aid for large-scale desalting plants. So for the $200 million project,
                            the only likely source of U.S. funds under current policies would be,
                            say, $50 million from Ex-Im. The rest would have to be raised in world
                            money markets at interest rates which would make the project uneconomic.
                            Based on likely sources of financing, the water cost appears closer to
                            47 per 1000 gallons than to the 35 cited in State's paper.</p>

                                    the UAR impractical in the immediate future. We also view Israel
                                    as the key to the safeguards question, since the UAR may

                        <p>The economic and technical feasibility study of the Israeli project was
                            completed in late March 1966. One of the principal conclusions of the
                            study was that “for the quantities of electricity (200 MWe) and water
                            (100 MGD) involved, and the cost of fossil fuel and the fixed charge
                            rates considered, a nuclear steam supply is more economical than a
                            fossil-fueled source.” But the figure of 28.6 cents/1,000 gallons was
                            exclusive of the costs of electrical transmission, water conveyance
                            facilities, and the cost of land. (Memorandum from <persName

                            Desalting Symposium in Washington in which he announced the beginning of
                            a Water for Peace program. This speech has been the main source of
                            guidance for the Interdepartmental Committee and its Task Force. The
                            essence of what he said was to call upon other nations to join us in
                            creating an “international crash program to deal with the world's water
                            resources” and a special international water fund. He announced his
                            intention to convene within a year an international conference “to deal
                            with all the world's water problems” and his support for international
                            research programs and other efforts to improve knowledge and skills in
                            the water resources field.</p>
                        <p>Our Committee has selected twelve from the comprehensive recommendations
                            in the draft report of the Task Force that seemed especially appropriate

                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>We singled out community water supply for the direct personal
                                    use of people as warranting high priority. This is also fully in
                                    line with the emphasis in the President's speech. However, we
                                    recognized that water resources are only one important economic
                                    resource and that plans and programs for water projects must be
                                    based on each country's own broader development needs.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>We found that in virtually all developing countries there is a
                                    lack of understanding of many aspects of their water problems,
                                    lack of basic data, lack of trained personnel and, in short, an
                                    inability to deal with their problems. Hence, we placed a high
                                    priority on training, education and related efforts to improve
                                    this situation.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Capital assistance will be required in larger amounts than in
                                    the past, but in the immediate future existing international
                                    sources seem adequate. We should be watchful to see that capital
                                    sources are replenished if and when needed to finance expanded
                                    water development projects. The obstacles to establishing a new
                                    international fund for water projects at this time are
                                    formidable and it has not been included in the initial program.
                                    If normal international sources are ever inadequate, we should,
                                    of course, reconsider the idea and explore with others the
                                    desirability of forming a special international water
                                    fund.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>Desalting has an especial appeal; it is dramatic; the United
                                    States has a leading position in this field; large-scale
                                    projects might well contribute to technological progress. We
                                    favor using this technique in areas where it makes good economic
                                    sense. The relative costs of other <pb n="273" xml:id="pg_273"

                                    weighed. We realize that certain imponderables, including
                                    political considerations, should be taken into account. Each
                                    case should be judged on its individual merits.</item>

                                    other nations to improve their water resources, it is in our
                                    interest to follow through on President <persName

                                    related to food and health programs, in which the United States
                                    is very active. We also would appear to have a responsibility
                                    and an opportunity to be of all possible assistance in this
                                    critical area. We should embrace the opportunity as a

                                    with global needs. The water problem, like the food problem, is
                                    partially the result of the population explosion.</item>

                                <item>It is tentatively estimated that the priority recommendations
                                    might cost about $30 million the first year, $50 million the
                                    second year, and might level off at about $90 million the third
                                    year. These are still very rough estimates. We do not plan to
                                    suggest any specific year for the first year, leaving the White

                        <p>The appointment of a U.S. coordinator on desalting projects in Israel and
                            the United Arab Republic was considered and discussed in the summer of
                            1966. According to a June 7, 1966, memorandum from
                                <persName>Rostow</persName> to the President, the appointment was a
                            sensitive one because of the large sum of money involved and because
                            desalination touched on the issue of nuclear power regulation. Israel
                            was interested and preferred that the coordinator be attached to the
                            White House rather than to the State Department. Israel approved of W.

                            21 (see <ref target="#d147">Document 147</ref>), but he was not chosen.

                            29 that “<persName corresp="#p_BE6">Bunker</persName> is OK with his
                            clients,” and that “<persName corresp="#p_BE6">Bunker</persName> tells

                                <persName>Rostow</persName> noted: “Apart from the <persName

                            leftover $6 million, this is the last such Israeli aid move we
                            anticipate before November 8th.” (Ibid., Memos to the President)

                            announced the appointment during a press conference on October 13; see

                            >Bundy</persName>, Harold Saunders recollected: “The main reason for
                            appointment <persName corresp="#p_BE6">Bunker</persName> was that we
                            could not trust any element of the bureaucracy to provide a
                            dispassionate recommendation for the President on desalting in Israel
                            since so many emotions pro and con were involved. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE6">Bunker</persName>'s job was first—and maybe most

                                            economic data (perhaps with the help of a good economist
                                            or other specialist) to find out whether further study
                                            is needed. A clear picture of Israel's water position in
                                            the 1970's is needed to determine how much concessional

                                            involved if we went ahead. Don Hornig argues rightly
                                            that we should not pile one study on another, and the

                                            and content of his first approach to the
                                            Israelis.</item>
                                        <item>—Look especially closely at the problem of requiring
                                            the Israelis to accept IAEA safeguards on this, Dimona
                                            and all future reactors. Our current position is to make
                                            this our price for going ahead with a nuclear plant. We
                                            know the Israelis will not accept this condition
                                            readily, if at all. But we would stick with our position
                                            rather than prompting the bureaucracy to begin thinking
                                            about fallback positions already. However, our
                                            coordinator will have to know this problem inside out to
                                            argue our case with the Israelis. Moreover, we must be
                                            realistic about Israeli resistance on this point and
                                            will have to know whether there are other good ways to
                                            achieve our objective.<note n="6" xml:id="d152fn6">The

                        <p>Enclosed with this letter are preliminary cost estimates at two possible

                        <p>We have made no specific recommendation regarding the international fund
                            you foresaw in your October 7 address. We have concluded that in the
                            immediate future international funding sources seem adequate, but we
                            will keep the need for international funds under constant review.</p>
                        <p>Although we propose that a Water for Peace office should be established,
                            and agree that both Departments must be involved in its operation and
                            management, we have not attempted to delineate at this juncture
                            precisely how this effort would be organized. This we will do after
                            receiving your reaction to our program recommendations.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the $1.2 million appropriation to finance the
                            International Water for Peace Conference which is being requested in the
                            current fiscal year, we have also agreed to seek $2.5 million to finance
                            fiscal year 1967 United States activities in support of the
                            International Hydrological Decade which will provide an essential
                            scientific base for the Water for Peace Program.</p>

                            because I am concerned about the management of the program. The report
                            is deficient in that it does not adequately deal with responsibility for
                            implementation.</p>
                        <p>As an integrated program, the priority items could add up to something
                            worthwhile and reasonably exciting. Generally these items, while
                            individually perhaps not dramatic, are directed toward improving
                            conditions which now inhibit the effectiveness of our international <pb
                                n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0309"/>water program. Some systematic
                            attempt to deal with them could result in considerable improvement.</p>
                        <p>The report suggests a Water for Peace office having a coordinative role
                            guided by an interdepartmental committee. It does not say where the
                            office is to be located. I think the attractiveness of the program will
                            depend on having someone in charge with sufficient rank and a directive
                            to do the job. In short, if we want to go ahead, the President probably
                            ought to appoint someone and tell him to get the job done. While I
                            recognize Interior's interest in water, I think the leadership here
                            belong in State and the job might either be added to one of the
                            Secretary's assistants for “Food for Peace” or “Fish and Wildlife” or
                            perhaps a new one added.</p>

                        <p>Jim Ramey has been, as you know, an effective crusader in this effort.
                            The memorandum reflects impatience at the pace of progress and with
                            those who have had reservations about the program.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d155fn3">Ramey wrote in his memorandum: “That brings me to
                                the principal problem that we face in the nuclear-desalting
                                program—the doubters! … the program seems to have more than its
                                share of persons in a staff review capacity who are inveterately
                                negative and unconstructive in approach. For example, experience on
                                the Committee on Foreign Desalting has been very frustrating
                                (despite the good efforts of its Chairman) because of the negativism
                                of the representatives from agencies other than Interior and <gloss

                                answering superficial questions, rather than getting on with the job

                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>I have followed this field closely for some years as State Department
                            planner. If there is any bureaucrat in this town who wants to see this
                            program go operational more than Jim Ramey, it is I; for it could have
                            immense foreign policy and human benefits.</p>
                        <p>The problem has been that technology has not yet yielded us economic
                            irrigation water by this route; and various bureaucrats have been afraid
                            of getting us into either excessive subsidies or actual white
                            elephants.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, I am not personally convinced that calculations of
                            those who have resisted are the last word. I keep remembering that we
                            would not have built the transcontinental railway on a conventional
                            cost/benefit basis.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, I place great store by the <persName corresp="#p_BE6"
                                >Bunker</persName> exercise. I believe he must keep his mind equally
                            open to Ramey and (say) the Budget Bureau; and he must be equipped with
                            some first-rate men who have not been fighting this war. Properly
                            conducted, the Israeli exercise plus the project firming up for the
                            Metropolitan Water District in California should give us some hard
                            answers.</p>
                        <p>In addition, I am told, the Water for Peace Conference will take up
                            nuclear desalting in a serious way.</p>
                        <p>As for your meeting the experts, I believe the right occasion would be a
                            session with <persName corresp="#p_BE6">Bunker</persName> when he is far
                            enough along.</p>
                        <p>I assume you will wish me to make Jim Ramey's memorandum quietly
                            available to <persName corresp="#p_BE6">Bunker</persName>.</p>

                            that purpose to be held in Washington in the Spring of 1967. He referred
                            to the Conference once again in early September of this year.<note n="2"

                        <p>It seems important to me that the President be made aware of this

                        <p>In November 1966, the Soviets requested consideration of a renewal of the
                            2-year-old bilateral desalting agreement (see <ref target="#d135"
                                >Document 135</ref>), scheduled to expire at the end of the month.

                            Soviet unresponsiveness to both the terms of the 1964 agreement and to
                            his efforts to renew the general “peaceful uses agreement” between the
                            two countries. (<persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>, Journal,
                            Volume 13, page 547) According to an undated Atomic Energy Commission
                            chronology, since the 1964 agreement the United States had sent at least
                            four letters proposing methods of implementation and six technical
                            reports on desalting but had received neither documents nor firm
                            responses in return. (Department of Energy, Archives, Records of the
                            Atomic Energy Commission, Secretariat Files, Folder 7) According to
                                <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>'s journal entry,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that the Soviets
                            “have a basic posture on this thing—there won't be anything that gets a
                            lot of publicity or anything new … until the Vietnam situation is over.”
                            He recommended renewal as “consistent with the President's philosophy.”

                        <p>In early December the Embassy in Moscow delivered a positive response to
                            the Soviet request, following Department instructions to “express hope

                            substantially higher than under lifespan of original agreement.”

                            Officials at the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs were surprised to
                            hear of their own government's lack of responsiveness. (Telegram 3472
                            from Moscow, December 5; ibid.) According to a Department of Energy
                            report, 35 reports and 2 books on desalination were sent by the Soviets
                            under cover of a December 24 letter, which also promised responses to
                            the other proposals. (Ibid.)</p>

                            The refusal to attend was said to be based on the fact that invitations

                        <p>The Water for Peace Conference is an initiative of the President,
                            himself. He has referred to the Conference in three public statements.
                            When the authorizing legislation was in jeopardy of being passed over in
                            the closing hours of the last Congress, the President personally
                            intervened to assure its passage. We have ample evidence of the
                            President's commitment to this Conference.</p>
                        <p>Failure of the Soviets to participate in the Conference would be a
                            serious blow not only from the loss of the technical contribution which
                            we know the Soviets can make but also to the theme of the Conference.

                                Secretary of the Interior, Stewart Udall, had written to Ambassador

                        <p>One of the technical papers presented at the Water for Peace conference,
                            entitled “Desalted Water for Agriculture” by R. Philip Hammond,
                            hypothesized that, with demonstrated methods of agriculture and
                            “virtually demonstrated” methods of nuclear desalting, food could be
                            grown with water costing 3 cents per day per person. (<hi rend="italic"
                                >International Conference on Water for Peace</hi>) Alvin Weinberg,
                            Director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee,
                            was convinced, based on the work of his own institution, that these
                            price estimates were “not unreasonable.” After reading the paper in
                            draft, Weinberg determined that more research was needed, and passed the
                            paper on to Dr. J. George Harrar at the <persName corresp="#p_RJD1"
                                >Rockefeller</persName> Foundation because of his “longstanding
                            interest in the development of countries, such as Mexico, that suffer
                            from a lack of water.” Weinberg noted that the <gloss target="#t_AEC1"
                                >AEC</gloss> was planning to conduct a small study to assess the
                            credibility of this proposal during the summer and promised to send
                            Harrar the results. (Letter from Weinberg to Harrar, March 23, 1967;

                        <p>Hammond's proposal focused on the creation of “agro-industrial” complexes
                            or food factories. Weinberg wrote: “The idea of producing food in
                            underdeveloped countries in 'food factories' rather than on farms seems
                            very appealing to me. For if agriculture can be converted into an
                            industrial operation in which a few experts make the primary decisions,
                            and the workers carry out carefully specified tasks, one in principle
                            avoids the problem of convincing countless peasants to change their
                            individual farming methods.” (Ibid.) Harrar was also enthusiastic about
                            the benefits, but cautioned that he was “not clear as to how quickly
                            such an operation on some major scale might come into being
                            economically.” He added that in a recent discussion with Israeli
                            President David Ben-Gurion, “I understand that it is his hope and plan
                            that atomic power for water desalination may become a reality in the
                            Negev one day.” (Letter from Harrar to Weinberg, May 10; ibid.)</p>

                            economics” of Hammond's proposal was underway. Although no conclusions
                            had been reached, the trend was positive. “When these ideas were first
                            discussed within the nuclear community, they were generally received
                            with skepticism,” Weinberg explained. “However, in the past few months
                            there have been enough technical developments, particularly in the
                            technology of desalting the sea, to cause people to look much more
                            seriously at the matter. In particular, <gloss target="#t_AEC1"

                        <p rend="flushleft">Dear <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Dean</persName>:</p>
                        <p>The recent developments in the Middle East prompt me to recall to your
                            attention certain projects which have been under consideration for this
                            region for some time in the past. I am referring to the two dual-purpose
                            nuclear desalting projects, one proposed for installation in Israel and
                            the other proposed for installation in the United Arab Republic, which
                            were the subject of your memorandum to the President of May 21,
                                1966,<note n="2" xml:id="d163fn2">
                                <ref target="#d147">Document 147</ref>.</note> and with respect to
                            which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE6">Bunker</persName> was
                            serving as the President's special coordinator.</p>
                        <p>We recognize that the situation in the Middle East is enormously complex
                            and that the question of what disposition should be made of these
                            projects may not appear to be one of urgent priority. Nevertheless, it
                            occurs to us that the possible usefulness of these projects in the
                            overall settlement of the Middle East dispute may be rather significant
                                <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290" facs="0320"/>and that they should not be
                            lost sight of in the efforts which are now under way to develop a
                            possible settlement.</p>
                        <p>As you know, both Israel and the UAR have attached considerable
                            importance to their respective projects. The proposed Israeli project,
                            in particular, always had the advantage of providing Israel with a
                            source of water not subject to interruption by neighboring states and
                            not dependent on the allocation of the already inadequate water
                            resources of the Jordan Valley. Once again, it seems to me that the
                            recent events may well intensify the problem of water allocation in the
                            area rather than ease it. One or more desalting plants would both add
                            significantly to the total volume of water available to the region and
                            help overcome the problems of excessive salinity of Lake Tiberias, which
                            is currently a limiting factor on the usefulness of the waters of the
                            lower Jordan.</p>
                        <p>We believe it is interesting to note that at the recent Water for Peace
                            Conference in Washington, which took place after the Middle East crisis
                            had developed, UAR and Israeli representatives participated in a
                            collateral meeting of nations interested in nuclear desalting and
                            reaffirmed the strong interest of their governments in these
                            projects.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, it has been recognized that there could be substantial
                            political advantages to the United States in giving support to these
                            projects. Among other things, proceeding with the projects would
                            introduce international safeguards into the area on a major scale, and
                            U.S. assistance could possibly be used to secure Israeli agreement to
                            place its entire nuclear program, including the Dimona project, under
                            IAEA safeguards. It seems to me that the recent events probably increase
                            rather than decrease the danger that one or more of the Middle Eastern
                            countries will feel, however mistakenly, that its best interest in the
                            future would be served by the acquisition of nuclear weapons.</p>
                        <p>We recognize that questions have been raised as to the economic
                            desirability of these proposed projects. The study completed by
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE6">Bunker</persName> before his
                            departure led, in our view, to a favorable finding on this point. It
                            demonstrated that the water that would be supplied by the proposed
                            Israeli project would have substantial value to the Israeli economy,
                            although, as anticipated, outside assistance would be required to
                            overcome the gap between the tangible value of this water and its cost
                            of production in the proposed dual-purpose plant.</p>
                        <pb n="291" xml:id="pg_291" facs="0321"/>
                        <p>We believe that the possible role that these projects could play in the
                            Middle Eastern settlement is such that the financial assistance that
                            they would require is more readily justifiable now than any time in the
                            past. As first plants of their kind, they would give each country a
                            start in the application of a technology which, with the improvements
                            which we believe are inevitable, can play a major role in the future
                            peaceful development of this area.</p>
                        <p>As you know, we have made extensive studies of this project and will be
                            most pleased to cooperate with the Departments of State and Interior,
                            and with the NSC Committee just named by the President, in giving them
                            urgent consideration in the coming weeks. Commissioner Ramey is in
                            frequent touch with members of your staff in connection with these
                            projects and I have asked him to take responsibility for any necessary
                            follow-up.</p>

                                June 25. Eisenhower repeated for the President remarks he had made
                                to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>: “I
                                said as I study this problem, there are two problems in the Mid-East
                                that have got to be settled before there is ever going to be even a
                                modus operandi there in the Mid-East. One of them is these waters
                                and the other one is these refugees.” Eisenhower suggested setting
                                up a corporation in which the United States would own 51 percent of
                                the stock and sell the remainder to bankers around the world.
                                    <persName>Johnson</persName> was noncommittal and said that

                                    reported from London on a similar proposal by financier Edmund
                                    de Rothschild for three nuclear desalting plants for Israel,
                                    Jordan, and the Gaza Strip to assist in the resettlement of more
                                    than 200,000 refugees. British Prime Minister <persName

                                    technical-economic feasibility of the plan, but the Foreign
                                    Office was concerned about the cost. According to Embassy
                                    officials in London: “Apart from the obvious political
                                    difficulties, it was mainly a question of a very large amount of
                                    cheap money, which the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> did not
                                    have available.” Rothschild was apparently willing to put up 1
                                    million pounds sterling of his own money. (Airgram A–222 from

                            President Eisenhower. However, on July 11, 1967, Dr. Alvin Weinberg,
                            Director of the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>'s Oak Ridge National
                            Laboratory, visited me on behalf of Admiral Strauss to tell me of the
                            memo to Eisenhower and to outline their general line of thinking.
                            Tomorrow (Thursday, July 27) Admiral Strauss will call on me and at that
                            time I hope to get a copy of the memo.<note n="4" xml:id="d165fn4">

                                was their hope that you would take it up as your plan.” Strauss also
                                made explicit the link between this proposal and Rothschild's
                                proposal: “Both he and <persName corresp="#p_CLHMF1">Lord</persName>

                                    intensive scientific farming. By optimum use of water, much less
                                    would be needed and its value enhanced. For example, instead of
                                    the U.S. average of 4000 gallons of water per day to feed one
                                    person, one could get by on 200 gallons/day;</item>

                            power (2,400,000 kilowatts) which would be produced. My intention is
                            simply to listen to Admiral Strauss and to get something in writing if I

                        <p rend="center">A PROPOSAL FOR OUR TIME</p>
                        <p>Attention to the debates in the United Nations since the end of May must
                            convince the observer that an end to the trouble in the Near East is not
                            in sight. The introduction of a new and dramatic element will be
                            required to establish a climate in which peace can begin to be
                            negotiated. The resources of diplomacy appear exhausted, and the “lie
                            direct” has been exchanged so often that men can hardly be expected to
                            reach agreement by rational discussion in the atmosphere which has been
                            created.</p>
                        <p>The two fundamental problems in the Near East are (a) water, and (b)
                            displaced populations. It is these issues basically which have
                            exacerbated international relationships in that area over the years, and
                            they are not to be resolved by political or military measures. By a
                            simple, bold, and imaginative step, it is in our power to solve both
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>Let a corporation be formed with a charter resembling that of Comsat,
                            with the Government subscribing to half of the stock, the balance to be
                            offered for public subscription in the security markets of the world.
                            The amount thus to be raised, say $200,000,000, would be used to begin
                            construction of the first of three large nuclear plants for the dual
                            purpose of producing kilowatts of electrical energy and desalting sea
                            water, with emphasis on the latter purpose.</p>
                        <p>Two of the installations would be located at appropriate points on the
                            Mediterranean coast of Israel and a smaller one at the northern end of
                            the Gulf of Aqaba in either Jordan or Israel, as the most suitable
                            terrain may dictate. Design and construction contracts would be let on
                            bids in the several countries which have had experience in building
                            large nuclear reactors, i.e., the United States, the United Kingdom,
                            France, and the U.S.S.R.</p>

                        <p>The cost of the plants, beyond the sum raised by subscription to the
                            common stock, would be financed in succeeding steps by an international
                            marketing of convertible debentures. These would bear no interest for
                            the first years (approximately the time required to construct the first
                            plant).</p>
                        <p>Operation of the plants would be made the responsibility of the
                            International Atomic Energy Agency, of which agency each of the major
                            belligerents, fortunately, is a member, and that agency would also have
                            jurisdiction and control of reprocessing of fuel elements to insure that
                            all nuclear material was accounted for. The International Atomic Energy
                            Agency would also sell the power and water and service the debentures
                            with the proceeds.</p>
                        <p>During the Eisenhower Administration, the United States allocated for
                            peaceful uses overseas considerably more than sufficient uranium to fuel
                            these installations, and it is still available. The first plant would be
                            designed to produce daily the equivalent of some 450,000,000 gallons of
                            fresh water (incidentally, more than the combined flow of the three main
                            tributaries which make up the Jordan River). It would also produce an
                            amount of power which, though in excess of the present needs of the
                            area, would attract industry and would be used to pump the fresh water
                            into the water-starved areas of Israel, Jordan, and other Arab
                            countries—perhaps even including part of Egypt east of the Nile
                            Valley.</p>
                        <p>The introduction of fresh water from all three plants into the arid and
                            semi-arid areas would have the effect of opening to settlement many
                            hundred square miles which heretofore have never supported human life
                            (other than on a nomadic basis), and the controversy over the division
                            of the Jordan River would become de minimis.</p>
                        <p>The work of building the great plants, laying the pipe lines,
                            constructing reservoirs, power lines, irrigation ditches, etc., will
                            absorb the unskilled labor of thousands of displaced persons. When the
                            plants are in operation, the labor force could be settled in irrigated
                            areas under conditions far superior to any life that they have ever
                            experienced.</p>
                        <p>Solely as a measure of magnitude, it might be noted that the completed
                            project will represent substantially less than one year's expenditure on
                            the moon program. It will pay for itself and return income in
                            perpetuity, retiring the borrowings incurred and rewarding the
                            governments and individuals with vision enough to have subscribed to it
                            initially.</p>
                        <p>Cooperation of the Arab and Israeli governments will be necessary in
                            order to agree upon a modus vivendi for allocating water and power, and
                            it will be apparent that any government which simply declined to discuss
                            or participate in such a cooperative arrangement would have to answer to
                            its citizens sooner or later.</p>

                        <p>Were the President of the United States to electrify the world by such a
                            proposal, as President Eisenhower did in his Atoms-for-Peace speech to
                            the United Nations in 1953, it would be hailed and welcomed by millions
                            who now can see no way out of the morass in which the powers are
                            presently floundering with its threat of triggering more widespread war.
                            The proposal might well be the beginning of a new life in the lands of
                            the oldest civilizations.</p>
                        <p>The proposal, of course, does not settle the boundary disputes and other
                            acute issues now confronting the belligerents, but their settlement
                            would be immensely accelerated and facilitated by the pressure from all
                            sides to get ahead with such a project where delay would be counted in
                            human lives and misery. It could be announced that no affirmative steps
                            would be taken until negotiations at least began. In the atmosphere that
                            would immediately follow such a proposal, the leaders of the Near
                            Eastern countries would be invited to come together on the basis of the
                            proposals. They have a common forum in the International Atomic Energy
                            Agency.</p>
                        <p>Private capital both in the United States and Great Britain would
                            certainly respond to the challenge of such an enterprise on the
                            initiative of the Government.</p>
                        <p>Footnote: It may be argued that the cost of de-salted water if it exceeds
                            15 per thousand gallons will be too high for agriculture (though citrus
                            farming can use water at more than twice this figure). There was an
                            identical objection by those who counselled the Atomic Energy Commission
                            that the development of electrical energy from nuclear fission would
                            never be economic. Although the advice came from respected scientific
                            quarters, it proved to be wrong. The Commission found that the cost per
                            kilowatt hour fell very rapidly as the size of plants increased (from an
                            estimated 18 mills per k.w.h. to less than 3 mills, and the cost is
                            still going down). Within the past year, nuclear power has become fully
                            competitive with power conventionally produced, and more than half of
                            the new power plants contracted in the United States in 1966 are
                            nuclear. The same factors will lower the cost of water.</p>

                        <p>Under present circumstances, we think it would be wise if and when an
                            announcement is to be made to tab him as your negotiator on water
                            throughout the Middle East. We don't at this stage know for sure what
                            more that might involve than completing the Israeli negotiations if you
                            decide to go ahead. However, it would be bad politically for us right
                            now to move ahead with a big project in Israel alone, and there may be a
                            time when a combined Israeli-Jordanian or Israeli-Egyptian water project
                            of some kind could be a dramatic and constructive contribution to a
                            political settlement.</p>

                            Office, we would envision him as being “Mr. Inside”—pulling together our
                            planning effort both in and out of government. <persName

                        <p>After news of the Eisenhower-Strauss proposals appeared in the press, on
                            June 25, 1967, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                            spoke to the former President to assure him that the administration was
                            considering a variety of water programs (see <ref target="#d164fn2"
                                >footnote 2, Document 164</ref>). In a personal letter of July 28,
                            Eisenhower reminded <persName>Johnson</persName> that his interest in
                            nuclear desalting was a long-standing one and to assure him “that my
                            support of this kind of work is both disinterested and non-partisan.”
                                (<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, White House Central Files, EX
                            UT 4) In his July 31 response to Eisenhower,
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> wrote: “I know we have both long felt
                            in our bones that the time when desalting would become economic for
                            irrigation could be made a great constructive turning point in human
                            history and, in particular, a basis for movement towards reconciliation
                            in the Middle East.” (Ibid.)</p>
                        <p>A briefing on water issues was scheduled for the former President,
                            according to a list of pending measures from the NSC Special Committee
                            meeting of August 10. A handwritten comment by Saunders reads: “and tell
                            him Strauss already has the Senate up in arms—” (NSC Special Committee,
                            August 10; ibid., National Security File, NSC Special Committee Files,
                            NSC Special Committee—Suspense, HHS) On August 14 Republican Senator
                            Howard Baker, Jr. and 52 co-sponsors submitted a sense-of-the-Senate
                            resolution calling for the “prompt design, construction, and operation
                            of nuclear desalting plants” as a means to alleviate the Middle East's
                            “chronic shortage of fresh water, useful work” and lack of an “adequate
                            food supply.” The sponsors argued that these economic benefits could
                            provide the basis for a “stable and durable peace” in the region. (<hi

                        <p>As you know, we decided back in June that the US should not be the
                            obvious author of a big economic plan for the Middle East.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d169fn2">No record of such a decision occurring before the
                                Strauss-Eisenhower proposal has been found, but in an August 29
                                memorandum to Valenti, <persName>Rostow</persName> noted: “Shortly
                                after the Mid-East war ended, we decided that we ought to avoid the
                                appearance of developing any big US economic plan for the area. We
                                thought the 'made in the USA' label might kill a good idea, and
                                besides, the President has taken the general line that, by standing
                                back, we might draw out local initiative. (I'm sure you above all
                                understand this tack.) However, we recognized the importance of
                                having such a plan. We asked the World Bank whether it could do the
                                quiet planning necessary to undergird a possible economic proposal
                                to be made at the right political moment.” (Ibid.)</note> Therefore,
                            we stimulated the World Bank to do the job, and its staff is at
                            work.</p>
                        <p>However, we have one operational problem for which we can not depend on
                            the Bank's help. In any case, the Bank's plans probably wouldn't be
                            ready in time to do us any good.</p>
                        <p>This problem is the probable necessity of renewing discussions on the
                            Israeli desalting plant. The updated Kaiser study will be ready in its
                            final form by the beginning of October. Shortly thereafter, we can
                            expect the Israelis to want to begin talking where <persName

                        <p>Our problem—in addition to the technical and financial ones so familiar
                            to us—is what political quid pro quo to exact if we decide to go ahead
                            with this plant. This time last year we were talking about <pb n="302"
                                xml:id="pg_302" facs="0332"/>requiring the Israelis to put all their
                            nuclear activities under IAEA control in return for our cooperation. I
                            was never too sure that would be a feasible deal and it may be even less
                            so now that Israel's future security requirements are in a greater state
                            of flux. But entirely apart from that, we have new problems of wanting
                            to use anything we do in this field in the context of an overall
                            political settlement.</p>

                                <ref target="#d166">Document 166</ref>.</note> it's obvious that
                            desalting might inject a new element into management of water in the
                            Jordan River Basin. As I understand it, all the Jordan Valley plans to
                            date have been written in terms of water available from natural sources.
                            Now desalting makes it possible to bring new water sources—particularly
                            brackish and hitherto unusable water—into play. We need to know what
                            sort of Jordan Plan one might write making use of desalting
                            technology.</p>

                            vision to know what we can require of the Israelis to make their plant
                            the first phase of an overall Jordan Valley plan which might lead to a
                            second desalting plant sometime in the next few years.</p>
                        <p>What we would be shooting for is some Israeli commitment on future limits
                            on use of Jordan Valley water and their commitment to make that water
                            available for developing the West Bank. We have begun the staff work in
                            our refugee plan that moves us toward some kind of development
                            arrangement on the West Bank. What we have not done is the staff work
                            which would make it possible for us in very specific terms and
                            requirements to use the desalting plant as leverage to move the Israelis
                            toward the broader objectives of regional water management and refugee

                            carefully drawn terms of reference and without any publicity whatsoever.
                            Going ahead in this limited way by ourselves need not cross anything the
                            World Bank does. But I see no alternative at this stage to our putting
                            ourselves in a position to handle this initially bilateral negotiation
                            with Israel.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Last December, the Senate passed the Baker Resolution and now the House
                            is considering an identical one.<note n="2" xml:id="d170fn2">See <ref
                                    target="#d168">Document 168</ref>. An identical resolution was
                                introduced into the House of Representatives by Congressman William
                                D. Hathaway on February 5.</note> Both state that building large
                            nuclear desalting plants in the Mid-East will hasten peaceful
                            cooperation. Both request you to pursue this.</p>
                        <p>These, of course, stem from the Eisenhower-Strauss plan of last summer.
                            That, in turn, grew out of a study at Oak Ridge. That study developed a
                            theoretical model showing how one could build up around a big nuclear
                            desalting and electric power plant an industrial and agricultural
                            complex that could absorb the tremendous amounts of electricity that
                            such a plant would have to produce to make its water economical. The men
                            who ran that study made clear that further study would be needed to
                            apply this idea to any specific area.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, the most direct response to the Baker resolution would be to
                            follow up the Oak Ridge study, applying its theories to the
                            Mid-East.</p>
                        <p>However, that by itself doesn't make sense, and besides we'd like to go
                            the Baker resolution one better. We don't quarrel with its vision and
                            hope, but it is naive on two serious counts: <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304"

                                <item>—Fresh water alone won't solve the problems that block peace
                                    in the Mid-East. If we could devote the $1 billion or more
                                    Baker's dream would cost to resettling refugees in all kinds of
                                    jobs—not agriculture—we'd take a much bigger step toward
                                    settlement. That's not to say that water isn't important; but
                                    other issues are more basic.</item>
                                <item>—Nuclear desalting is not necessarily the most immediate,
                                    practical or economic way to bring more water to the area. It
                                    may be the best answer in Israel where most other sources of
                                    water are already being efficiently used well. But we still have
                                    a long way to go in developing ground water and other sources
                                    elsewhere.</item>

                        <p>The kind of study we would frame would be broader than just applying
                            nuclear desalting to the Mid-East. Oak Ridge could do that study, but we
                            would make that just one piece in a broader study applying other
                            advanced concepts of water management and development. We would bring in
                            some of the pioneers in our own water planning, and we would make our
                            work complement studies being done by <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Mac

                                    way of going wild with its ideas and getting nuclear desalting
                                    out of economic perspective. On the other hand, the economists
                                    are too skeptical of desalting. In looking around for someone to
                                    keep all parts of this effort in tune, we believe we should
                                    entrust this to your Water for Peace Office. If we're going to
                                    build that office up, now is the time. The alternative is to let

                                    fear that creates expectations beyond what we can deliver. We
                                    have concluded that the best bet is to say that the Water for

                                    report in this case to the Secretary through Luke Battle's
                                    Interdepartmental Regional Group for this purpose. We are

                                more of them could include participation by those Middle Eastern

                            of reference for these studies and determine how to finance them. We can
                            do something within the existing Budget, but we might judge that asking
                            for a small budget amendment (less than $1 million) would be worth
                            considering in order to engage the Congress immediately in
                            responsibility for its recommendations. (We believe Congressman Rooney
                            would be glad to support a small State budget amendment that would
                            contribute to Arab-Israeli progress, but we will be back to you on

                                economical and frankly admit that it would be a research and
                                development project. He is even thinking about the possibility of an
                                Indus type international consortium to finance such experimentation.
                                This fresh approach is probably healthy although the economic work
                                is still necessary, since we will have to determine costs whatever
                                we do. The operational question is whether the time has come to put
                                this up to the President as a recommendation and to begin discussing
                                procedures with the Israelis so that the President might frame a
                                proposal for Congress in their departing legislative

                                    and desalting equipment will make a viable, economically

                                    will come of these exercises because there are too many
                                    variables and it is not possible to make meaningful guesses

                                <item>I am advised that considerable desalting research is underway
                                    in West Germany, Italy and, to a lesser extent, France. Italy is
                                    particularly interested, I am told, because of the future need
                                    for water in developing the southern part of the country.
                                    Through State Department channels, these activities should be
                                    identified. Some mechanism for coordinating them should be
                                    created. U.K. produces nuclear power units and interest in
                                    desalting processes in that country should also be inquired

                                    figures—that the most effective procedure for the future should
                                    contemplate straightforward research and development projects
                                    which hopefully will produce great rewards in the future but
                                    would not be expected to yield immediate direct returns. I doubt
                                    the advisability of presenting desalting projects as good

                        <p>The subject has been under discussion within the United States Government
                            for almost five years. It has not proved possible to reach agreement on
                            the feasibility of financing the original proposal to construct a 100
                            million-gallon-per-day (MGD) desalting plant. That plant would have
                            required a subsidy of from $60–$70 million, only about 50 per cent of
                            which could have been justified as a grant for the advancement of
                            technology.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WGD1">Woods</persName> has now proposed the
                            construction of a smaller plant that would still be large enough to give

                            appears to be within the range of available financing. The proposal is
                            both practical and attractive as a logical next step in large-scale
                            desalting, and would be a first step toward larger-scale installations
                            which may be needed later. I believe that the Department should endorse

                                to utilize nuclear technology. He explained that “our disagreements
                                with the conclusions and recommendations of the report relate
                                particularly to whether the desalting plant should make use of
                                nuclear or conventional energy sources, with the size suggested for
                                the proposed plant, and with the method proposed for securing
                                Congressional appropriations.” (Letter from <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> to <persName

                                problems stemmed from the cost of nuclear power plants and their
                                competitiveness. As <persName>Rostow</persName> explained to the
                                President: “prices this spring in the nuclear desalting field have
                                jumped sharply. At the same time, the price of fuel oil has gone
                                down, making oil-fueled desalting more competitive. Our large
                                planned plant in California is up in the air until we can reconcile
                                problems created by these increased costs.” (Memorandum from

                            large 100–150 million-gallon-per-day (MGD) desalter and concentrate on a
                            40 MGD plant. He fully shares your goal of becoming able over the next
                            10–15 years to desalt seawater on a large scale, and he believes we
                            should push ahead with this plant “as a matter of priority.” He has two
                            main reasons for recommending a smaller plant than we initially
                            considered: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>He believes that the next logical step in developing the
                                    technology of large-scale desalting would be to build a 40 MGD
                                    plant. This would be enough larger (more than 5 times) than
                                    present plants to provide an important test of new technology at
                                    reasonable cost (about $58 million). We would gain almost as
                                    much in technological knowledge as we would from the $100
                                    million plus that would be needed at a minimum from us to help
                                    build the $250 million larger plant.</item>

                                <item>Taking this smaller bite, he feels, is the only way to cut
                                    through the highly emotional argument we've had for several
                                    years between the crusaders and those who don't believe the time
                                    is ripe yet for a $100–250 million leap of faith.
                                    Everyone—except possibly <gloss target="#t_AEC1"
                                    >AEC</gloss>—believes this has been George's main
                                    contribution.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>To simplify our financial problem, George believes we should concentrate
                            on desalting and get away from the idea of financing an Israeli electric
                            power plant as part of a dual purpose water and power plant. The
                            Israelis will be building new power plants right along to meet
                            increasing demand for electricity. He doesn't see why they shouldn't
                            provide the steam from one of these power plants as part of their
                            contribution while we concentrate on the desalter to turn that steam
                            into water.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, George proposes we take the necessary steps to get
                            Congressional authorization for Interior to spend up to $40 million on
                            this plant. In addition to the steam from the power plant, Israel would
                            provide $18 million using a loan from the World Bank or some other <pb
                                n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0341"/>such loan agency. While the
                            cost of water would still be very high, George believes the total
                            Israeli contribution would not exceed the actual value of the water to
                            Israel. Since the power plant would cost around $20 million, this would
                            add up roughly to a 50–50 split between us.</p>

                                <item>—George's strong words about “abandoning” or “holding in
                                    abeyance” the plan for a big dual purpose plant. They believe it
                                    is important to preserve the idea that this is just the first
                                    step toward a later expansion into a larger plant. Secretary
                                        <persName corresp="#p_USL1">Udall</persName> goes along with
                                    presenting this to the Congress as Phase I of a larger project,
                                    but he would say that Israel must fund later expansion by
                                    itself. George says he didn't mean to close any doors—just to
                                    re-focus for a moment.</item>
                                <item>—George's unwillingness to insist that the plant use nuclear
                                    fuel. His investigations persuade him that there's no economic
                                    advantage to nuclear over fossil fuel and that, if we ask
                                    Israelis to provide the steam-producing plant, the choice of
                                    fuel ought to be theirs. <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>
                                    believes we have a strong interest in nuclear desalting. <gloss
                                        target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> further feels we should keep
                                    our strings on that Israeli decision to be sure they buy US
                                    nuclear equipment with safeguards. <gloss target="#t_AEC1"
                                        >AEC</gloss> believes it could justify a contribution of
                                    $10–15 million to the power (not desalting) plant if it were
                                    nuclear and if our own California plant doesn't go ahead.
                                    Secretary <persName corresp="#p_USL1">Udall</persName> believes
                                    we should leave the choice of fuel open. (The Israelis, like the
                                    rest of us, would like to leave the choice of fuel open until
                                    they can decide what is most economical.)</item>
                                <item>—George's judgment that it's “not possible at this time to
                                    obtain financing in the amount [$244 million]<note n="4"

                                    plant because of the sympathetic attitude of the Joint Committee

                                    two Interior Committees. George's proposal for an Interior
                                    contribution would only go before the two Interior Committees
                                    which would be less cordial.</item>

                        <p>On this last point, Secreatry <persName corresp="#p_USL1"
                                >Udall</persName> thinks the Senate Interior Committee would be
                            receptive but is less sure about the House. However, he points out that
                            the FY 1970 expenditure would be only $5 million and remaining costs
                            would be spread over five years. Only about $1 million of the FY 1970
                            figure would be needed for Israeli planning. The rest would go for
                            testing some promising new technology which should go into the Israeli
                            plant. Interior should proceed with this testing in any case, and that
                            would cost about $4 million. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> feels
                            Congress might see even $40 million as “just another aid spigot” and
                            thinks Israel should foot even more of the bill than George recommends.
                            State recommends that we pick up about $30 million of the $40 million,
                            leaving the rest to Israel.</p>
                        <p>In searching for a reasonable compromise, I would stand with George in
                            saying that the fuel is an Israeli decision, but I would be a little
                            less emphatic in “abandoning” the goal of a larger plant. I don't
                            believe we are ready to commit ourselves yet, but I don't see why we
                            shouldn't be quite honest in saying we're neither opening nor closing
                            that door at this stage.</p>

                                <item>—Don feels that desalting technology has reached a stage where
                                    it's time to test a prototype of a large plant. He believes the
                                    40 MGD size George proposes is reasonable. Given the apparently
                                    indefinite delay in building the large plant in California, he
                                    thinks it's sensible to try the experiment in Israel. He accepts
                                    George's recommendation that we concentrate on the desalter and
                                    let Israel provide the power plant to produce the necessary
                                    steam. He does not believe we should commit ourselves to future
                                    expansion of the Israeli project.</item>
                                <item>—Charlie suggests that you let this decision ride. He
                                    questions the need to spend tight resources on a large
                                    experimental plant where the economic benefits are uncertain,
                                    especially when we are straining to keep your budget down. If a
                                    large desalting demonstration is to be undertaken, he would
                                    prefer that it be done in the US where technological access to
                                    the plant is assured over time. He specifically questions the
                                    Israeli site in view of the risk of building and operating the
                                    plant in a war zone. He feels that <gloss target="#t_AEC1"
                                        >AEC</gloss> funds should not be used to put <gloss

                                    on the scale contemplated by <gloss target="#t_AEC1"

                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>For these reasons, Charlie feels that if we go ahead with the Israeli
                            project the contribution be limited to $30 million, and like foreign
                            aid, we should require that procurement, construction, and operation
                            contracts be limited to US sources. Charlie agrees with Don that we
                            should not commit ourselves to future expansion of the Israeli project.
                            Charlie also agrees with <persName corresp="#p_WGD1">Woods</persName>
                            that we would get as much technology <pb n="313" xml:id="pg_313"

                        <p>Yesterday, I had a visit from Yaacov Herzog—Eshkol's chief assistant whom
                            you met at the Ranch—and General Ben Artzi—<persName corresp="#p_WGD1"
                                >George Woods</persName>' Israeli counterpart. George has shared his
                            thinking with them informally to see whether he was being realistic.
                            Yesterday, Herzog gave me the following message for you in Eshkol's
                            name: Eshkol deeply appreciates your continued attention to this
                            project, even in the closing days of your Administration. He thinks
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGD1">Woods</persName>' proposal is quite
                            reasonable, and he would be prepared to discuss details of how to
                            proceed. Herzog felt it would be helpful if you were to include this in
                            your legislative program.</p>
                        <p>The issues are:</p>
                        <p>1. Whether you wish to put George's proposal in your legislative program.
                            The advantage in doing so would be to put yourself on record with a
                            proposal for a feasible next step (a) in desalting and (b) in a program
                            which you launched with Israel in 1964. The disadvantage is that the
                            Congress may well disregard this proposal, leaving it in worse shape
                            than if it had been left to a riper time. I personally feel that, after
                            four years of pushing this, we should have a concrete proposal from
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> on the
                            record.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">Put it in the program<note n="5" xml:id="d174fn5">This
                                option was checked.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">No</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">Call me</p>
                        <p>2. Whether, if you put it in your program, you would seek authorization
                            for a US contribution of the full $40 million George suggests or press
                            the Israelis to pay even part of the desalting research costs and go for
                            only $30 million. In either case, only about $5 million would need to be
                            appropriated in FY 1970. The argument for the full $40 million is that
                            Israel would build the entire power plant (roughly $20 million plus more
                            than $1.5 million yearly for fuel) and assume the $18 million loan in
                            addition as its fair contribution. This would be about a 50–50 split
                            between us. The argument for $30 million is that Israel too will profit
                            in future plants from the results of the research and should contribute
                            to the desalter too.</p>

                            still political questions to be considered and that we would probably
                            not wish to begin construction if another war seemed likely. But these
                            are questions for the next Administration. The main issue is whether you
                            wish to propose this first step now or leave the issue entirely to the

                        <p>During the Eisenhower administration steady expansion in oil output and a
                            long period of price stability allowed the United States and United
                            Kingdom to focus attention on strategic defense of the Persian Gulf
                            region and the Soviet threat to long-term access; for documentation, see

                            were weakening and that closer U.S.-U.K. cooperation was necessary, the
                            State Department believed that the companies were strong enough to
                            resist producer-government pressure for the next few years.</p>
                        <p>Although global consumption nearly doubled during the 1950s, oil was
                            still plentiful and inexpensive. New production capacity outstripped
                            demand, resulting in a glut. In response, oil companies cut the posted
                            price of crude oil, which served as the basis for calculating net
                            profits in profit-sharing arrangements with producer governments. On
                            paper, oil seemed to be less profitable, although in most cases the
                            companies' net incomes increased and they were able to pay higher
                            dividends to shareholders. “This has not been lost on concessionary
                            governments, which maintain that the companies, notwithstanding their
                            pleas to the contrary, should be well able to increase their tribute to
                            the government.” (Note by the U.K. Government, May 1963; Department of

                            views” on strategic matters in the Persian Gulf in April 1963. Both
                            agreed on the need for the close interrelationship of the oil companies,
                            and they scheduled a series of petroleum talks for June 1963. See <ref

                        <p>In preparation for the talks, the State Department prepared a series of
                            memoranda on various aspects of the oil problem, including one that
                            spelled out the relationship between the oil companies and the
                            government. Oil was unique because of the size of the companies, because
                            it was vital to economic progress and national security, and because of
                            the close relationship between the companies and the producer states: “a
                            more direct relationship to foreign governments than is usually the case
                            with other business enterprises.” The memorandum noted the importance of
                            maintaining frequent contact with the oil companies in case a company
                            “at any time” ran into a “serious crisis in its relationship to a
                            foreign government,” but it concluded: “The United States Government is
                            most reluctant to intervene diplomatically in disputes between American
                            oil companies and foreign governments. Our view is that to do this,
                            except on very rare and critical occasions, is to undermine the
                            responsibilities of the companies themselves.” (Memorandum by <persName

                        <p>One result of the 1963 oil talks was that the United States and the
                            United Kingdom agreed to coordinate their advice to the international
                            oil companies. “The U.K. and U.S. Governments should therefore exchange
                            information on the general advice which they are giving to their
                            companies and consult beforehand as appropriate in regard to advice
                            given in regard to specific disputes and problems of mutual concern.” On
                            the question of diplomatic intervention, the two nations agreed:
                            “Discreet and informal representation by a British or American
                            diplomatic representative abroad might from time to time, and in

                            (Ibid.) This position, with its emphasis on prior consultation, formed
                            the basis for U.S.-U.K. action on oil during the

                            had dealt with the agenda item in detail we did not have a great deal to

                                >Geoffrey</persName>'s comments.</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_HSG1">Geoffrey</persName> expressed pleasure
                            with the results of the June talks. His colleague, Deputy Secretary of
                            the Ministry of Power Stevenson had said he hoped the talks could be
                            repeated some time in 1964. During the past year US–<gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> policies with respect to petroleum
                            problems in Indonesia, Peru and Ceylon have been closely aligned as a
                            result of the agreed positions reached in June.</p>
                        <p>Turning to <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>, Sir <persName
                                corresp="#p_HSG1">Geoffrey</persName> observed that the organization
                            might break up as a result of the “unholy alliance” of Venezuela,
                            Indonesia and Iraq, but that its demise did not seem likely. <persName

                            together. Necessarily the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> has a

                                agreed that oil was becoming an increasingly important energy source
                                for Europe. It was expected to account for about 50 percent of the
                                total by 1970. (Memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_DRP1"

                            <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> has always regarded Aden as
                            providing military protection to <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            petroleum interests in the Persian Gulf. Although it can be argued that
                            the Arabs cannot drink their oil and must sell it, a cutoff of oil
                            supplies is not what Britain fears. <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>
                            is concerned for the maintenance of the supply of oil at reasonable
                                prices.<note n="4" xml:id="d176fn4">During their 1963 oil meeting,
                                the two sides had concluded that the international oil industry
                                played an essential and effective role in balancing interests and
                                requirements of producers and consumers. “Alternative systems—direct
                                negotiation between blocs of such countries: an international
                                commodity agreement: or a public utility status implying
                                international regulation of the industry—would prejudice the
                                economic continuity of supplies.” (Ibid.)</note> We have always
                            feared Iraq's getting hold of Kuwait. The combined oil production of the
                            two countries and consequent economic influence would make it difficult
                            for other countries, such as Iran, to follow a line independent of other
                                <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> members in dealing with the
                            companies. We dread a confrontation between the companies and the
                            producing governments since this would certainly lead to a
                            government-government confrontation with all the political consequences
                            which this would entail. In this connection, Prime Minister Alam of Iran
                            had told the British Ambassador that in view of the then <gloss
                                target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> impasse, it would not be too
                            difficult to resurrect the Mossadeq spirit in Iran. Because of
                                this,<gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> is inclined to be a little
                            ahead of but in step with the US in matters involving Middle East
                            petroleum. We continue to believe, said Sir <persName corresp="#p_HSG1"
                                >Geoffrey</persName>, that the companies should do the negotiating,
                            but we do not believe that our recent actions in Iran diverged from this
                            policy. <persName corresp="#p_RF1">Rouhani</persName> is a slippery
                            character and he was not reporting fully to his government on the
                            negotiations with the Consortium. We wished to be sure that the Iranian
                            Government knew precisely the state of play of these negotiations. We
                            have a special relationship with the Iranian Government and believe it
                            possible to discuss these matters frankly with Alam. We no longer have
                            this same type of relationship with Kuwait or Qatar. (In a subsequent
                            conversation with Mr. <persName>Blackiston</persName>, Mr.
                                <persName>Brenchley</persName> explained that <gloss
                                target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> reluctance to intervene in Kuwait was
                            not so much a result of the changed <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss>-Kuwait relationship per se, but rather stemmed from the
                            belief that in the first years after full Kuwait independence the
                            Kuwaitis would suspect Britain of attempting to continue its former
                            prerogatives. By leaning backward to avoid pressuring the Kuwaitis <pb
                                n="319" xml:id="pg_319" facs="0349"/>on any issue, <gloss
                                target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> hopes that Kuwait will voluntarily
                            resume asking Britain for advice some years hence.</p>
                        <p>We envisage, said Sir <persName corresp="#p_HSG1">Geoffrey</persName>,
                            that a confrontation on <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> issues
                            might take place in three different ways. 1) We might find ourselves in
                            a position where, despite our wishes, we would have to support the
                            companies. This would have many drawbacks, including the invoking of
                            Arab nationalist sentiments, provide potential for Soviet meddling and
                            create internal political difficulties in the countries concerned.
                            Because of these fears, the Shah was prepared to get out in front in
                            order to avoid enactment of sanctions at the Riyadh <gloss
                                target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> meeting. He, in fact, blocked
                            sanctions against the companies. 2) A confrontation might arise with the
                            Western European consuming governments since our Western allies would
                            not be happy if difficulties over <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>
                            should lead to an interruption in the supply of their principal energy
                            source. 3) A price rise could likewise provoke a Western European
                            consumer combination to oppose <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>.
                            However, we incline to the belief that a rise in prices will come about
                            in any event and the European governments will just have to learn to
                            live with it.</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_HSG1">Geoffrey</persName> said the US and
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Governments should keep closely in
                            touch as in the past as the situation develops.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> asked whether the
                            companies understood the situation in all its aspects. Sir <persName
                                corresp="#p_HSG1">Geoffrey</persName> said that the British
                            companies did understand the situation. The companies do not, however,
                            want to give away money if they can avoid it. The problem is whether
                            they may maintain too firm a position too long.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJD1">Kelly</persName> expressed agreement in
                            principle with everything Sir <persName corresp="#p_HSG1"
                                >Geoffrey</persName> had said. We no longer can brush <gloss
                                target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> under the rug, said he. We are also
                            worried about a consumer-producer confrontation and there is a chance we
                            might provoke this sooner than is necessary. The <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss>, with respect to the <gloss target="#t_OECD1"
                                >OECD</gloss> Oil Committee, is about one-half a step ahead of the
                            U.S. We fear, however, that this is too far ahead for our own joint
                            interests. By focusing European attention now on Middle East oil
                            problems we may stimulate European thinking on an oil consumer grouping
                            to counter <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>, and it was for this
                            reason that we opposed discussions of the dependence of Western Europe
                            on Middle East oil by the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> Oil
                            Committee. We wish to avoid a confrontation between <gloss

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJD1">Kelly</persName> said we are also fearful

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PAB1">Powell</persName> expressed agreement as
                            to the danger of creating two massive blocs (consumer and producer) in

                        <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_HSG1">Geoffrey</persName> said he wished to
                            reaffirm the joint position reached in the June talks on the
                            desirability of maintaining a stance of neutrality and non-recognition
                            of <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>. On the subject of whether
                            future <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> company relations will be
                            bilateral or multilateral, Sir <persName corresp="#p_HSG1"
                                >Geoffrey</persName> said <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> is
                            encouraged by a Kuwait Government letter on this subject which maintains
                            the fiction of company-government rather than company-<gloss
                                target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> negotiations. We greatly fear the
                            multilateral approach but believe we will get by the next stage of
                            discussions without having to face this problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> remarked that the
                            Department has been under pressure to recognize a number of entities,
                            e.g. Palestine and the Arab boycott. Our position has been to deal only
                            with governments and this policy could be extended to <gloss

                        <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_HSG1">Geoffrey</persName> expressed concern
                            about the attitude which <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> Secretary
                            General-elect Bazzaz will take. He characterized Bazzaz as an “extreme

                                >Geoffrey</persName> said the main point which <gloss

                                >IPC</gloss>. We have not informed American shareholders in <gloss

                            interest in Iraqi concessions but have found that through grapevine they
                            know names of most such firms. We have cautioned shareholders against
                            public pronouncement threatening legal action believing this could force
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> into intransigent position which

                            Other producing governments could draw same conclusions and concept of

                            governments would be led to conclude that U.S. companies are not

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> asked if the <gloss
                                target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            negotiations were getting anywhere. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SRC4">Strong</persName> said it was very hard to say
                            because our information was not complete and because it was difficult to
                            judge the real intentions of the two parties. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said we were now in a position
                            where we should press the American <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>
                            shareholders on precisely where the negotiations stand. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_SRC4">Strong</persName> remarked that <gloss
                                target="#t_SOCONY1">Socony</gloss> Mobil representative <persName
                                corresp="#p_MHC1">Henry Moses</persName>, one of the <gloss
                                target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> negotiators, had brought in company
                            lawyers and drafters from New York to join the talks and that this
                            seemed a good sign. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said
                            this might be so but one could never be sure that the arrival of lawyers
                            signified progress. He went on to say that the time was coming fairly
                            soon when representatives of the two companies should be invited down
                            from New York for a discussion. The Department had stood down the
                            independent companies for quite a while now<note n="2" xml:id="d182fn2"
                                >See <ref target="#d181">Document 181</ref>.</note> and yet did not
                            have a clear idea of just how the negotiations were progressing and what
                            the prospects were. We should make clear to Standard of New Jersey and
                                <gloss target="#t_SOCONY1">Socony</gloss> Mobil that we could not
                            hold the line in Iraq forever. While we were prepared to go along for a
                            while yet we could only do this if the companies proceeded diligently
                            with the negotiations and kept us informed of progress and results. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> added that we might
                            consider saying the same things to the British Government as added
                            insurance against intentional holding back by <gloss target="#t_IPC1"
                                >IPC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SRC4">Strong</persName> expressed the
                            view that the Iraqis desired settlement with <gloss target="#t_IPC1"
                                >IPC</gloss> but did not want to appear too anxious since that would
                                <pb n="329" xml:id="pg_329" facs="0359"/>clearly give the company an
                            advantage. He hated to see the negotiations drag on too much longer for
                            as time passed there was increasing danger that Iraq's political
                            instability, together with British and Iranian activity against the
                            present Iraqi Government, might result in a new Iraqi regime less
                            willing and able to reach an agreement than the present Government.
                            While he had no proof, the Ambassador felt almost certain that the
                            British and Iranians were not just hoping for but working toward a
                            change of government in Iraq. Certainly, he said, it was British policy
                            to keep Iraq weak and relatively poor so as to avoid pressure from Iraq
                            on Britain's oil and political position in the Persian Gulf.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJD2">Jernegan</persName> said he was impressed
                            by the importance of the principle the U.S. Government had upheld for
                            many years regarding oil concessions: namely, that oil producing
                            countries should be prevented from making a success out of
                            nationalization or other unilateral actions with respect to oil
                            concessions legally held by foreign companies. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> agreed this was important but said
                            he feared that in the present situation the American companies which
                            heeded the Department's advice to stay out of Iraq might eventually find
                            themselves undercut by other American companies that chiseled. Also
                            there were the Japanese, Italians, and other foreign oil operators to
                            worry about. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJD2">Jernegan</persName> pointed
                            out that the American companies seriously interested in Iraq had in fact
                            done some groundwork and therefore, in the event a foreign company
                            suddenly breached the line there, our companies would be in position to
                            move ahead rapidly and would not be at a serious disadvantage.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SRC4">Strong</persName> suggested that
                            there might not be serious adverse effects on oil company operations
                            outside Iraq in the event the Iraqis got away with their Law 80 action.
                            He thought that if we considered the situation in other countries on a
                            case by case basis we might find that there would not be repercussions
                            elsewhere. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJD2">Jernegan</persName> indicated
                            that he thought there would be repercussions. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EAF2">Ensor</persName> felt that adverse effects were
                            probable, and mentioned Algeria and Indonesia in this connection.</p>
                        <p>With regard to action by the Department, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJD2"
                                >Jernegan</persName> said he was inclined to recommend that the two
                            American <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> shareholders be called to
                            Washington as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> suggested,
                            but that we limit ourselves to telling them that we could not hold the
                            line in Iraq indefinitely and wanted to be absolutely sure that the two
                            companies and their <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> associates were
                            doing everything they possibly could to reach an agreement in Iraq. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said this would be fine
                            but that we should also emphasize to them the real responsibility on
                            their part to move rapidly toward a settlement. In conclusion, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he would speak to
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> and would let
                            NEA know when to proceed with arrangements for the meeting with Standard
                            of N.J. and <gloss target="#t_SOCONY1">Socony</gloss> Mobil.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WR2">Warner</persName> opened the conversation
                            by saying that the Syrian nationalization of the <gloss
                                target="#t_SOCONY1">Socony</gloss> subsidiary was worrisome because
                            of its possible repercussions and precedents elsewhere in the Near East
                            and the world in general where his company has much larger interests. He
                            then requested Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>'s views
                            on how the Syrian nationalization fitted into the current Near Eastern
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> reviewed the situation
                            and motivations of each of the Near Eastern countries in the context of
                            such major developments as the Unified Arab Command, the Arabs' Jordan
                            River diversion activities, the West Germany-UAR confrontation, the
                            growing UAR economic and military difficulties, and US–UAR relations.
                            Among his observations on Syria were the following:</p>
                        <p>The Syrian Government has been taking various extreme actions in an
                            attempt to prop up its shaky regime. Syrians consider themselves as the
                            vanguard of Arabism, and they are out to one-up the Egyptians whenever
                            they can, whether it be in terms of Arab socialization (nationalization)
                            or struggle against the “imperialists.” It should be noted also that the
                            nationalization of the oil marketing companies is but part of a much
                            larger Syrian socialization program that gained new impetus in
                            January.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WR2">Warner</persName> asked Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>'s views on Nasser's possible
                            reactions given the tightening UAR economic situation. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said that Nasser has shown that
                            he can and will lash out when confronted. The UAR is in economic straits
                            and, even though Nasser has received some substantial commitments from
                            Communist countries and possibly also from Kuwait, <pb n="331"
                                xml:id="pg_331" facs="0361"/>it appears that Nasser would like to
                            keep his contacts with the West open. Our problem is to keep Congress
                            from cutting off our contact with the UAR and bringing about a
                            confrontation that would lead to a dangerous polarization in the Near
                            East, with the West and Israel on one side, ranged against the
                            Communists and the Arabs on the other.</p>
                        <p>In parting, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WR2">Warner</persName> told Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> that <gloss
                                target="#t_SOCONY1">Socony</gloss> would make no public denunciation
                            of the Syrian nationalization of its marketing subsidiary and would try,
                            in coordination with ESSO and Shell, to negotiate an acceptable
                            settlement with the Syrian Government. After <gloss target="#t_SOCONY1"
                                >Socony</gloss> has had a chance to see how things are going, he
                            plans to come back for further discussion with Messrs. Mann and
                                <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> respectively.</p>

                        <p>In a memorandum of April 26, 1965, to Assistant Secretary of State for
                            Economic Affairs <persName corresp="#p_SAM4">Anthony Solomon</persName>,
                            Stanley Nehmer discussed the growing dispute between the Departments of
                            State and Interior over control of international oil policy. The
                            immediate cause was a proposed round of Anglo-American oil talks, and
                            the point of contention was whether <persName corresp="#p_SAM4"
                                >Solomon</persName> or Assistant Secretary of the Interior <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJD1">John Kelly</persName> would host the conference.
                            Nehmer commented: “it has seemed almost inevitable that, sooner or
                            later, the line would have to be drawn between oil policy and foreign
                            affairs. If a confrontation is inevitable, it would be difficult to find
                            an issue more likely to be resolved in the Department's favor than one
                            which involves the politics of world oil and has as precedent a series
                            of similar meetings in which leadership by the Department has been a
                            foregone conclusion.” Nehmer noted that the Interior Department was
                            contending that <persName corresp="#p_KJD1">Kelly</persName> had been
                            personally invited to discuss oil matters by the U.K. Minister of Power
                            because the U.K. proposal for the talks had been contained in a letter
                            to <persName corresp="#p_KJD1">Kelly</persName>, but he stressed that
                            the proposed talks were a part of a series, all of which had been held
                            under State's chairmanship. (Department of State, E Files: Lot 69 D 76,
                            PET—Petroleum United Kingdom 1965, US/<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            Oil Talks 1965) Under Secretary of State Mann agreed. (Letter from
                            Nehmer to <persName corresp="#p_AWCJ1">Armstrong</persName>, May 5;
                            ibid.)</p>
                        <p>In a letter to <persName corresp="#p_KJD1">Kelly</persName> on April 28,
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAM4">Solomon</persName> invited him to serve
                            as “vice-chairman” of the talks. (Ibid.) <persName corresp="#p_KJD1"
                                >Kelly</persName> replied on April 30: “As you point out, the talks
                            are part of a series. There has occurred, however, a fundamental change
                            in Interior's responsibilities since the last of these discussions in
                            June 1963. I refer of course, to the President's assignment to the
                            Secretary of the Interior of responsibility for oil policy <pb n="332"
                                xml:id="pg_332" facs="0362"/>within the Executive Branch.” “In the
                            circumstances,” he continued, “I am of the view that it would be
                            appropriate for the senior representative from the Department of the
                            Interior to act as chairman of the U.S. delegation. I would anticipate
                            that the Department of State would provide the vice chairman.”

                            <persName corresp="#p_KJD1">Kelly</persName>'s reference to the
                            President's assignment was to a December 1963 meeting between President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and Secretary of the

                                <persName corresp="#p_USL1">Udall</persName> told the press that the
                            President had put him “in charge of oil policy.” As <persName

                            effect I'm glad to say, to try to horn in on State's role. The fact is
                            pretty clear that both the President and <persName corresp="#p_USL1"
                                >Udall</persName> thought of 'oil policy,' at that time, as purely a

                        <p>Although the talks were scheduled to begin on May 10, 1965, the issue was
                            still unresolved on May 5 when <persName corresp="#p_SAM4"
                                >Solomon</persName> was called away from Washington unexpectedly to
                            deal with the Dominican crisis; in a memorandum of that day, <persName
                                corresp="#p_EAF2">Ensor</persName> referred to <persName
                                corresp="#p_SAM4">Solomon</persName> as the “prospective chairman.”
                            (Ibid., E Files: Lot 69 D 76, PET—Petroleum United Kingdom, US/<gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Oil Talks 1965) In June the Department
                            rescheduled the talks for early July. <persName corresp="#p_KJD1"
                                >Kelly</persName> again refused to serve as vice chairman in a

                            a handwritten note approved by an officer in FSE reads: “In view of
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJD1">Kelly</persName> leaving Interior,
                            should we take the British option of September?” Another note, dated
                            June 30 reads: “No reply. File.” (Ibid.)</p>
                        <p>The Anglo-American Oil Talks eventually were held on November 15, 1965,
                            at the State Department with <persName corresp="#p_MJC1">Cordell

                                >Ensor</persName> later wrote: “Interior used to be always for
                            cutting imports; it is now, genuinely and of its own steam, not
                            restrictive on this subject beyond minutiae… . State, too, used to be
                            what I call 'wishy-washy' free trade on oil issues but has of late grown
                            up a lot. I believe that it is increasingly recognized in State that,
                            even though domestic politics were the cause of our imports policy (and
                            the 'national security' basis was hypocrisy really), it is still a wise
                            policy. This country should not become dependent on regularly receiving
                            large quantities of oil from areas which are even slightly unreliable
                            over the long term (which in my view means everywhere but Canada) and
                            the economic price of this is well worth it.” Foreign and domestic oil
                            policies, he wrote, were increasingly unrelated matters. “What must be
                            borne in mind is that, regardless of the 1963 announcement, the fact
                            remains undisputed and indisputable that State has full practical
                            responsibility for our oil policy abroad. If this is done badly, it is
                            State's fault entirely.” (Memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_FER1"

                        <p>The mutuality of U.S. oil policy objectives shared with the U.K. provides
                            the basis of these talks, which are held roughly every two years, and
                            permits detailed exchange of information and evaluation of specific
                            problems. Because of the brevity of the discussions and their function
                            as a part of a continuing interchange on oil problems, the talks tended
                            to concentrate upon changes in the oil scene—less time was devoted to
                            historical analysis and relatively stable situations.</p>
                        <p>The items discussed included a review of supplies up to 1970, security of
                            supplies, contingency planning, and long-term hedges such as shale oil,
                            tar sands, and liquid hydrocarbons from coal. Relations <pb n="335"
                                xml:id="pg_335" facs="0365"/>with producer countries were discussed
                            with emphasis upon Arab oil policy, and <gloss target="#t_OPEC1"
                                >OPEC</gloss> developments. Individual country problems were
                            reviewed with stress being given to the major producing countries of the
                            Middle East and Africa with Latin American and also Indonesian
                            developments also noted. The situation in the EEC as it affects oil, and
                            the work of the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> in oil and energy
                            generally were subject of exchanges of views, as were the developments
                            in the consuming countries of Europe. There was brief discussion on the
                            problems of oil in India and Pakistan. The discussions concluded with
                            the subject of the financial problems of the industry arising from
                            balance of payments programs, and reduced self-financing capacity of the
                            companies.</p>
                        <p>The highlights of the meetings included the following items:</p>

                        <p>Projections of supplies to 1970 worked out by the Ministry of Power and
                            the Department of Interior in advance of the meetings were quite useful
                            in pointing out differing production and consumption growth rates which
                            will be at the heart of many future problems. Excluding a major
                            disruption, supply will be adequate during this period and in fact
                            problems may arise stemming from conditions of increasing
                            over-supply.</p>

                        <p>The U.K. is distinctly optimistic about the prospects for North Sea gas
                            production. Gas so far discovered is of high quality (98% methane) and
                            the <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss> discovery is confidently expected
                            to be a commercial producer. Two other gas shows, as yet unpublicized,
                            indicate at least the possibility of commercial gas production.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The recent white paper on U.K. fuel policy is the first such document
                            published by <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>. Mr.
                                <persName>Beckett</persName> regarded as significant the statements
                            in the White Paper that undue curtailment of the use of oil could affect
                            the health of the economy generally and that reduced reliance on imports
                            for security or B/P reasons had its limits. The Paper reflects the
                            position that no discrimination would be practical in relation to the
                            Free World sources of crude imports, and while the same policy is to be
                            applied to refined product imports, it would be kept under review. This
                            latter point, Mr. <persName>Beckett</persName> stated, was aimed at the

                        <p>The U.K. anticipates Nigerian production of its highly desirable crude
                            will reach 1 million <gloss target="#t_bd1">b/d</gloss> by 1970. This is
                            a strong upward revision <pb n="336" xml:id="pg_336" facs="0366"/>of
                            previous estimates. Nigerian associated gas production will be high and
                            preliminary studies indicate its landed price in the U.K. may be lower
                            than Algerian gas. Development of Nigerian gas may therefore pose
                            serious policy problems for <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Beckett</persName> indicated that the U.K. may well be

                            importers of crude. Under the present price structure these prices were
                            high, reflecting the traditional pattern of the integrated companies to
                            shift profits to their production accounts.</p>

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> Oil Committee Small Group (also
                            called the High Level Working Party) was fathered by the British.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJA2">Angus Beckett</persName> is the
                            chairman. As one function, the Small Group is to prepare studies
                            centered around the question of the security of Western Europe's
                            imported oil supplies. To date the Small Group has considered a paper
                            prepared by the British outlining the demand-supply outlook for oil and
                            gas from 1965 to 1970–75. It will next examine a British prepared survey
                            of various emergency contingencies, i.e. peacetime situations where oil
                            from one or several major supplying countries is cut off. The Small
                            Group has under revision a tanker transport outlook covering the same
                            period prepared by the U.S. and the Netherlands.</p>
                        <p>The U.K.'s reasons for establishing the Small Group included the
                            objective of influencing the form of common energy policy the EEC would
                            eventually adopt. This objective was reviewed in light of events. While
                            the EEC crisis deprives the Small Group of some of its urgency, both
                            delegations agreed that in view of the greater uncertainty as future
                            Community energy policy it is if anything more important now to continue
                            its work as a means of influencing EEC attitudes. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJA2">Beckett</persName> emphasized the need to keep
                            representation in the Group at an “appropriate” level and urged that the
                            U.S. and U.K. set an example in this regard.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> Oil Committee reorganization
                            proposed by Molkenboer seemed of questionable utility to the U.S. The
                            proposal did not right what was wrong—primarily that the Committee
                            lacked something important to do (with the exception of the Small
                            Group). The proposal would seemingly confuse procedure with
                            substance.</p>
                        <p>The U.K., in contrast, regarded the Oil Committee as having importance
                            apart from any studies it might make. It is a Committee in being which
                            could deal with a supply crisis. The U.K. agreed that there should not
                            be a search for work for the Committee, but feels Molkenboer's proposals
                            deserve some sympathy, partly because it eliminates the <pb n="337"
                                xml:id="pg_337" facs="0367"/>redundancy of having both GWP and
                            Plenary sessions. The proposal would bring other members into more
                            active participation, giving them specific jobs to perform, and thus
                            relieve the U.S. and U.K. of making all the running. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJA2">Beckett</persName> also noted that with the
                            abolition of the Gas Committee its work would be assumed by the Oil
                            Committee. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJA2">Beckett</persName> indicated
                            he had spoken with Molkenboer recently and the latter will develop a
                            modified proposal.</p>

                        <p>Both sides agreed <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> has gained in
                            international status through obtaining objectives on royalty expensing,
                            obtaining recognition by the UN, and in the competence of some of its
                            staff. No change in current U.S. and U.K. policy toward <gloss
                                target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> should now be made. It was thought
                            that the premises of the “neutrality” policy should be reexamined even
                            though this might well produce no change. There was agreement that the
                                <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> prorationing scheme is not
                            likely to succeed, but its failure may lead to much “bad blood” and the
                            plan is based on dangerous principles. There was also the thought that
                            negotiations regarding allowable discounts off posted prices after 1966
                            for the expensing of royalties could present very serious
                            difficulties.</p>

                        <p>Both sides agreed the current situation is characterized by a combination
                            of sizable bonus payments and new kinds of terms. This trend is likely
                            to continue. The British said they were pleased to note that the
                            countries continued ready to let new concessions and no real enthusiasm
                            appears to exist for contracting for oil operations. We noted, however,
                            the trend in the evolution of government oil entities toward integrated
                            export operations. Iran has crude of its own now and Kuwait may soon be
                            in a similar position with refined products. It is hard to foresee how
                            all of this will develop, but it appears downstream operations could
                            prove unprofitable and difficult for them.</p>

                        <p>We expressed concern that labor issues could become one of the most
                            serious problems in the Persian Gulf area. Reluctance of the governments
                            to face this issue and company convictions that the Persian Gulf labor
                            movement is politically motivated per se must be overcome. Otherwise the
                            field would be open to radical politically oriented groups such as the
                            UAR-dominated Arab Federation of Petroleum Workers. Already this appears
                            to have taken place in Kuwait. The British agreed that this was a matter
                            of increasing importance that should be looked at closely. They
                            suggested that it might be well for both sides to discuss it again

                        <p>There was general agreement about the UAR's role, present and future, in
                            oil matters. We pointed out the conflict of interests that exists
                            between the UAR and the Arab oil producing states. There is a limit to
                            which the UAR can squeeze or force these countries, even Iraq. Nasser
                            has gone about as far as he can in this respect. The discovery of oil in
                            the Gulf of Suez by Pan American (eventually production may reach
                            100,000 b/d) could even lead to more responsible UAR attitudes on
                            oil.</p>
                        <p>We mentioned Syria as being perhaps more vociferous than the UAR in
                            hewing to the radical line on oil.</p>
                        <p>We also pointed up our concern over reports that the ideas of Abdullah
                            Tariki still have considerable popular appeal in the Arab world. His
                            influence should not be discounted. In addition, there are others, like
                                <persName corresp="#p_MF1">Faisal Mazidi</persName> in Kuwait, who,
                            while not in favor of immediate nationalization, still advocate eventual
                            government control of the oil industry. In short, we thought we should
                            not be over-confident that these dangers were not real.</p>
                        <p>The British agreed that we should not be overly confident even though
                            there is evidence of growing responsibility in the area on oil

                        <p>The British said the informational efforts of the U.S. and U.K.
                            Governments and the oil companies in the Middle East should not
                            necessarily be directed against the more sophisticated approach of
                                <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>. What requires countering are
                            the wilder, radical Arab views. This is a long-term operation requiring
                            time to prepare and execute.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJA2">Beckett</persName> indicated that
                            extremist propaganda was being countered through a program developed in

                            consultations. The U.S. expressed interest in the outcome of the
                            discussions. Although the form did not seem applicable here because of
                            the multiplicity of interests and companies, there was perhaps real
                            value in the idea of working on the problem in concert with industry. No
                            formal consultation between the U.S. and U.K. seems necessary. We do
                            feel the U.S. companies are doing a good job and we have encouraged them
                            to prepare papers and distribute them in both European and Arab oil

                            are applied in drawing it. The Iranians must now decide one way or
                            another on this. While one set of principles would give Iran the
                            Atlantic strike area, their application would confer upon Abu Dhabi

                        <p>We expressed concern about events in Kuwait, especially political
                            developments affecting the prospects for ratification of the
                            supplemental agreement. We pointed out that unilateral action against
                                <gloss target="#t_KOC1">KOC</gloss> by the National Assembly was a
                            potential possibility. The British, while agreeing that early
                            ratification is unlikely, were somewhat surprised by the possibility of
                            unilateral action. They listened attentively to a description by the
                            U.S. side of political changes in Kuwait (reduced role of the Amir,
                            increased political activity, etc.) which had greatly altered the
                            premises of successfully dealing with the Government). The U.K. tended
                            to agree that changes had indeed occurred and said they would closely
                            examine this question.</p>

                        <p>The British said prospects for larger increases in Abu Dhabi were very
                            good particularly offshore where output could easily reach approximately
                            1,400,000 b/d in the not too distant future. Abu Dhabi offshore could
                            well become one of the largest fields in the Middle East. A 50/50
                            agreement between the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and Abu Dhabi Marine Areas
                            Ltd. will probably be concluded in due course.</p>

                        <p>Though the Franco-Algerian Oil Agreement strengthens the French dirigiste
                            oil policy, it is regarded as sui generis because of the special
                            relationships between Algeria and France. It was agreed that the
                            Agreement could raise problems for U.S. and U.K. companies and these
                            could ultimately require official intervention. The RAP-Saudi Arabian

                        <p>The U.S. representatives outlined the serious effect adoption by the GOL

                            have for the U.S. “independents” producing in Libya. The U.S. concern in
                            respect to the pricing problem in Libya is that the GOL give the
                            independents a full opportunity to be heard so that a mutually agreeable

                            a very marked effect on the returns obtained by the majors on their

                            the European capital market. The required self-financing is restricted
                            by low prices and producing country measures to increase taxation.</p>
                        <p>The widespread exploration activities of the companies will strain

                            estimates of future Iran income. Noted specifically how during last
                            summer's economic review Shah had brushed aside realistic estimates his
                            economic advisors as being too conservative. Also explained this pointed

                            made clear my conviction oil Consortium worked by laws of supply and
                            demand rather than political vindictiveness (<persName>Wright</persName>
                            says he took same line). I also expressed some doubt about plethora of
                            Iranian barter deals with Eastern Bloc countries, noting how Hitler used
                            these tools for political purposes. Also suggested Iran keep wary eye on
                            its oil sales to Rumania and others for possibility exists Eastern Bloc
                            countries will flog this oil on European market at expense Iranian
                            markets. Noted that Iran would do well to keep in mind its predominant
                            oil market (and inconvertible exchange) must inevitably be with free
                            world countries.</p>

                            Saudi Arabia (I noted year ago Iran percentage of increase was high
                            while Saudi was low) and in Abu Dhabi. We both agreed frank <pb n="342"

                                Consortium. He cited 200,000 barrel per day nosedive in liftings in

                                Iran. He went on to say that both military security and economic
                                development are vital to Iran. If oil companies do not provide
                                anticipated growth in revenues, Iran might have to reorient
                                “philosophy” which Shah said he had espoused “during twenty-five

                                and economically progressive Iran. Shah realized companies work for
                                profit and that they have obligations as in Saudi Arabia, but in his
                                view it is in their higher interest to support large progressive

                                shifting Iran's “philosophy,” Shah said he might have no choice. He
                                would have to supply his military and economic development needs
                                where money and cheapest prices available. It was in this connection
                                that he mentioned Soviet MIG–21 sales to Arab countries for only
                                $600,000 per copy. I said from direct experience Iran should keep in

                                oil companies. He agreed nevertheless that healthy Iranian

                        <p>The Country Team welcomes the policy of review of U.S. attitudes towards
                                <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>; and concludes that the

                        </p>
                        <p>The present aloof U.S. attitude toward <gloss target="#t_OPEC1"
                                >OPEC</gloss> is not a lively issue in US-Kuwaiti relations, but we
                            are somewhat at loss to find a locally acceptable theoretical defense of
                            our position and appreciate the opportunity to participate in this
                            policy review.</p>
                        <p>A Kuwaiti advocate of <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> might claim
                            that its mandate rests on the right of a state to exercise commercial
                            regulation of its petroleum reserves and to seek this regulation in an
                            entity transcending state boundaries when the companies controlling its
                            petroleum industry are engaged in “interstate commerce.” He might assert
                            that <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> is not dissimilar from a
                            commodity agreement in which the leading exporters of petroleum,
                            developing nations heavily dependent upon foreign exchange earnings of
                            the commodity, are seeking to improve its international terms of trade.
                            In our own historical experience and present economic policy, we find
                            little theoretical justification for remaining unsympathetic to an
                            organization so founded and motivated.</p>
                        <p>On a more practical level, <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> is
                            ostensibly opposed to the interests of American petroleum companies
                            which the United States <pb n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0375"
                            />Government has a certain obligation to protect. We are insufficiently
                            expert to determine, but we wonder, nevertheless, if certain <gloss
                                target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> objectives—stability in crude
                            production and price and a uniformity in producing-country petroleum
                            laws and concession terms—might not, in the long run, be in the interest
                            of some American oil companies.</p>
                        <p>We wonder if, at some point, the United States itself might not
                            conceivably become a “petroleum exporting country.” We particularly
                            question, as the dust settles in Libya, whether there is one definable
                            “U.S. oil company interest” on which the U.S. Government can afford to
                            hang a petroleum policy. When our oil companies deal with individual
                            producing-country governments, the U.S. Government, through normal
                            diplomatic channels, quite properly maintains a separate identity,
                            permitting us the flexibility to assist in mediating possible disputes
                            and to avoid impairing wider U.S. policy interests in the country
                            concerned. If our petroleum companies accept the reality that, in their
                            multi-national negotiations with the producing countries, they are
                            dealing with <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>, should not the
                            United States Government be in a position to exercise a similar
                            third-party role?</p>
                        <p>We see <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> as a manifestation of a
                            strong historic trend toward economic nationalism in Arab and other
                            developing countries. Like it or not, we have little enough possibility
                            of directing this trend, and even less of opposing it successfully.
                            There are issues on which the U.S. Government must oppose this trend. If
                                <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> is not one of these, we would
                            seem to be borrowing trouble and foregoing a possible opportunity in
                            failing to establish a working relationship with it.</p>
                        <p>Certainly, our oil companies might wish that there were no demand for an
                            organization such as <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>, but <gloss
                                target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> does exist. While <gloss
                                target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>'s viability and reputation for
                            economic statesmanship are by no means assured, the organization does
                            appear to have mellowed with age. In the context of economic
                            nationalism—certainly in the context of Arab nationalism—<gloss
                                target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> may emerge as a force for reason and
                            moderation. In our assessment, American oil companies, in spite of their
                            economic power and technical prowess, are politically and
                            psychologically on the defensive in their dealings with the producing
                            countries. As an offensive alliance, <gloss target="#t_OPEC1"
                                >OPEC</gloss> is a somewhat cumbersome one. By attempting to force
                            the companies to deal with <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>, the
                            producing countries have to reduce their collective objectives to the
                            lowest common denominator. In Kuwait, at the moment, it is, after all,
                            not the Government, but Gulf-<gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss> that is
                            seeking ratification of the “<gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>
                            settlement.” In short, if there were no <gloss target="#t_OPEC1"
                                >OPEC</gloss>, perhaps the companies would have to create one.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>We understand from Kuwaiti oil officials that <gloss target="#t_OPEC1"
                                >OPEC</gloss> is considering shifting its attentions from obtaining
                            larger benefits from international <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346"
                                facs="0376"/>companies to seeking a reduction of consumer country
                            restrictions and tariffs on crude oil. In anticipation of this possible
                            shift of emphasis, the U.S. Government should be in position to deal
                            directly with the organization.</p>
                        <p>Consequently, we think that establishment of a U.S. Government working
                            relationship with <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> would serve U.S.
                            interests. The form such recognition might take raises tactical as well
                            as legal questions. In the Arab world, <gloss target="#t_OPEC1"
                                >OPEC</gloss> is not above suspicion for its “ineffectiveness” in
                            obtaining producing-country demands and because it is subject to
                            “subversive” Iranian and Venezuelan influences. Should the U.S.
                            Government embrace <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> too
                                warmly,<gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>'s credibility as a
                            champion of producing-country aspirations might be further impaired. For
                            this reason, perhaps our approach to <gloss target="#t_OPEC1"
                                >OPEC</gloss> should stress the establishment of a working
                            relationship rather than formal recognition.</p>

                            two resolutions indicating new moves by the member countries to increase
                            their revenues from oil and ultimately to raise prices at which crude
                            oil is sold by concessionnaire companies.</p>
                        <p>Resolution 71 recommends that each member country take steps toward the
                            complete elimination of <pb n="347" xml:id="pg_347" facs="0377"/>the tax
                            free discount off of posted prices permitted the companies. The discount
                            was granted in the <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> settlement of
                            1964 as a quid pro quo to the companies for their agreeing to treat
                            royalty payments to governments as an operating expense instead of as a
                            part of the total tax liability to governments as was the case under the
                            original 50–50 profit sharing formula. The net effect of the tax free
                            discount under the 1964 settlement was to offset in part the amount
                            governments would receive by treating the standard 12.5 percent royalty
                            payment as an operating expense. By the terms of the 1964 agreement,
                            negotiations are to take place this year on the amount of the tax free
                            discount for 1967 and future years. The companies are committed to
                            reduce the discount if market conditions justify a reduction below the
                            6.5 percent rate in effect for 1966.</p>
                        <p>If the <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> membership were to succeed
                            in forcing an immediate elimination of the discount beginning in 1967,
                            total payments to governments would be increased significantly. For
                            Kuwait for example, discontinuance of the discount would result in an
                            increase in payments to the GOK of about $0.05 per barrel of production,
                            or $40 million per year.</p>
                        <p>The producing companies are certain to resist any move by governments to
                            terminate the discount, and the probability is that the best the
                            governments will obtain will be agreement to eliminate the discount
                            gradually over a period of years, at a rate of decrease of perhaps 1
                            percent per year over five years.</p>
                        <p>The important point in respect of this resolution is that altering the
                            percentage discount will require protracted negotiations with the
                            companies. Therefore Resolution 71 should not have an immediate impact
                            upon either government revenues or the cost of crude oil to the
                            companies.</p>
                        <p>Resolution 72 recommends that member countries apply posted or
                            “reference” prices for the purpose of determining the tax liabilities of
                            the oil companies operating in their territories; and that no petroleum
                            rights be granted or contracts entered into concerning exploration or
                            exploitation of new areas unless royalty payments and income tax
                            liabilities are calculated on the basis of posted or reference prices,
                            or unless the share to be obtained by the government is not less
                            favorable than that obtained under existing arrangements based on posted
                            or reference prices.</p>
                        <p>This resolution derives from a resolution taken at the Tenth <gloss
                                target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> conference in December 1965 directing
                            the Economic Commission of the <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> to
                            study the “implications” of applying posted prices for tax purposes. Of
                            significance is the fact that the December 1965 resolution was taken “in
                            pursuance of” a September 1960 resolution which said member countries
                            would require oil companies to maintain stable prices, try to
                            reestablish posted prices at levels prevailing before these were cut (in
                            1958–1959), and assure that oil companies enter into consultations with
                            governments to explain any circumstances they felt required any future
                            price modifications.</p>
                        <p>A posted price system does not now apply in all <gloss target="#t_OPEC1"
                                >OPEC</gloss> member countries. Venezuela and Indonesia compute
                            income liabilities on prices realized on crude sales. In Saudi Arabia,
                                <gloss target="#t_ARAMCO1">ARAMCO</gloss> sales to non-affiliated
                                <pb n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0378"/>companies are taxed at
                            realized prices. The <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> countries
                            have apparently concluded that so long as crude production in some
                            countries is taxed on actual sales realizations the way is open for some
                            companies to grant “excessive” sales discounts off of posted prices
                            which depress the price of crude oil on world markets. If posted prices
                            were the uniform rule in the <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>
                            membership this would have the desirable effect of steadying and
                            stabilizing world crude oil prices.</p>
                        <p>We believe that this resolution will not prove too difficult for the
                                <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> countries to bring into
                            effect. Venezuela is already considering an offer by the oil companies
                            to compute future taxes on a “reference price” basis. Saudi Arabia has
                            raised with <gloss target="#t_ARAMCO1">ARAMCO</gloss> the idea of
                            calculating income from third party sales on posted prices applying to
                            transfers to affiliated companies. Our assessment is influenced by the
                            conviction that most “major” international companies are accustomed to a
                            posted price system and can see some advantage in placing Venezuela and
                            Indonesia on the same basis in that tax disputes and claims for
                            additional tax payments by those countries might be avoided in the
                            future. There is a further attraction to the old line majors to posted
                            prices; it could affect the capability of the “newcomers”
                            internationally to compete with them in major markets. The latter
                            companies do not have anything like the integrated marketing structure
                            of the major companies. The newcomer's ability to sell at discounted
                            prices and be taxed on those prices has assisted their effort to find
                            markets for their production. To the extent that the range of discounts
                            those companies can offer is narrowed by having to compute taxes on
                            posted prices, particularly when posted prices are out of line with
                            market realities, the newcomers will be able to compete less favorably
                            with the majors in the principal international markets.</p>
                        <p>Once a posted price system is in effect throughout <gloss
                                target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>, a logical subsequent move by the
                                <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> countries would be to demand
                            some increase in actual prices posted. Such a move would support the
                            objective stated in the 1960 resolution to obtain a return of posted
                            prices to 1958–1959 levels.</p>
                        <p>Resolutions 71 and 72 have implications for consumer countries. Each
                            amounts to an increase in real costs of crude oil to the companies which
                            will be reflected in prices offered consumers. The range of discounts
                            off of posted prices companies are willing to absorb as a cost of doing
                            business is narrowed in either case, and increases of the real costs of
                            crude to the producer will be passed on to the buyer.</p>
                        <p>The Eleventh Conference also adopted a non-specific resolution on future
                            production programming within the <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>
                            membership, although at a prior meeting this year <gloss
                                target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> had announced that a decision had
                            been made to “go into the second period of the joint production
                            program.” The resolution refers to “unsatisfactory” rate of <pb n="349"
                                xml:id="pg_349" facs="0379"/>production increase in “certain” member
                            countries, and attributes this condition to “manipulation” of production
                            by companies. It warns that all members will give full support of
                            efforts by those countries “to safeguard their legitimate natural
                            national interests” should their “rates of growth not be improved to
                            satisfactory levels during the year 1966.”</p>
                        <p>This last resolution probably is another case of producer countries using
                            the <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> as the “bogey man” so to speak
                            in pressuring companies to meet their demands. Nevertheless it is an
                            indication of the concern some members have with the levels of
                            production, and is an important resolution to keep in mind when
                            discussing proposals such as <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>'s to
                            return a substantial part of foreign procurement of products to the
                            United States.</p>

                                said at London yesterday Consortium had “asked” for month to give
                                matter further study. Shah readily agreed but he hoped by end of
                                month <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would receive forthcoming
                                response.</item>

                            <item>Shah stressed usual theme that Western oil companies and govts
                                fail to appreciate role Iran can and must play in this region. While
                                companies deny Iran 17 percent increase, Saudi liftings were up 26
                                percent last year and will be so again this year. Shah added that he
                                does not object to high Saudi increase since Faisal is investing
                                money wisely in economic development and also is required to build
                                up military security. What is irritating, Shah said, is large
                                offtake from places like Kuwait and Abu Dhabi with small populations
                                and even Libya with its 2,000,000.</item>

                            <item>I assured Shah oil companies been very sympathetic to Iran's
                                problems, and been trying to do their best. They have, however,
                                problems <pb n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0380"/>and commitments
                                elsewhere which cannot be ignored, and their markets are limited. An
                                annual influx to Iran nearing $600,000,000 from the Consortium
                                convinces me, I said, that Consortium treating Iran very well.
                                Saying it not necessary to make speeches re what happened in
                                    1951,<note n="3" xml:id="d191fn3">Prime Minister Mohammad
                                    Mosadeq nationalized Iranian oil production in 1951, resulting
                                    in an embargo on Iranian oil. Mosadeq's government fell in
                                    1953.</note> I noted Iran would probably be even better off
                                today had it not on that occasion fomented confrontation with oil
                                companies. While implying he expected no similar impasse this time,
                                Shah quickly, though bit lamely, said Consortium should know that if
                                companies suspend production this time other Mideast producing
                                countries would stand by Iran. In any case, he said, such calamity
                                here would affect stability of whole Gulf area, a result which would
                                harm oil companies as well as Iran.</item>

                            <item>I expressed gratification for his intention to avoid disastrous
                                show-down. Making clear I not spokesman for companies, I said it
                                behooves reasonable men in situations of this kind to sit down and
                                determine what is possible and realistic. Shah emphatically agreed.
                                I went on to express view that a main consideration is to avoid
                                setting precedent which other Mideast countries will follow. Such
                                “escalation” I said can in end only harm achievement of Shah's
                                objectives. Shah agreed with this thesis also.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>First step, I told Shah, is definition of problem. In this
                                connection we been a bit confused by impression gleaned in London
                                talks of immediate financial need and by <persName corresp="#p_HAA1"
                                    >Hoveyda</persName>'s indicating this not true. Shah said chief
                                problem is financing Iran's upcoming five-year plan. <gloss
                                    target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> realizes, he said, that 12 percent
                                growth rate of last year cannot be maintained. However, 8–10 percent
                                growth rate is necessary to achieve level of investment needed to
                                reach 8–10 percent rate Iran's economists have determined annual 17
                                percent increase in income from Consortium is required. Since
                                Consortium keeps saying that 12 percent is highest figure possible,
                                way must be found to fill 5 percent gap. Thus <gloss

                                Romanian-Iranian cooperation both re tractors and oil. Just
                                yesterday, he said, Soviets made approach to Iran (he declined to be
                                specific when I asked how serious was the approach) to purchase oil
                                from Iran. Shah <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0381"/>speculates
                                that Soviets want Iranian oil so that they can maintain their
                                monopoly on Romanian oil imports. Shah said Soviets been selling oil
                                at $3.00 per barrel to satellites, whereas highest price at which
                                    <gloss target="#t_NIOC1">NIOC</gloss> been able to sell is $1.35
                                except <gloss target="#t_NIOC1">NIOC</gloss>'s transactions with
                                Consortium which are at $1.84. When I speculated that both Soviets
                                and Romanians might have in mind importing Iranian crude and
                                exporting at least some refined products to markets now served by
                                Consortium, Shah expressed skepticism but agreed it is worth looking
                                into. I tried to pin Shah down whether Iran already has specific
                                deal with Romanians or other East Bloc countries. Shah gave no
                                affirmative indication. We did, however, do some arithmetic which
                                showed that 5 percent of present Consortium production would mean
                                100,000 barrels per day. Shah wanted this translated to tons per
                                year which came out to nearly 6,000,000 tons. Shah gave distinct
                                impression this more than Iran needs for East Bloc, at least for
                                foreseeable future. He mentioned only Romania and Poland as
                                prospective buyers. (Incidentally, PriMin <persName

                            <item>At end of one and one-half hour discussion of number of subjects,
                                Shah returned to oil question. We reviewed Iran's position as giving
                                Consortium any one of three options: a) advance payments; b) cost
                                oil for East Europe; c) some relinquishment.</item>

                                London yesterday took pressure off this discussion. Shah was cordial
                                and seemingly reasonable. Apparent lack of specifics re any of three
                                options is hopeful sign. Also there is some hope that third course
                                may not be necessary if adequate response forthcoming on either of
                                first two courses. Our impression is that first course is
                                unacceptable to companies for precedent and other reasons. While we
                                cannot guarantee that question of relinquishment will not arise, it

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Rockwell</persName>, expressing the hope that our two
                            governments could present a united front, stressed that the Iranians are
                            always quick to perceive differences in our points of view. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFWJ1">Morris</persName> replied that <gloss
                                target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> would see the problems in the same way
                            as the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> insofar as possible and he
                            looked upon the day's task as of finding how and where our two
                            governments differ. He recalled that the importance of Iran to <gloss
                                target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> came out strongly in the Defense
                            Review. It had been clear that Britain could not give up its obligations
                            in the area of Iran and the Gulf despite economic pressures to do so.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MFWJ1">Morris</persName> thought that the job
                            of keeping Iran on its promising course as long as possible was worth
                            quite a lot of effort. In commercial terms the Consortium companies were
                            now in a strong position. In the longer term, he thought, we both could
                            only be the losers in the event of a confrontation, apart from the ill
                            effects that Iran itself might suffer. He did not question the doctrine
                            of leaving the companies to settle their affairs with the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> but he saw the present situation as one
                            in which the companies would appreciate and would need advice from their
                            governments. Mr. <persName>Rockwell</persName> remarked that while we in
                            the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> consult regularly with the U.S.
                            companies, the companies at this time were showing no more disposition
                            than usual to ask our advice.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MFWJ1">Morris</persName>' analysis of Iranian
                            motives centered around the role of the Shah himself who was
                            master-minding the Iranian effort. While there was a certain logic in
                            the shifting economic arguments put forward by Iran, essentially what
                            they want is more money. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MFWJ1"
                                >Morris</persName> cited an additional psychological factor
                            influencing the Shah, namely that Mossadeq was still figuratively
                            pointing a finger at the Shah and HIM felt an urgent need to display
                            “independence.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Rockwell</persName> agreed that the Shah was calling the
                            turns for Iran and added that the aim of getting a marketing role for
                            the <gloss target="#t_NIOC1">NIOC</gloss> figured in Iranian
                            calculations. He also mentioned the Iranian feeling that the Consortium
                            agreement somehow deprived Iran of its sovereignty. There was also a
                            feeling of envy at the disproportionate income from oil enjoyed by
                            neighboring states. The American companies, he believed, seemed to
                            regard the present problem as a continuation of a general dilemma faced
                            by oil companies in other areas as well.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FJT1">Fearnley</persName> added that the
                            companies seemed to take the problem seriously for its own sake. The
                            British companies were looking for a formula to control the eventual
                            erosion of their position in Iran rather than accept “an imposed
                            erosion.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MFWJ1">Morris</persName> called attention to
                            the draft minute on the Iranian economic situation which had been given
                            to the Department on a rush basis. Mr. <persName>Rockwell</persName>
                            distributed a companion U.S. memorandum on the Iranian economic
                            position. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MFWJ1">Morris</persName> noted that
                            Iran does have a foreign exchange problem which will be especially acute
                            next year. He recalled that the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            Ambassadors in Tehran were trying to <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356"
                                facs="0386"/>persuade the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to get
                            an expert to identify the problem; he suggested that we continue to put
                            this idea to the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, apart from the
                            Consortium problem. Mr. <persName>Rockwell</persName> agreed that there
                            was a foreign exchange problem but noted that Iran does have
                            considerable capacity to incur medium and long-term debts. He added that
                            the improved economic management performance by such agencies as the
                            Ministry of Economy and the Central Bank made us more optimistic about
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'s ability to control inflation
                            and otherwise to manage its economic planning. Mr.
                                <persName>Eliot</persName> called attention to the annual IMF
                            consultation in December which should also be helpful.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MFWJ1">Morris</persName>, in considering US and
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> strategic interests in Iran, saw
                            no persuasive alternative to the present regime. He felt that if the
                            Shah could be dissuaded from taking suicidal action in the Consortium
                            affair, Iran showed great promise. Britain, he emphasized, continued to
                            depend heavily on over-flight privileges in Turkey and Iran.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Rockwell</persName> responded that the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> attached equal if not more importance
                            to Iran than the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. In an area beset by
                            nationalist irritations, the Shah's conduct was one element that could
                            be counted on and we find that we have to put up with a great deal to
                            keep the Shah in a reasonably reasonable mood. Mr.
                                <persName>Rockwell</persName> went on to cite the Iranian
                            apprehensions over the prospect of British withdrawal from the Persian
                            Gulf area.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MFWJ1">Morris</persName> related that Foreign
                            Secretary Brown had discussed this subject with Mr.
                                <persName>Aram</persName> in New York recently, at which time Mr.
                                <persName>Brown</persName> reiterated <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> intentions to maintain military dispositions in the area
                            for the foreseeable future. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MFWJ1"
                                >Morris</persName> recalled that the Foreign Secretary had written a
                            personal letter of reassurance to the Shah while the latter was in
                            Austria, noting that the Shah's initial reaction to the letter had been
                            good but that later on HIM had displayed some disquiet. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MFWJ1">Morris</persName> predicted that the Shah must
                            reconcile himself to not getting sovereignty over the other shore of the
                            Gulf. The Shah could, however, take some satisfaction in having the
                            biggest “fleet” in the area.</p>
                        <p>The remainder of the conversation was focused on the risk of unilateral
                            action by the Shah. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MFWJ1">Morris</persName>
                            dismissed the thesis that the Shah might be bluffing and predicted that
                            even if Iran had to retreat altogether from its present position
                            vis-à-vis the Consortium, the Shah would harbor so much rancor that he
                            would be very difficult to deal with in the future. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MFWJ1">Morris</persName> thought the most likely form
                            that unilateral action might take would be legislation designed to take
                            away part of the concessions, perhaps one or more of the producing
                            areas. The Shah seemed to think that the Consortium would go on
                            producing even while accepting a fait accompli.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Rockwell</persName> agreed that if Iran decided to take
                            over any of the producing areas, the crisis would take on really serious
                            proportions. <pb n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0387"/>It was not our
                            impression however that the Shah was ready to wreck the 1954 Agreement.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MFWJ1">Morris</persName> thought that,
                            although such was not the Shah's intention, the danger lay in the
                            possibility that the Shah might set in motion a course of events that he
                            could not stop. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MFWJ1">Morris</persName>
                            agreed that the Shah was unlikely to pursue such a course knowingly, but
                                <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> felt that we must take seriously
                            the possibility that the Shah might try to out-Mossadeq Mossadeq. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFWJ1">Morris</persName> wondered what were
                            the less drastic possibilities of unilateral action. Mr.
                                <persName>Rockwell</persName> thought that it depended on how much
                            the Consortium could absorb. He added that the companies must be the
                            judges of what would be considered drastic and they obviously must make
                            some proposal which the Iranians would not feel that they had to reject
                            out of hand. The companies' proposal would need to offer some meaningful
                            financial result for the Shah in order to register other than a negative
                            impact. Mr. <persName>Rockwell</persName> added that the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> took no position on what the companies'
                            proposals should be.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FJT1">Fearnley</persName> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MFWJ1">Morris</persName> felt that the British companies
                            did not want a showdown. They had a public relations problem, not
                            wanting to appear to be “grinding the faces of the poor.” British
                            Petroleum was seeking to find a formulation that would appear to the
                            layman as just, reasonable and fair. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MFWJ1"
                                >Morris</persName> expressed the hope that the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would point out to the US companies the
                            probable consequences of provoking unilateral action by Iran.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Rockwell</persName> noted that we had already spoken in
                            general terms with the companies and would do so again; he was confident
                            that the US companies were aware of the seriousness of the situation.
                            The Department had told the American companies that we did not want to
                            be involved in the substance of negotiations. We were satisfied that the
                            companies were mindful of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> interest
                            in the problem and that the companies were resolved to seek a way out of
                            the impasse that would not damage their basic interests.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MFWJ1">Morris</persName> agreed that the
                            situation does not call for consideration of additional US or <gloss

                            understood this. He observed that the difference between the evaluations
                            of <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> had to do with the probability rather than the
                            consequences of unilateral action by the Shah. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FJT1">Fearnley</persName> asked whether, if the

                            would exclude the possibility of speaking in general terms about the
                            seriousness of the situation and urge the companies to get their heads
                            together. Mr. <persName>Rockwell</persName> responded that we did not
                            exclude anything; if the companies were to ask our advice we would give
                            it and they could accept or reject it.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of the talks, it was agreed that the two governments
                            would inform the companies of the fact that the talks had taken place in
                            the State Department and would ask the companies to regard this as

                                    xml:id="d196fn3">Syria had few oil resources of its own, but a
                                    pipeline of the Iraq Petroleum Company traversed Syrian
                                    territory, feeding Syrian refineries and carrying oil to the
                                    Mediterranean with an additional fee payable to the government.
                                    At this time, Syria was seeking an increase in the transit fees
                                    and a retroactive increase covering the past decade, which was
                                    unacceptable to the oil companies. Iraq, involved in its own
                                    protracted oil negotiations, wanted to support Syria, but a
                                    shutdown meant a significant loss of revenue since the pipeline
                                    carried two-thirds of Iraq's oil output. Syria broke off
                                    negotiations with the company on November 23, and on November 28
                                    the Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister asked the oil company to “be
                                    generous with Syria.” The company representative said that
                                        “<gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> had been generous with
                                    Syria. Danner said that <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> had
                                    been as generous as possible. Could give no more: to do so would

                                negotiations, that Egyptians have been studying possibilities
                                marketing their own oil and not relying on foreign companies. His

                                may have been wishful thinking on Abdul Aziz's part. In this
                                connection Abdul Aziz said it not true Soviets have excess of oil.

                        <p>In the last week the developments in the Iraq Petroleum Company crisis
                            have succeeded each other rapidly. Early last week Iraqi Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_TN1">Talib</persName>, fully aware that his
                            country is losing $630,000 a day as a result of the oil dispute,
                            broadcast a vaguely-worded warning to the Iraq Petroleum Company to
                            arrange at all costs to have the oil start flowing across Syria again by
                            January 26. The alternative threat implied by the warning was not
                            specified. However, there had been enough loose talk of seizure or
                            nationalization of some parts of <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>
                            concession areas in Iraq to alarm the American partners, who expressed
                            their concern to the Department.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TN1">Talib</persName> had
                            summoned our Ambassador and requested the US Government to influence the
                            American share-holders of <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> in favor
                            of a quick settlement with Syria in order to extricate Iraq from its
                            present political and economic predicament. On the 26th our Ambassador
                            under instructions urged <persName corresp="#p_TN1">Talib</persName> to
                            think before undertaking rash or irrevocable actions against <gloss
                                target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> and urged the Iraqi Government to
                            support its own concessionary company against Syria.</p>
                        <p>The Syrians, who may have begun to suffer from the joint squeeze of (1) a
                            dwindling supply of the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> crude oil on
                            which their refinery primarily depends and (2) a loss of transit
                            revenues of over $2 million a month, then conveyed to the Iraqis their
                            willingness to resume negotiating discussions with <gloss
                                target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> on the basis of a new draft agreement
                            rather than a unilateral Syrian Government decree. The key issue as to
                            whether the Syrians will accept arbitration of Syrian claims for
                            retroactive payments, which might amount to over $100 million, was not
                            made clear in the Iraqi version of the Syrian counter-proposal which was
                            given to <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> the 26th. However the first

                            contact with the Syrians so as to attempt to settle the crisis.</p>
                        <p>However, when <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> on the 30th received
                            the specifics of the Syrian proposal, all of the partners including the
                            French unanimously rejected the new proposal because it would not give
                                <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> enough protection on the
                            retroactive payments issue. If it accepted the Syrian proposal, <gloss
                                target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> would in effect be admitting liability
                            to retroactive payments back to 1955. The issue would accordingly be not
                            whether <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> was liable for retroactive
                            payments, but what the extent of the liability was. <gloss
                                target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> therefore requested its representative
                            in Damascus to seek further clarification of the Syrian proposal, but
                            make clear that <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> cannot agree to make
                            any automatic payments on retroactive claims.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Dean</persName> said he had been
                            instructed by the Foreign Secretary to speak to Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> about Iranian oil production. The
                            Foreign Secretary was very encouraged by the degree of Anglo-American
                            cooperation in resolving the dispute last year between the Iranian Oil
                            Consortium and the National Iranian Oil Company, and although the Shah
                            was not restive at this moment, there could be further trouble between
                            the Consortium and Iran about the volume of oil exports. The Shah could
                            be expected to react critically if the rate of production in Saudi
                            Arabia should continue to be substantially larger than the growth in
                            Iran. Once he is dissatisfied with the Consortium the consequences might
                            be serious for U.S. and U.K. interests. While the Foreign Secretary
                            fully appreciated the relative position of Middle East countries in oil
                            production involves issues of commercial judgment and policy, the
                            Foreign Secretary nevertheless considered it very important that all the
                            oil companies involved should appreciate the need in making their
                            commercial judgments to take into account wider political
                            considerations. The Foreign Secretary stressed this particular point to
                            the British companies during last year's dispute and would speak to them
                            again on the same line if necessary. The Foreign Secretary very much
                            hoped that should it become necessary, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> might see his way clear to speak to
                            the U.S. oil companies and emphasize the need for them to take wider and
                            longer term considerations into account with a view to improving
                            prospects for Consortium production. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD3">Dean</persName> commented that a particular
                            difficulty is that the American-owned <gloss target="#t_ARAMCO1"
                                >Aramco</gloss> has fewer member companies than the Consortium in
                            Iran and is of greater importance to the owner companies than their
                            holdings in the Consortium, but at the same time the <gloss
                                target="#t_ARAMCO1">Aramco</gloss> member companies carry such
                            weight within the Consortium as to be able to determine the Consortium's
                            policies, at least in a negative way.</p>

                            influence of the <gloss target="#t_ARAMCO1">Aramco</gloss> membership
                            within the Consortium to specific comments by the Foreign Secretary as
                            to ways the American companies could influence an increase in Consortium
                            production, i.e. increase their own liftings, and by agreeing to a more
                            flexible over-lift arrangement for all members of the Consortium. The
                            Ambassador did not mention these ways for the U.S. companies to be
                            helpful within the Consortium. He made his presentation one of urging
                            the Secretary to insure that the U.S. participants met fully their
                            obligations under the 1967 crude export program. End FYI.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary inquired whether the Consortium had committed itself to a
                            specific percentage rate of growth for 1967 and was informed <pb n="375"
                                xml:id="pg_375" facs="0405"/>that the Consortium as a matter of
                            practice does not commit itself to a specific percentage rate of growth.
                            However, for 1967 and 1968 the Consortium had in fact told the Iranians
                            what exports would be on a volume basis which worked out for 1967 to a
                            percentage rate of growth of about 13%. The Secretary commented to
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Dean</persName> that he assumed
                            the Foreign Secretary did not refer to the “windfall” increase Iran and
                            other Middle East countries had obtained as a consequence of the
                                Syria-<gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> dispute when he spoke of
                            increases in Iranian production and exports. The Ambassador confirmed
                            that the temporary benefits arising out of the <gloss target="#t_IPC1"
                                >IPC</gloss> case were not a part of the Foreign Secretary's
                            presentation. The Secretary said the Department would consider the
                            matter.</p>

                            our post mortem with the Consortium fellows at the Residence last night.
                            A summation is going in today. You will note the overlifting agreement
                            bugaboo did not come up.</p>
                        <p>Quite clearly my respected British colleague here, in league with Walter
                            Levy, is determined to beef up the secret overlifting agreement into a
                            major issue. You may recall he pushed this matter strongly last fall
                            during the Consortium crisis.<note n="3" xml:id="d204fn3">As <persName
                                    corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> reported on November 10,
                                1966: “In talks with Amb. Wright and me Levy stressed his
                                long-standing anxiety re secret arrangement of Consortium members
                                which in his view tends to keep total annual program for Iranian
                                offtake at lower figure than desirable and which discourages
                                oil-short companies like Shell from taking additional quantities
                                they would otherwise take. Levy is thoroughly convinced that if this
                                secret arrangement ever becomes known to Iranians it will
                                precipitate explosion because of sensitive political implication
                                that Iran's welfare is decided by self-interested foreign oil moguls
                                behind closed doors.” (Telegram 2090 from Tehran, November 10, 1966;

                            acceptable. What I am trying to say, is that Iran is only interested in
                            results, not in formulas utilized in their attainment.<note n="4"

                                British Ambassador to Iran.</note> really has a thing about that
                            overlifting agreement. Obviously he pressed London to send Sir <persName
                                corresp="#p_WPRH1">Patrick</persName> in to see the Secretary. It
                            fits in, incidentally, with several recent evidences that Denis is
                            making real headway with his thesis, which has almost become a fixation,
                            that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> should put all its Mideast
                            chips on the Shah.</p>
                        <p>For example, I noted that when our Bahrein memorandum was presented to
                            the Sheikh, the reporting telegram told of British reluctance to take
                            certain steps because <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>'s Ambassador
                            in Tehran does not want anything to disturb the Shah. Similarly, when
                            Luke Battle and I chatted briefly with Denis at Alam's dinner for the
                            Consortium representatives, Denis again made crystal clear that as far
                            as he and his country are concerned all interest is centered in keeping
                            the Shah happy.</p>
                        <p>With this background, the worrisome thing is that Sir <persName
                                corresp="#p_WPRH1">Patrick</persName>'s approach may presage later
                            efforts by our British cousins to blame the American companies if there
                            is any Iranian disappointment re crude liftings here. I remain convinced
                            that the agreement per se will not be a major issue, unless the British
                            build it up to be one. If they do so they will expect to improve their
                            stock here at our expense.</p>
                        <p>The opportunity to do so can come earlier than we might think. From
                            telegrams to and from Baghdad, I sense widespread interest in making up
                            to the Iraqis for the three months' reduction in their production.<note

                                through Syria by mid-March. (Department of State, E Files: Lot 71 D

                            done at the expense of Iran and other Gulf producers. As our telegram
                            reports, the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> partners are already
                            anticipating this. The best we could get out of the Consortium group was
                            clear assurance that they would stand by their commitment of last fall
                            re liftings for this calendar year, i.e. 675–685 million barrels. The
                            excess liftings, due to the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>-Syria
                            crisis, which brought production up to around 2.6 million bpd, may not
                            be an extra windfall beyond the 1967 commitment. On this point we may
                            see some reaction from the Iranians.</p>
                        <p>While we do not deny that there may be troubles ahead, the alarm bell
                            sounded by Sir <persName corresp="#p_WPRH1">Patrick</persName> was at
                            least a bit premature and certainly out of tune with the harmony which

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAM4">Solomon</persName> stated that the
                            Department had looked carefully into the questions which had been raised
                            recently with the Secretary by Sir <persName>Patrick Dean</persName> and
                            said that according to every indication we had the Consortium would meet
                            its target in 1967 exports. No significant areas of dissatisfaction
                            arose in the recent talks which the Consortium representatives had with
                            the Iranians in Tehran and it did not seem to us, therefore, that there
                            was any need for the U.S. Government to intercede with the American
                            companies and bring political considerations to their attention at this
                            time while things are going well.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the Ambassador's second point on the overlifting
                            arrangement, we understand that the member companies of the Consortium
                            are discussing this question at the present time, including possible
                            ways of modifying this arrangement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAM4"
                                >Solomon</persName> added that he wished to mention in confidence to
                            Sir <persName>Michael</persName> that he himself had taken the
                            opportunity of mentioning this subject with one or more U.S. members and
                            had indicated that we thought it would probably be advisable to modify
                            this arrangement if the companies could see their way clear to do so. He
                            added that while we do not attach the same importance to this matter as
                            some others (for example, Walter Levy), at the same time we recognize it
                            is conceivable that this arrangement could serve as a pretext for
                            dissatisfaction which the Iranians might feel with regard to the
                            Consortium's overall performance. Since the situation is reasonably
                            satisfactory, however, we would not wish to intercede with the U.S.
                            companies now on political grounds even though we would, of course, wish
                            to stay in touch with the British <pb n="378" xml:id="pg_378"
                                facs="0408"/>Government and continue our exchange of views on these
                            matters. This, therefore, was our official answer to Sir
                                <persName>Patrick Dean</persName>'s approach to the Secretary.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAM4">Solomon</persName> added that he would
                            like to raise a question personally, that is, he would like to know why
                            the British Government was as concerned as it seemed to be about this
                            situation at the present time. He would like to know why there was so
                            much emphasis on the question of exports from Iran, particularly now
                            that matters had been settled between the Consortium and the Iranians,
                            when at the same time there is room for concern over the situation in
                            Kuwait and Iraq, where the British also had extensive interests. Was it
                            because the British Government considered the oil issue in Iran so
                            politically explosive? Sir <persName>Michael</persName> replied yes,
                            this was the answer. It was a matter of the importance of Iran to his
                            Government as well as the fact they believed Iran was also significant
                            for the U.S., although they recognized there were some differences in
                            our viewpoint. He added that the purpose of Sir <persName>Patrick
                                Dean</persName>'s conversations with the Secretary was really to
                            draw attention to the risk of a certain political unawareness on the
                            part of some members of the Consortium. His Government wanted to make
                            certain that this factor was taken into account well before a crisis
                            arises again, if this should happen.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAM4">Solomon</persName> replied that as a
                            matter of tactics it was certainly important that we all be aware of
                            these political factors. It was equally important that we not give any
                            impression to the Iranians that we and the British view things
                            differently. Nonetheless, it is our belief that the Consortium's
                            promises will be kept and that there is no reason for stirring things up
                            at this time. Sir <persName>Michael</persName> declared that his
                            Government of course had no desire to add any element of instability to
                            the situation and he wished to give absolute assurances that our talks
                            were not meant to lead at any time to a three-party conversation. It was
                            the Foreign Secretary's feeling however that the political factors
                            should be taken into account at this time. Sir
                                <persName>Michael</persName> said he would, of course, report the
                            U.S. Government's full views on the situation and added that although
                            they had no evidence which we did not also have, it was his personal
                            judgment that in taking note of the U.S. Government's viewpoint, the
                            Foreign Secretary might nonetheless reopen the question if in his
                            judgment this was necessary.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, Sir <persName>Michael</persName> re-emphasized that the
                            U.S. Government need have no fear that the Shah would get any
                            encouragement from his Government to raise a problem which we both hope
                            to avoid.</p>

                        <p>The June 1967 Six-Day War and the concomitant oil embargo disrupted the
                            equilibrium achieved in the early part of 1967 by the oil companies and
                            the producer governments; see <ref target="#d228">Documents 228</ref>
                            ff. The major contractual issue still to be resolved on the eve of the
                            war was the dispute between the Government of Iraq and the <gloss
                                target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> over the 99.6 percent of the <gloss

                            control. The oil company wanted to be able to choose the 0.5 percent it
                            would still control. In May Iraqi President Arif assumed the Prime
                            Ministry, replacing Naji <persName corresp="#p_TN1">Talib</persName>,
                            and appointed a moderate Cabinet without strong Nasserites and active
                            Baathis. An FSE item for a May 12 report to <persName corresp="#p_KNB1"
                                >Katzenbach</persName> noted: “Unless Arif feels that he must defend
                            himself against potential Syrian and Egyptian propaganda attacks by
                            exceeding both countries in socialism and xenophobia, the chances of a
                            revival of the private sector of Iraq's economy and a settlement of its
                            dispute with <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> are greatly enhanced.”

                        <p>Iraqi Law 80 of December, 1961 deprived <gloss target="#t_IPC1"
                                >IPC</gloss> of about 99.6 percent of its concession area. It
                            provided, however, that about 0.5 percent could be returned to the
                            company. <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> has tried to get the right
                            to choose which parcels of land would be included in this crucial
                            half-percent. It especially wanted the proven reserves in the south—the
                            north Rumaila field—to be returned to the company and it has stated
                            repeatedly that any agreement with Iraq on increased production or
                            exports would have to include the return of this field to the company.

                        <p>In spring of this year when Iraq was financially pressed as a result of
                            the closing of the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> line by the
                            Syrians, the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> negotiated a loan from
                            the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> and the company hoped that the

                            with the company settling all outstanding issues, including substantial
                            additional payments to Iraq and the return of the North Rumaila field to
                            the company. A loan was given but in spite of varied attempts no
                            settlement was reached.</p>
                        <p>With the outbreak of hostilities between the Arabs and Israel in June
                            1967 it became highly improbable that a settlement could ever be
                            reached. On August 7, 1967 the Iraqis published a decree Law 97 (it has
                            not, apparently, yet been published in the official gazette) which ended
                            finally <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>'s hope of settlement and

                        <p>After the promulgation of Law 97 in August 1967, the four countries (the
                            United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Netherlands) which
                            represented the Iraq Petroleum Company's shareholders had to decide the
                            nature of the protest to be delivered to the Iraqi Government. The
                            decision was complicated because the oil company partners were
                            incorporated in four different countries and the interests of the
                            governments were not identical. Time was also of the essence, because
                            other countries and independent U.S. companies were interested in
                            gaining access to Iraq's oil resources. During a meeting with the
                            American partners, Mobil and Standard Oil of New Jersey, on August 17,
                            “Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHC1">Moses</persName> stated that he has
                            reports from Baghdad that <gloss target="#t_ENI1">ENI</gloss>, Sinclair,
                            Japanese, Spanish, and Bulgarians have been in contact with <gloss
                                target="#t_NIOC1">NIOC</gloss>.” Deputy Assistant Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> informed the oil
                            company executives that the Department would be coordinating its actions
                            with the British, and that “With a coordinated approach we may be able
                            to persuade the French Government to protest also; the Dutch should be
                            agreeable.” (Memorandum of conversation, August 17; National Archives
                            and Records Administration, RG 59, Records of the Department of State,
                            Central Files, 1967–69, PET 6 IRAQ)</p>
                        <p>Concerted Western action, however, was difficult to achieve. In a meeting
                            on August 22, a British Embassy official explained that “the Dutch are
                            reluctant to make a protest on the ground that they need Iraqi oil and
                            do not want their supply cut off… . Mr. <persName>Urwick</persName> also
                            reported that the French Foreign Ministry desk level reaction to a
                            protest was negative. He was doubtful that the reaction at higher levels
                            would be more favorable.” (Memorandum of conversation, August 22; ibid.,
                            PET 5 IRAQ)</p>
                        <p>At another meeting 2 days later among U.S. officials including Assistant
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SAM4">Solomon</persName>, British
                            Embassy officials, and representatives of Mobil and Standard-NJ, it was
                            decided that a protest was not advisable. A British official noted:
                            “Such protest would serve to point out the difference among the four
                            governments and might give the impression of the Americans and British
                            'ganging up' on the Iraqis. Therefore, the British Government doubts
                            that such protests would be wise and proposes instead to submit a
                            protest on behalf of <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>, as a British
                            incorporated firm, but not on behalf of the British shareholder.”
                            (Memorandum of conversation, August 24; ibid.)</p>
                        <p>On August 31 the Embassy in London informed the Department: “FonOff (Oil
                            Department) seems believe that in view Dutch and French refusal US
                            decision not to protest represents best course of action, in that it
                            avoids Anglo-Saxon coloration and demonstrates that British <pb n="382"

                        <p>The Shah said that he had met with oil company officials in New York and
                            had indicated to them that they should support countries which are
                            stable and reliable and that they merely caused trouble by giving so
                            much to small desert countries such as Kuwait. He hoped the companies
                            would agree.<note n="2" xml:id="d209fn2">The gist of the position taken
                                by the oil executives is in a company briefing paper transmitted in
                                airgram A–690 from London, August 19. (Ibid., PET 2 IRAN) The oil
                                company executives later reported that “Shah made predictable plea
                                that Iran's stability and reliability be taken into consideration in
                                companies' planning and investment. Stressed that Arab-Israeli
                                crisis not ended and may revive.” They also characterized the Shah's
                                speeches as “milder than often in past. In sum, they feel results of
                                conversation 'not too bad,' although they remain concerned that
                                Iranian expectations will continue to exceed realities.” (Telegram
                                25746 to Tehran, August 23; ibid., PET 6 IRAN)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Commenting on Arab oil policies, he said it was ridiculous for any Arab
                            to believe that the West could really be hurt by an Arab oil embargo.
                            Iranian, Venezuelan and American oil are available. The West could stand
                            an oil embargo for a couple of years, but the Arab countries could not.
                            Agreeing, the Secretary commented that he has found it useful to suggest
                            to our moderate Arab friends that they make this point. The Shah said he
                            has been doing the same thing. The Secretary <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383"
                                facs="0413"/>said the Arab countries would not only hurt themselves
                            in the short run by imposing an oil embargo, but they might cause the
                            West to turn away from Middle East oil and substitute nuclear power on a
                            crash basis.</p>
                        <p>The Shah mentioned plans for an oil pipeline across Turkey to the
                            Mediterranean, for a gas pipeline from Iran to Trieste and for an oil
                            import terminal in Yugoslavia to supply Eastern Europe. On the latter
                            point, he said that the Eastern European market for oil is of course a
                            limited one. As for gas, he said that he would much prefer to use
                            Iranian gas to make petrochemical products, especially fertilizers, for
                            Iran and for export. He had urged the oil companies to interest
                            themselves and others in this possibility. In the meantime, however,
                            Iran was making plans to export gas, and it seemed desirable to have
                            customers in addition to the Soviet Union.</p>

                        <p>The Algerian Government has formally announced the nationalization of
                            five US-owned companies engaged in distributing and refining oil (Esso
                            Standard-Algeria, Esso Africa, Esso Saharienne, Mobiloil Nord-Africaine,
                            and Mobiloil Francaise).<note n="2" xml:id="d210fn2">The Algerian

                            Sonatrach, which has long had its eye on the Esso and Mobil distribution

                            Mobil affiliates, both producing companies, have escaped
                            nationalization. The decrees authorizing the nationalizations provide in

                            Esso and Mobil affiliates, Algeria appears to have been guided mainly by
                            political considerations. Despite strong pressures from the domestic
                            left, Industry Minister Abdesslam Belaid had previously resisted
                            nationalization of the distributing companies on the grounds that
                            Sonatrach would be unable for some time to absorb them efficiently, and
                            that they would eventually fall into the government's hands anyway;
                            indeed, the government has for some time been employing a strategy of
                            graduated harassment. The Middle East crisis has produced compelling
                            reasons, however, for overriding Abdesslam's reservations. Unable to
                            translate its hard line against Israel and its Western backers into
                            effective military action, the Boumediene regime can at least point to
                            its nationalization of US oil firms as proof of its militancy.</p>

                            unclear. Its short-term goal appears to be to force the producers to
                            accept the government's demands on a wide range of unresolved issues
                            (tax reference prices, arbitration, new investment).<note n="3"

                            cooperation and the stick of possible nationalization. Two major US
                            producers, Phillips and Sinclair, have been approached with tentative
                            offers of participation in new companies to be jointly owned by the
                            Algerian Government and the US firms. The latter would contribute their
                            present concessions as an investment and, in return, would be allowed to
                            manage the new firms without harassment. However, even should the US
                            companies agree—the initial reactions of the field representatives have
                            been positive—they would have little assurance of long-term security. In
                            Algeria political, rather than economic, considerations will continue to
                            shape government policies in the petroleum sector.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Findley</persName> began the discussion by stating that
                            Esso was unhappy that a note was sent to the Government of Algeria
                            without Esso first being consulted as to the content of the note.<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d211fn2">The text of the note was transmitted in
                                telegram 38371 to Algiers, September 15. (Ibid., PS 8–4
                                US–ALG)</note> Mr. <persName>Findley</persName> stated that Esso
                            objected to the note in that it gave the Algerian Government the
                            alternative of merely paying compensation for the nationalization of
                            Esso interests rather than insisting upon rescission of the actions and
                            restitution of the property. Mr. <persName>Findley</persName> stated
                            that the ordinances and decrees enacted by the Government of Algeria
                            were clearly discriminatory, arbitrary and confiscatory and that thus
                            restitution was the only appropriate remedy under international law as
                            interpreted by the United States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Salans</persName> pointed out that the historical United
                            States position was not that restitution was the only appropriate remedy
                            under the circumstances but rather that damages by the United States has
                            always been considered to be an equally satisfactory form of
                            reparation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Belman</persName> brought out the point that the <gloss
                                target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> Draft Convention on the Protection of
                            Foreign Property confirmed this fact. He referred specifically to the
                            notes and comments to Article 5 of the Draft Convention which discussed
                            “full reparation” in the event of an illegal act. He pointed out that
                            these notes and comments were altered at the <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386"
                                facs="0416"/>insistence of the United States to state that “in
                            practice, such reparation will generally take the form of damages.” He
                            stated that the reason for the United States insisting on this language
                            is because of a United States Supreme Court decision holding that the
                            federal government could never be bound to restore property it had taken
                            by eminent domain.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Belman</persName> went on to say that the United States
                            position for the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> draft with
                            respect to this question of reparation was reached following
                            consultation with the Business and Industry Advisory Committee and was
                            concurred in by that Committee. Mr. <persName>Belman</persName> stated
                            that he worked closely with Mr. <persName>Haitt</persName> of Shell Oil
                            Corp. on this question and that to his knowledge Mr.
                                <persName>Collado</persName> of Standard of New Jersey had been
                            involved.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Findley</persName> stated that he was unaware of what had
                            transpired in connection with the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>
                            Foreign Property Convention and was grateful for the information
                            regarding the United States position on reparations and how it had been
                            developed. Mr. <persName>Findley</persName> stated that he believed the
                            United States position was a poor one since it would have the effect of
                            selling the United States investment community down the river overseas.
                            He felt that foreign governments (especially those in the Middle East)
                            would have less hesitation about nationalizing United States properties
                            in violation of international law since they only would be required to
                            make some compensation which was rarely ever prompt, adequate or
                            effective. Mr. <persName>Salans</persName> pointed out that the
                            promptness, adequateness or effectiveness of compensation was a separate
                            question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Salans</persName> suggested that since the United States
                            note had already been delivered to the Government of Algeria, no
                            decision be taken at the moment on what the tactical position of the
                            United States should be with respect to reparations and that any such
                            decision would await a reply from the Government of Algeria. Mr.
                                <persName>Findley</persName> agreed with this course of action.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dick</persName> pointed out that the Government of Algeria
                            in 1964 took the position that “either compensation or restitution at
                            the discretion of the Algerian authorities” was the appropriate remedy
                            with regard to the properties nationalized pursuant to the decrees of
                            1963.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The December, 1966 agreement between the Iranian Oil Consortium and the
                            Government of Iran included the following points: the Consortium would
                            at least match the overall Middle East production increases in 1967 and
                            1968 (they had been running at about 10.5 percent increase each year)
                            and would make best efforts for subsequent years. Specifically, the
                            Consortium agreed to try to increase production from an average of 1.9
                            million bbls/day in 1966 to about 2.1 million bbls/day in 1967 and to
                            2.35 million bbls/day in 1968 (an increase of 11–12 percent per
                            annum).</p>
                        <p>Early this year the British became skittish about these production goals
                            and asked us to urge the American companies to make sure they would meet
                            them. The Secretary told the British Ambassador on March 3 that we had
                            no reason to believe they would not be able to and we were hence not
                            willing to raise the subject with the companies. Furthermore, we had no
                            indication that the Iranians were dissatisfied with the agreement.</p>
                        <p>Because the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> pipeline remained closed
                            for the first two months of this year and the Arabs stopped shipments to
                            the United States and the United Kingdom in June and July, Iranian
                            production has increased much more this year than expected and in the
                            first nine months it has averaged over 2.4 million bbls/day. Production
                            will probably drop below these levels for the remainder of the year but
                            the Consortium expects the average for the year to be at least 2.25
                            million bbls/day—an increase of 17 percent over 1966 levels and 150,000
                            bbls/day more than the projected increase for the year. (FYI: We believe
                            the Consortium estimate is deliberately low to allow room for
                            bargaining. Production for the year will probably average closer to 2.35
                            million bbls/day—the level which has been projected for 1968.) This
                            compares with an estimated increase in the Arab Middle East (not
                            including North Africa) of only 7 percent for the year.</p>
                        <pb n="388" xml:id="pg_388" facs="0418"/>
                        <p>Although the Shah expressed his satisfaction with the December, 1966
                            agreement, the Iranians apparently now wish to extract a new commitment
                            for 11 percent increases per annum based on December, 1967 capacity (not
                            production) of 3 million bbls/day, arriving at 4 million bbls/day
                            production in 1970 with a production capacity of about six million
                            bbls/day.</p>
                        <p>The Consortium believes it is highly unlikely that production figures can
                            be anywhere near this amount in 1970 unless there is some further
                            unexpected deterioration in operating conditions in the Arab world. At
                            an annual increase of 11 percent from 1966, Iranian production in 1970
                            should be about 2.9 million bbls/day; capacity at that time should be
                            around 3.6 million bbls/day. The Consortium has been reluctant to
                            increase capacity much beyond actual production, at least partially
                            because of the Iranian tendency to insist that production be kept near
                            maximum possible levels.</p>
                        <p>The Iranians have raised the subject with the Consortium, with the
                            British in London<note n="2" xml:id="d212fn2">The British Minister of
                                State told the Iranians that “Iranian demands are unrealistic; that
                                companies' plans are reasonable in current commercial context; and
                                that companies could not give Iran preference on political response
                                grounds without provoking undesirable political response in Iran's
                                Arab neighbors.” (Telegram 2851 from London, October 11; ibid., PET
                                6 IRAN) The British submitted a memorandum to the Department on
                                October 12 regarding their concern. (Ibid.)</note> and with our
                            Embassy in Tehran although Prime Minister Hoveyda said he realized there
                            was little the United States could do to influence the American

                                    difficult and probably impossible for any oil companies to make

                                companies. I noted how poorly Iraq been doing as result of its
                                excessive pressures and that situation there or in certain other
                                countries could easily get worse.</item>

                                Western oil companies will increase their offtakes from Saudi Arabia
                                and Kuwait which countries will then pay off UAR sums equivalent to

                        <p>After greetings Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAM4">Solomon</persName> opened
                            by saying our long-standing friendship with Iran made it possible to
                            discuss problems which arise between us in a completely frank manner
                            (the Ambassador concurred) <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0421"/>and
                            frankly, the Iranian requests to the U.S. Government both here and in
                            Tehran to insure greatly increased petroleum exports from Iran had
                            caused us considerable difficulty. The Department and the U.S.
                            Government had considerable sympathy for Iran's aspirations and great
                            admiration for its plans for development but this did not mean we were
                            able to translate this sympathy and admiration into pressures on the
                            American companies in the Consortium to comply with the Iranian
                            wishes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAM4">Solomon</persName> said that there should
                            be no confusion about the relationship between American companies
                            operating abroad and the Department of State. We give advice to
                            companies before they go into a country, if they ask for it; we
                            especially want our views known in cases where the companies ask for
                            U.S. Government assistance. But once a company is in a country it is on
                            its own. There are certainly some disadvantages to this but on balance
                            we believe that they are far outweighed by the advantages in our free
                            system where companies act according to their commercial interests
                            rather than in following instruction from the U.S. Government. The host
                            countries can therefore look on local branches of American firms as good
                            citizens, not as tools of U.S. foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>It is very important to recognize both the very limited nature of U.S.
                            influence over private firms and the reluctance, or even inability of
                            the US Government to set commercial policies of these firms abroad.
                            Venezuela for example has tried for eight years to get special
                            consideration for its oil exports. While the case is not comparable to
                            the Iranian requests there are some similarities. Venezuela is one of
                            our best friends in the Hemisphere and we have a common problem with
                            Castro but nonetheless, we have consistently refused to permit these
                            important political factors to influence our purely commercial policy
                            toward Venezuelan oil.</p>
                        <p>If the State Department should try to influence companies to favor Iran
                            or any other country, the reaction from companies operating elsewhere
                            and from Congress would be immediate and hostile. We can tell the
                            American companies in the Consortium of the Iranian approaches to us and
                            we can give them our views on the importance of Iran, as we have done
                            repeatedly, but in spite of our warm friendship for Iran we cannot do
                            more and Iran should not think that these mild interventions will
                            outweigh the companies' own purely commercial interests.</p>
                        <p>There are many complex factors which the companies have to consider. The
                            comparative cost of oil in Iran and elsewhere is extremely important.
                            And all of the American companies have interests in other oil producing
                            countries which must be protected. (Incidentally it seems to us that it
                            is in the interest of both Iran and the United States for such moderate
                            Arab nations in the area as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to be
                            strengthened.)</p>
                        <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0422"/>
                        <p>We are very interested in the Consortium activities and note with
                            pleasure that it has shown its willingness to see that Iran gets its
                            fair share of the Middle East offtake, but given the vagaries of the oil
                            industry, it is impossible to make long term commitments for offtake
                            from Iran for the next five years or even through 1970.</p>
                        <p>We can also understand why the companies in the Consortium are disturbed
                            by the Iranian desire to revise or even discard the 1966 offtake
                            agreement only ten months after it had been concluded to the apparent
                            satisfaction of all parties. As the Ambassador himself has noted, the
                            continuing Iranian pressure on the Consortium to use all production
                            facilities to their capacity has caused it to be reluctant to enlarge
                            facilities until they are actually needed. This does not seem in the
                            interest of anyone, as surplus capacity in Iran is necessary if Iran is
                            to increase production rapidly during any future oil crisis.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the Consortium has a vast marketing network which is extremely
                            important to Iran especially during times of a surplus of world oil
                            production. We would hope that the amicable relationship between the
                            Consortium and the Government of Iran which has proven so profitable to
                            Iran will continue uninterrupted.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said the points were well made but he feared that the
                            companies were ignoring other important considerations. Iran believes
                            that its special position warrants special treatment; Iran has a
                            development program which increases the wealth and the stability of Iran
                            and thereby benefits the West and the Western oil companies. Iran is
                            particularly disturbed at the increase in production of certain small
                            Arab countries who are given far more money than they can use and who
                            then give or lend this surplus capital to men like Nasser. The Iranians
                            consider it ironic that the Western oil companies are willing to
                            increase production and therefore royalties and taxes to these small
                            countries which are, quite directly, financing a man who is committed to
                            their destruction and to wiping out all Western influence in the Middle
                            East. Such a policy can only aggravate the instability of the area. Iran
                            believes that there is more than short-term economic profit to be
                            considered and the oil companies should look once again at what Iran is
                            doing with its income and compare it with actions of the small Arab
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAM4">Solomon</persName> said U.S. has
                            investments abroad valued at about $71 billion. The world-wide
                            investment in oil is of course important but it is only a minority of
                            the total. American companies operating abroad act according to their
                            own economic interests as they see them and none serves as a tool of the
                            U.S. Government. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAM4">Solomon</persName> then
                            said that the American oil companies have important investments in the
                            small Arab countries the Ambassador referred to and if any of the local
                            rulers thought that the American parent companies were shifting <pb
                                n="393" xml:id="pg_393" facs="0423"/>their emphasis from the Arab
                            world to Iran—particularly if they suspected it was at U.S. Government
                            instigation—they would certainly retaliate against the American
                            firms.</p>
                        <p>We must also be aware of the danger that general, undiscriminating
                            pressure frequently results in a reaction quite the opposite from that
                            which is intended.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador concluded by saying that it was clear that the Consortium
                            could not make firm commitments for the next five years; Iran had not
                            asked for this but only for an agreement in principle to increase
                            production. The next development plan, starting in March of 1968, is
                            based on a large income from the exploitation of oil and Iran must have
                            this money. The problems might start even before the new development
                            plan; the Ambassador had just been informed that because the increase in
                            oil earnings was less than expected, Iran would probably have deficit of
                            $110 million this year.</p>
                        <p>A short discussion of Iran's economic development followed.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said Iran had a 9.5 percent growth in GNP last year and
                            expected to have 11 percent this year—and all with a price inflation of
                            only 0.5%. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAM4">Solomon</persName> commented
                            that oil had made all this possible. The Ambassador agreed, said that
                            income from oil now runs about $700 million per year and provides about
                            70–75% of Iran's foreign exchange earnings. But this does not mean that
                            more money is not needed.</p>
                        <p>After leaving Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAM4">Solomon</persName>'s

                                    offtake levels to be achieved by the end of 1967. These were
                                    notably 3.1 million bpd production and 2.9 million bpd offtake,
                                    both of which are projected capacity figures, not actual
                                    production of offtake. (In fact, 1967 offtake is expected by the
                                    members to average about 2.3 million bpd.) Dr. Eqbal said that
                                    he had informed Finance Minister Amuzegar of offtake levels
                                    based on the above and that Mr. <persName>Amuzegar</persName>
                                    had used these figures as a basis for the computation of revenue
                                    from oil not only for the balance of 1967, but also for
                                    projections for future years….According to Mr.
                                        <persName>Amuzegar</persName>, assumptions about financing
                                    incorporated in the Fourth Plan were based on revenue figures
                                    derived from the above mentioned offtake figures. He repeated,
                                    as Dr. Eqbal had stated in London, that the <gloss

                                    1968.” The effects of the miscalculation were far-reaching: “Mr.

                            <item>Re natural gas, Shah said estimates for building pipeline (with

                                cost more likely to be in $1 billion to $1.2 billion range. He
                                disclosed new idea, apparently being developed by French, whereby
                                Soviets would deliver to France quantities of natural gas equivalent

                                border (via second pipeline) and French would pay Iranians in free
                                foreign exchange. Shah said this proposal is agreeable to Iranians
                                because it means foreign exchange rather than bartered Soviet goods.
                                He acknowledged, however, that French have yet to negotiate such
                                deal with Soviets.</item>

                                suggested Iran may be trying to carry water on both shoulders, i.e.
                                pushing Consortium to find greater markets while at same time
                                stealing some of Consortium's markets, e.g. recent IPAC deal for
                                providing 18,000 bpd to Philippines which previously been almost
                                exclusively market for American majors in Consortium. Shah argued
                                such competition is infinitesimal compared with bonanzas greedy oil

                                places Libya in favorable situation with Suez closed, Shah said what
                                really infuriates him is companies' lifting large quantities from
                                Sheikhdoms like Kuwait and Abu Dhabi when Iran with its 26,000,000
                                people needs funds to maintain its progress and play its role in
                                Mideast security. Shah also asserted that Saudi Arabia's production
                                will soon move up to 4,000,000 barrels per day. Since geographic
                                factor a la Libya cannot be applied vis-à-vis Saudi Arabia, this
                                further demonstrates he said, how companies discriminate against

                                to point to Iraq's sorry plight today and how much better off Iran
                                is. I urged Shah “with every bone in my body” not to go down Iraqi

                                with pipeline through Syria, Soviets can get both Iraq and Syria in
                                their clutches, thus leapfrogging over Turkey and Iran. This would
                                place them in dominating position in Mideast, particularly since

                                    xml:id="d218fn3">In a March 18 letter to Robert Dowell, Jr.,
                                    Petroleum Attachè in Tehran, Akins noted that despite the fact
                                    that the oil companies felt a change in the overlift arrangement
                                    would make no difference to Iran, they were reluctant to make a
                                    change. He wrote: “John Oliver and I called company
                                    vice-presidents March 14, told them of our views of the
                                    seriousness of the situation and the impression we got from them
                                    was, 'Tough; but a clash has become inevitable and we might as
                                    well have it now and get it over with.' Mr.
                                        <persName>Rostow</persName> will probably call the
                                    presidents or executive vice-presidents to Washington next week
                                    to go over the same material. I doubt if he will be effective in
                                    persuading them of anything unless they are frightened. Maybe
                                    they will be. The Shah is an oriental despot and the oil
                                    executives are dinosaurs. If they come to blows it could be the
                                    battle of the century.” (National Archives and Records

                                shareholders on the two essential points: 1) the Shah's demands for
                                20 percent annual increase in off-take cannot be met, in fact, 8–9
                                percent growth is all that can be assured in 1968, and 2) <gloss

                                understand there is also essential agreement now on new
                                quarter-price arrangements on over-liftings. Although some companies
                                might well wish to be allowed to take, at cost, more than their
                                equity share, this opposed by <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss> as
                                well as all American majors and we doubt that other companies
                                seriously believe refusal to permit this could be called constraint
                                of trade.<note n="4" xml:id="d218fn4">In his letter to Dowell, Akins
                                    wrote: “Your references to 'restraint of trade' were a bit
                                    disturbing. We were surprised to see the accusation put into a
                                    telegram which was given fairly wide distribution in the
                                    Government. But fortunately the strong anti-oil company voices
                                    in Treasury and Commerce do not seem to have picked up the
                                    matter. They couldn't get very far, in any case, given the fact
                                    that the American companies were given specific exemption from
                                    anti-trust legislation when they entered the Consortium.”</note>

                            Russian attack on US policy there. Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName>'s
                            message in his press conference had been a) for the US public, that the
                            US does not have to fill every military vacuum left by a British or
                            French withdrawal, and b) for the Russians, that the US is interested in
                            seeing vacuums filled, and security assured. Our hope is that security
                            can be provided by the cooperation of the states in the area. He
                            believed that much of the current Russian propaganda was in preparation

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> noted that the two strong countries in

                            are neutral in any controversy between them. We encourage their close

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> went on to say that we are now in a
                            peculiar situation vis-à-vis Iran, with the Shah unhappy and suspicious
                            that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has favored Saudi Arabia
                            over Iran in the Median Line issue.<note n="3" xml:id="d219fn3"
                                >Reference is to an ongoing dispute over division of the waters in
                                the Persian Gulf and the search to determine a “fair” median line.
                                Because Gulf waters are so shallow, there is no differentiation
                                between a Continental Shelf and a seabed, leading to ownership
                                problems over the oil resources of the seabed. The issue was further
                                complicated by the question of sovereignty over the large number of
                                islands in Gulf.</note> The arms issue is also involved with special
                            reference to Iran's responsibilities in the Gulf after the British
                            departure.</p>
                        <p>After thorough consideration of why the Shah feels as strongly as he does
                            on the oil issue with the Consortium, Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName>
                            remarked that while the government did not wish to take responsibility
                            or to become involved in a commercial negotiation, we did have a
                            national interest in successful and harmonious resolution of the oil
                            negotiations, to the mutual satisfaction of the parties. We had
                            important long term political interests in good relations both with Iran
                            and with Saudi Arabia. Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> wondered whether
                            what the Shah really wants is the same level of production of oil as
                            Saudi Arabia has. The Shah's present unsettled mood is probably due to
                            many other factors too. Russia is one, but the Shah knows the Russians
                            are his enemies and wants his arms from the US.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> commented that if current oil
                            negotiations work out, he was hopeful that agreement on the Median Line
                            could also be reached. He had raised the thought of arbitration, but
                            there are many problems, including conflicting claims for various
                            islands. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CH2">Cash</persName> said that the
                            Shah's demands are so far from reality that they could not be met.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> said that the Shah is also concerned with
                            the internal rules of the Consortium. He believes that some companies
                            are short of oil and would be very glad to take more if the internal
                            rules of the Consortium permitted.<note n="4" xml:id="d219fn4">See <ref

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PGL1">Parkhurst</persName> said the French
                            certainly want more, but they have only made a small investment and he
                            questioned whether it was fair to other members of the Consortium to
                            allow them to take more. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PG2"
                                >Piercy</persName> pointed out that the demand for Middle East oil
                            is limited and more offtake by some companies would reduce sales by
                            others. In response to Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName>'s reiteration of
                            the possibility that the psychological and political key to the Shah's
                            problem is equality with Saudi <pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0433"
                            />Arabia in production and growth, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PGL1"
                                >Parkhurst</persName> said he had never heard of this suggestion
                            before, but, in any case, the companies involved had no cartel and could
                            not arrange matters that way. In the first place, there was no way to
                            divide up the “pie” and secondly, although the companies can explain how
                            (as a result of the Arab-Israeli war and aftermath) Iran's offtake grew
                            22% in 1967 as compared to about 8% in Saudi Arabia, they will be
                            hard-pressed this year by the Saudis who will be anxious to catch up.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CH2">Cash</persName> agreed that whatever the
                            Shah gets, Saudi Arabia will also demand. If the Shah gets cost oil,
                            then Saudi Arabia—and Kuwait—will also demand it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PG2">Piercy</persName> said there had been some
                            confusion in the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> demands on the
                            Consortium. The <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> demand for $5.9
                            million over five years apparently covered all <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                >GOI</gloss> oil revenue. However, income from the various joint
                            ventures in the Gulf would mean only about $14 million a year, from a
                            production of 150,000 bpd. The “gap” in 1968 is about 250,000 bpd and
                            this will be worse in future years.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> voiced his hope that the matter could be
                            resolved. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CH2">Cash</persName> said that in
                            his opinion the Consortium was heading for a head-on collision with the
                            Shah. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PGL1">Parkhurst</persName> said that the
                            only hope for working out a solution was in confidential discussions and
                            now the Prime Minister has brought charges in the open. Mr.
                                <persName>Folmar</persName> commented that the Consortium had done
                            the best it could.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> said that all he could add, from the
                            point of view of the United States, is that Iran is the strongest
                            country in the Gulf, is moving ahead, and is interested in maintaining
                            its momentum. The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> must rely on Iran,
                            not in any way at the expense of Saudi Arabia, but a cooperative
                            relation between Iran and Saudi Arabia was necessarily the keystone of
                            United States plans and hopes for the area.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PGL1">Parkhurst</persName> commented that
                            although Iran may be number one, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait were the next
                            two in importance. Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> agreed and said that
                            only if all worked together could serious problems in the South of the
                            Gulf be forestalled.</p>
                        <p>Several representatives pointed out foreseeable problems for Middle East
                            oil in the coming year. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PG2">Piercy</persName>
                            said 1968 was considered a low growth rate year—or “Crunch Year”—with
                            increasing competition with Libya and continued closure of the Suez
                            Canal likely. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PGL1">Parkhurst</persName>
                            mentioned that the sulphur problem was becoming more severe, with more
                            emphasis on quality. African producers had a location advantage, even if
                            the canal were open, and he could see low Persian Gulf growth down the
                            road.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> then mentioned the stir caused in Germany
                            when it appeared that some foreign buyer, through a Swiss bank, was
                            trying to take over the (German) Gelsenberg Oil Company. Although the
                            offering buyer had not been identified, there had been deep concern <pb
                                n="404" xml:id="pg_404" facs="0434"/>that Americans were trying to
                            take over the company, and the Germans showed marked political
                            sensitivity on the subject. This sensitivity to American ownership, even
                            in Germany, pointed out a field in which American companies operating
                            abroad should carefully consider their policy in the long run. Companies
                            should consider bringing in foreign partners and spreading the venture
                            over a wider range of people. The troubles we had had in Mexico and
                            Canada were not unique. It would be prudent to establish as broad a base
                            as possible for American investment abroad.</p>

                            of California, Texaco, Gulf and Iricon (morning March 28) Undersec
                                <persName>Rostow</persName> said <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            wished to have candid exchange of views with them about Iranian oil
                            negotiations in their full political context. We did not wish to cross
                            the delicate line between political and commercial considerations nor
                            did we wish to take responsibility for the negotiations. But there was a
                            deep national interest in a mutually satisfactory outcome for the
                            negotiations at this time. The Consortium came into being with special
                            anti-trust and other privileges by reason of such political
                            considerations. He wished to discuss directly with the responsible
                            leadership of the companies the political factors we saw impinging on
                            the negotiating process.</p>
                        <p>So far as the Persian Gulf was concerned, we faced a national security
                            problem in view of the British withdrawal, and the risk of penetration
                            of weak Gulf States by movements of radical Arab nationalism, as well as
                            by more direct Soviet interventions. In that perspective, Iran was the
                            keystone of American plans. We wished to have equal friendship with Iran
                            and with Saudi Arabia, and close cooperation between them. At this
                            point, Iran was clearly the stronger partner, progressive and
                            developing. But Saudi cooperation with Iran was indispensable <pb
                                n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0435"/>from every point of view,
                            political, psychological and geographic, if stability in the Persian
                            Gulf was to be assured. <persName>Rostow</persName> reviewed recent
                            history and present prospects of efforts to bring Shah and Feisal
                            together, and stressed importance of an oil settlement compatible with
                            the necessities of that process.</p>
                        <p>But Persian Gulf problem was intimately linked to Middle East crisis as a
                            whole. After reporting on problems of M.E. since Nov. 22 S.C.
                                Resolution,<note n="2" xml:id="d220fn2">UN Security Council
                                Resolution 242 of November 22, 1967. The resolution called for a
                                “just and lasting peace in which every State in the area can live in
                                security.” (UN doc. S/RES/242 (1967), printed in <hi rend="italic"

                            <persName>Rostow</persName> said we regarded the situation as
                            increasingly grave. UAR was blocking progress on the Jarring Mission.
                            And Syria—perhaps UAR as well—were training and sending out terrorists
                            on a very dangerous scale. Jordan had a Vietcong on its territory, as
                            Laos does, and could no longer control it. In the absence of peace
                            negotiations, Israeli reprisals were inevitable, despite our urgent
                            efforts to prevent them. As a result, there was a serious possibility of
                            renewed general hostilities in the Middle East, with incalculable
                            potentialities. We were working on a crisis footing to head off
                            hostilities, but we could not be sure of the outcome.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName>Rostow</persName> referred to Shah's statements that he
                            cooperated with West at his great risk during crisis last June. If he
                            felt this cooperation not recognized through favorable treatment by

                            new crisis.<note n="3" xml:id="d220fn3">On March 19 Enders reported to
                                    <persName>Rostow</persName> that oil analyst Walter Levy told
                                Department officials: “Can't predict whether or not the Shah will
                                make good on his threat. But clearly there is a strong risk he will.
                                Therefore companies should make up their mind on basis of how well
                                they, the United States and indeed the West as a whole could stand
                                another crisis in the Middle East. In Levy's judgment we are all in
                                period of relative weakness given Soviet position in Middle East,
                                threat of another Arab-Israeli blow-up, and payments crisis. We
                                could not absorb a break with Iran. Even if companies are right,
                                they should stand on principle only when strong. We would never
                                forgive ourselves if we superimposed an Iranian crisis on what could
                                be a general payments and Middle East crisis.” (Memorandum from

                            <persName>Rostow</persName> also said withdrawal of British from area
                            made it necessary for Iran to cooperate with Arabs in Gulf and in a new
                            round of hostilities he might not be willing risk their wrath by
                            breaking Arab blockade again. As companies knew, even temporary boycott
                            of Middle East oil, if it included Iranian production, would be
                            catastrophic.</p>
                        <p>3. Iran, he said, has written $5.9 billion into its development plan and
                            Shah would not change it. We know companies cannot give Iran all it
                            wants for its plan but we also believe that if there is some increase
                                <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0436"/>in earlier estimates there
                            will be chance of averting confrontation and new crisis in Iran this
                            year.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName>Rostow</persName> asked without prejudice about possibility
                            of investment commitments, raising APQ, altering over-lift arrangements
                            to permit crude-hungry companies to take more oil, on equitable terms,
                            increasing refinery throughput, and making special allowances for
                            British Petroleum if it decided to reduce Abu Dhabi production in favor
                            of Iran. Desirability of equality of treatment between Iran and Saudi
                            Arabia was stressed, and generally accepted. Companies said they are
                            examining all these possibilities and said all offered some room for
                            adjustment but they gave no definite assurances on any.</p>
                        <p>5. They pointed to certainty more favorable treatment Iran would result
                            immediate demands from Arab and other producing countries which they
                            could not meet.<note n="4" xml:id="d220fn4">According to Enders, Levy
                                did not believe that parity with Saudi Arabian production would
                                “cause a problem” in Riyadh. (Ibid.)</note> In reference this as
                            well as to willingness French other “oil hungry” companies to take more
                            cost oil they said such oil could only be sold at expense current
                            marketing since demand was being fully met. <persName>Rostow</persName>
                            said <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> recognized all alternatives
                            were impossible, but we would weigh the political value of a settlement
                            with Iran very highly.</p>
                        <p>6. Companies asked <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> attempt convince
                            Iran that Consortium trying help it meet development goals.
                                <persName>Rostow</persName> said we had done this repeatedly and
                            would do so again, if companies assured us they would make genuine
                            effort to reach satisfactory agreement. This assurance was given. To be
                            effective, companies would probably have to improve their estimates and
                            do everything economically feasible to help Iran. Companies said they
                            knew any approach would have to be on this basis.</p>
                        <p>7. At end of meeting question was asked whether <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> seriously thought risk of confrontation, and of rash
                            and destructive action by Shah, was high. <persName>Rostow</persName>
                            answered affirmatively, and said our concern over this risk was the
                            subject matter of meeting, and the reason it was called.</p>
                        <p>8. Company position throughout meeting was neither hostile or negative
                            and we believe they will endeavour seriously to devise new offer before
                            April 20. Clearly any new offer will be below Iranian demands but we
                            hope enough will be offered to avert crisis this year.</p>

                            preliminary meeting of oil ministers in Beirut on July 25. The Libyan

                            named a secretary general and set up working committees, and the Saudi

                            Libyan “no show”, a more likely reason was concern that Saudi Arabia and

                        <p>The Mobil representative reported that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1"

                        <p>The Mobil representative was very pessimistic about the oil situation. He
                            believes that the Iraqi Government has not yet formulated an oil policy.
                            The <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> needs money badly and may offer
                            settlement of specific minor issues as a quid pro quo for cash payments.
                            However, it does not appear that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            is prepared to settle any territorial problems. In this connection,
                            there is nothing new on the question of <gloss target="#t_IPC1"

                        <p>When the Mobil representative met with Uquaily he was asked if <gloss
                                target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> was still concerned about repercussions
                            elsewhere over any agreement that might be reached with the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. He was assured that this indeed was a
                            concern of <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>. Uquaily also wanted to
                            know if the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> partners had given
                                <gloss target="#t_CFP1">CFP</gloss> a green light to negotiate for
                            Iraqi territory. The answer was negative.</p>
                        <p>Former Oil Minister Abdul Aziz Wattari will reportedly return to Iraq as
                            a private citizen in the near future. Uquaily said that no political
                            significance should be applied to his return.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, Mr. <persName>Wolgast</persName> said that an <gloss

                            for exploratory talks. The team will not be authorized to negotiate or
                            discuss any substantive points, thereby avoiding any confrontation with

                                willingness extend hospitality. I assured board we fully aware of

                        <p>The temporary settlement in April 1968 of current disputes between the
                            Iranian Government and the group of western oil companies known as the
                            Iranian Oil Consortium gave the companies additional time to determine
                            their joint position for the subsequent round of negotiations, which
                            began on September 30, 1968, at the semi-annual Consortium/National
                            Iranian Oil Company meeting in London. This paper will attempt to
                            present the background and an analysis of the problems involved.</p>

                        <p>In order to achieve an exceptionally large increase in its oil revenues
                            for several years to come, the Iranian Government will in the next few
                            months bring heavy pressure to bear upon the Iranian Oil Consortium.
                            Wishful thinking plus an error in computation<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d226fn2">See <ref target="#d215fn3">footnote 3, Document
                                    215</ref>.</note> has led the Iranians to plan upon a level of
                            revenue from future Consortium operations that is, in the Consortium's
                            view, far above the probable figure, and the government has been so
                            informed.</p>
                        <p>The Iranian position, in essence, is that Iran's development needs (in
                            particular, its fourth five-year development plan, covering the Iranian
                            years 1347–51, roughly 1968–72) require a certain level of funds, that
                            oil is the only Iranian resource capable of generating that level, and
                            that the bulk of the necessary oil must come from the Consortium's
                            concession area, which contains by far the most prolific known and
                            presently operational deposits. The Iranians would prefer, as the
                            simplest solution (and the only one likely to succeed), that the members
                            of the Consortium lift enough oil to provide, through the usual
                            royalties and taxes, the desired level of governmental revenue.</p>
                        <p>If the Consortium is unable to do this, it must provide the National
                            Iranian Oil Company (<gloss target="#t_NIOC1">NIOC</gloss>) with a
                            sufficient quantity of oil from the Consortium area at a low enough
                            price so that <gloss target="#t_NIOC1">NIOC</gloss> could make up <pb
                                n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0443"/>the shortfall in revenue
                            through its own sales or barter arrangements. The oil could be provided
                            by modifying the terms of the Consortium's 1966 agreement to make barter
                            oil available to <gloss target="#t_NIOC1">NIOC</gloss>, by turning over
                            to <gloss target="#t_NIOC1">NIOC</gloss> an already producing field in
                            the Consortium area, or by conferring upon the Iranian Government
                            membership in the Consortium. The government has indicated that, in case
                            of refusal, Iran might take unilateral measures to obtain the oil.</p>
                        <p>In spite of the apparent Iranian determination to reach, in one way or
                            another, its revenue goal, the government is very probably aware that
                            this goal is unattainable—that the Consortium is in fact doing its best
                            to increase its offtake but will not be able to meet Iranian demands,
                            that additional sales by <gloss target="#t_NIOC1">NIOC</gloss> could not
                            possibly close the gap, and that any unilateral measures Iran might take
                            in an attempt to reach its goal not only would not accomplish that end
                            but might prove to be disastrous.</p>
                        <p>There have been indications of Iranian hesitation to enter into an
                            irreconcilable confrontation with the Consortium. The Iranians backed
                            down in April 1968 with a “Persian solution” to the problems raised by
                            their demands. They shifted the time frame of the dispute. Their recent
                            offer to discuss production capacity as well as actual offtake of oil
                            has opened up another avenue which could at least postpone a showdown.
                            If the Consortium remains adamant about future commitments on offtake,
                            refusing to promise the levels the Iranians are demanding, the
                            government can back down again by accepting Consortium assurances that
                            the necessary production capacity will be available in case Consortium
                            offtake or a combination of Consortium offtake and <gloss
                                target="#t_NIOC1">NIOC</gloss> offtake for barter purposes should by
                            some chance reach the desired level. The Consortium is apparently in a
                            position to make such a commitment for at least one year and possibly
                            two.</p>
                        <p>With room for the Iranians to retreat, we believe they will probably do
                            so. They will make every effort to better their position, such as by
                            obtaining easier terms for barter oil and some additional minor
                            concessions, as well as the highest possible offtake commitments, but we
                            strongly doubt that they are as yet prepared to resort to unilateral
                            measures of compulsion if their demands are not met.</p>

                        <p>The Prime Minister asked Dr. Fallah to join the meeting for a discussion
                            of oil matters. He said that Iran has no problems in the current year
                            with the Oil Consortium but that it hopes for one billion dollars in oil
                            revenues next year (<hi rend="italic">comment</hi>: presumably the
                            Iranian year beginning March 21, 1969). The member companies of the
                            Consortium are considering this request, but have not yet responded.
                            Last year, he said, the Shah told the companies that if they could not
                            meet Iran's requirements, Iran would find its own markets. He decried
                            what he described as the companies' policy of supporting such states as
                            Abu Dhabi and Kuwait that either have no useful way to employ their oil
                            revenues or use them to support radical Arabs.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister went on to say that Iran is now looking at the
                            American market. One way to sell oil to the United States would be
                            through the present American quota system, using the proceeds to
                            purchase American goods. Iran might possibly buy into an American firm
                            having an import quota. In any case, the Prime Minister said, two
                            aspects of this situation deserved special mention. One is the fact that
                            the United States needs additional oil reserves. Iran has entered into a
                            contract with another country (<hi rend="italic">comment</hi>: South
                            Africa; see below) desirous of stockpiling oil and has asked a private
                            firm for a study on a similar possible contract with the United States.
                            Iran would give this study to the United States Government for its
                            consideration. Iran could use the proceeds from such sales to the United
                            States to buy American <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415" facs="0445"
                            />products. The second aspect of the matter was possible sales of
                            petroleum products to the Department of Defense.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Fallah said that sales to the Department of Defense pose a problem
                            because <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> purchases on the basis of
                            public tender. The Secretary asked if Dr. Fallah meant that Iran could
                            not meet the price competition. Dr. Fallah said that the National
                            Iranian Oil Company (<gloss target="#t_NIOC1">NIOC</gloss>) would act as
                            the Consortium's agent. The Prime Minister said that the <gloss
                                target="#t_NIOC1">NIOC</gloss> would find a market for the
                            Consortium. The <gloss target="#t_NIOC1">NIOC</gloss> would make no
                            money as an agent, but Iran would profit through the taxes the
                            Consortium would pay on higher production. Dr. Fallah said that Iran
                            desires a three-year contract with <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>,
                            but the latter won't go beyond six months. This and not price is the
                            problem. The Prime Minister said that Dr. Fallah would be talking with
                                <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> officials. The Secretary said
                            that we can be sympathetic provided that the price is right, but we do
                            not want to subsidize the seller.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Fallah said that on the other aspect of the Iranian plan to sell oil
                            to the United States, Iran believes that it is in the US interest to buy
                            inexpensive Iranian oil. The Secretary asked how such purchases would be
                            financed. He said that he couldn't imagine the Congress financing an oil
                            stockpile. Dr. Fallah said that at some time in the future, the United
                            States, like South Africa, might finance a stockpile. Iran could provide
                            credit for that part of the sale whose proceeds would go to Iran.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that from the standpoint of national resources policy
                            there was some logic in the Iranian proposal. But to translate the
                            proposal into financial and political terms would be difficult. He asked
                            if such a proposition might not be more attractive for Western Europe.
                            Dr. Fallah replied that Western Europe is already a market for Iranian
                            oil. The Secretary commented that in our case, the proposal would appear
                            to hurt our own producers who wouldn't trust their government to keep
                            the stockpile locked up. Dr. Fallah said that the major American
                            companies would like the proposal.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he was interested in the subject and would give it
                            more thought, but there are political and financial problems. Dr. Fallah
                            said that Alaskan finds are not the permanent answer to American oil
                            needs and added that the Iranian proposal would not hurt the American
                            balance of payments. The Secretary repeated that the proposal is
                            politically very difficult. He asked that Iran provide us with its
                            studies informally and that future discussions be on an informal
                            basis.</p>

                        <p>At my request Admiral Lattu, Director of the Office of Oil and Gas,
                            Department of the Interior, called a meeting on May 23 of Interior's
                            experts on fuel supply and transport to discuss possible effects of the
                            current Middle East crisis on world oil supply.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d228fn2">Interior's Office of Oil and Gas had been studying
                                the problem since the beginning of May. Early that month, the
                                Petroleum Security Subcommittee of the Foreign Petroleum Supply
                                Committee recommended that the Department of Defense, as a
                                precautionary measure, consider alternative sources for the 200,000
                                b/d purchased from Persian Gulf refineries. This figure represented
                                80 percent of oil used by U.S. military forces in the Pacific.
                                Alternatives were suggested but the meeting was recessed until June
                                5 to gather more data. (Memorandum reviewing potential petroleum
                                developments, May 31; ibid.)</note> State was represented by myself,
                            Jim Akins, Maxwell Harway of the Vietnam working group, and Stephen
                            Rogers of <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss>/RPE.</p>
                        <p>Jim Akins gave a short briefing on the current political scene in the
                            Middle East; we believe that if fighting starts the best we could hope
                            for would be a loss of only the two pipelines, the worst would be a
                            loss, through government action or sabotage of all Arab oil and the
                            closing of the Suez canal. The actual situation would probably lie
                            between the two extremes.</p>
                        <p>Interior's experts conclude that the loss of two of the five major Middle
                            East producers (Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Libya) and the Suez
                            canal would be tolerable. (We note that the loss of Kuwait and Saudi
                            Arabia together would create serious disturbances.) Loss of more would
                            cause disruptions in Europe (and Japan) commensurate to the size of the
                            loss.</p>

                        <p>Arab production is now as follows (millions of b/d):</p>
                        <p>Saudi Arabia—3.2</p>
                        <p>Kuwait—2.9</p>
                        <p>Iraq—.9</p>

                        <p>The emergency oil would be expensive. Europe currently imports about 7.5
                            million b/d for which it pays $6.7 billion per year. Under emergency
                            conditions about 3.9 million b/d could probably be made available to
                            Europe but the cost would be $5.7 billion per year—a per barrel increase
                            of about 67%.</p>
                        <p>The problem is solely that of crude oil; tankers are available or can be
                            made available to ship it but at a higher cost than currently is
                            paid.</p>

                            American oil companies with foreign operations. Its company participants
                            are immune from anti-trust action. It last functioned during the Suez

                            scheduled to meet again on June 5. If the situation in the Middle East
                            deteriorates it will be asked to come to Washington by the end of this

                            <p>Although it may not be the prime reason for Nasser's bellicose stand,
                                he seems to be using the overheated atmosphere to excite the
                                citizenry and armies of Saudi Arabia and Jordan to overthrow their
                                “reactionary” rulers. Unless he gets full cooperation from Kuwait
                                and Libya he is likely to try to overthrow the rulers of those two
                                countries as well. His chances of success in these long-standing
                                plans will be enhanced if his armies give a good showing against
                                Israel—the aura of the conquering hero. Paradoxically, they would
                                also be increased if <pb n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0449"/>the
                                Israelis succeed in occupying parts of Jordan, Egypt, Syria and
                                Lebanon; the case would then be made that Arabism was threatened and
                                could only survive if the “lackies of imperialism” were thrown out.
                                Hussain is more vulnerable than Faisal.</p>
                            <p>It is impossible to calculate what is activating Nasser (the
                                Russians? Are they finally yielding to Chinese taunts of being
                                afraid to distract the Americans away from Vietnam?). He may be
                                risking a war with Israel, may even expect to be defeated (and then
                                rescued by the UN) but will consider it worthwhile if he can, during
                                the process, bring down Hussain, Faisal and perhaps the Kuwaiti and
                                Libyan thrones.</p>

                            will be war between the Arabs and Israel. Syria is pushing Nasser toward
                            war and Russia must not resist the Syrians too sharply because Moscow
                            fears Syria is leaning toward Peiping.</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft">Dear <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Dean</persName>:</p>
                        <p>I have just had read to me over the telephone a communication from <gloss
                                target="#t_ARAMCO1">Aramco</gloss> reporting a conversation which
                            the head of <gloss target="#t_ARAMCO1">Aramco</gloss> in Saudi Arabia
                            had with King Faisal, which I think you will be interested in reading. I
                            am enclosing a copy of the message herewith but meanwhile I have asked
                            the Washington Office of <gloss target="#t_ARAMCO1">Aramco</gloss> to
                            deliver a copy of it to you this afternoon.<note n="2" xml:id="d231fn2"
                                >Not printed. In this June 5 cable from Dhahran, Aramco's R.I.
                                Brougham reported on a conversation with King Faisal that was
                                intended to be a courtesy call after his return from Geneva. Upon
                                arrival, Brougham learned that Egypt had been attacked by Israel.
                                The King, in a very somber mood, said that the issue had been joined
                                and that the Arabs and Israelis could no longer live together—“one
                                side or another must be defeated.” “No direct reference to <gloss
                                    target="#t_ARAMCO1">Aramco</gloss> nor oil policy but His
                                Majesty has made it perfectly clear that major powers and America in
                                particular must not become involved in conflict on either side
                                because consequences of such involvement on behalf of Israel will
                                leave Arab states no alternative but to take measures against those
                                countries involved in providing such assistance.”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>I have also received just now a communication from Dr. Calvin Plimpton,
                            President of Amherst College and Chairman of the Board of the American
                            University in Beirut, to the effect that the President of the latter
                            institution (the American University) has asked him to stress with the
                            U.S. Government that any stand by the United States against the Arab
                            position in favor of Israel could have the deepest consequences in
                            prejudicing the good relations between the United States and the Arab
                            world. He referred to the fact that all of the important Christian
                            professors on the University's faculty feel strongly to the same effect.
                            I do not know whether this communication was sent before or after the
                            outbreak this morning, but I am certain that the view of the President
                            of the American University would not be moderated by anything that
                            happened today.</p>

                                in Baghdad to coordinate action. (Telegram 2029 from Baghdad, May

                        <p>On June 5, 1967, war broke out between Israel and the United Arab
                            Republic, Syria, and Jordan. At 7:40 a.m. on June 6, Radio Cairo began
                            broadcasting the charge that U.S. aircraft had participated in the
                            Israeli attacks. (Telegram 8565 from Cairo, June 6; National Archives
                            and Records Administration, RG 59, Records of the Department of State,
                            Central Files, 1967–69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27 ARAB–ISR)
                            The same day, Iraq was the first to announce that the flow of oil to the
                            United States and the United Kingdom was cut off in light of “military
                            assistance to the enemy,” and called on the other Arab oil producers to
                            follow through on their resolutions of the previous day (see <ref
                                target="#d232">Document 232</ref>). When the Charge denied the
                            charge, the Iraqis said that the information about U.S.-U.K.
                            intervention had come from the UAR and Syria. The Embassy commented: “In
                            this whole tortured business, this is possibly kind of action President
                            Aref might take to protect oil installations of Iraq. We had been in
                            touch privately with certain government officials earlier who have
                            indicated they powerless deal with allegation of US involvement since
                            all actions on this score clearly coordinated and linked with Cairo.”

                            and was preparing to prevent shipment of oil to the United Kingdom and
                            United States. The oil companies did not, however, expect that their
                            assets would be confiscated. The Kuwaiti Government, the Embassy
                            concluded, would “prefer that we not evacuate.” (Telegram 1262 <pb

                            708 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, and which gives
                            the participants the protection under the antitrust laws and Federal

                        <p>As you know, the Foreign Petroleum Supply Committee was used as the
                            vehicle for American industry collaboration in meeting the Suez crisis
                            of 1956–57. A Plan of Action was drawn up on August 10, 1956 and amended
                            on November 30, 1956 (with Attorney General approval on December 3,
                            1956), under which the Middle East Emergency Committee was established
                            and authorized, within the limitations set forth in the Plan of Action,
                            to deal with foreign agencies and foreign industry committees in meeting
                            the emergency. Coordination across the Atlantic was effected through the
                            dealings of the Middle East Emergency Committee with these three
                            European industry advisory committees: first, the British-organized Oil
                            Supply Advisory Committee (OSAC); next, the British, French and
                            Dutch-organized Oil Emergency London Advisory Committee (OELAC); and,
                            finally, following the closure of the Suez Canal and the <gloss
                                target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> pipelines, the OEEC-organized OEEC
                            Petroleum Emergency Group (OPEG). In each case, the activities of the
                            Middle East Emergency Committee were approved by the Administrator or
                            Director of the Voluntary Agreement Relating to Foreign Petroleum Supply
                            and were thus brought within the protection of that agreement.</p>
                        <p>I am sure that the question of industry collaboration with the <gloss

                            already being discussed, at the governmental level.<note n="3"

                        <p>Recent developments affecting the United States access to foreign sources
                            of crude oil have clear implications for the national security.<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d235fn2">A provision of the Defense Production Act of
                                1950 authorized the President to take into account the oil supply
                                situations of allies and friendly countries in determining the
                                national security of the United States.</note> In the past few days
                            the Governments of Algeria, Kuwait and Bahrein have prohibited the
                            export of petroleum to the United States or to the United Kingdom. The
                            Government of Iraq has ordered the Iraq Petroleum Company to cease
                            operations. The Trans Arabian Pipeline of the Arabian American Oil
                            Company has been closed, as has the Suez Canal. The Libyan Government
                            has ordered foreign oil companies to cease operations.</p>
                        <p>The denial of petroleum from these sources creates an oil supply
                            emergency and adversely affects the capability of the United States and
                            our allies to meet our security responsibilities. I consider that this
                            situation calls for the initiation of emergency procedures to ensure
                            that adequate supplies of petroleum continue to be available.<note n="3"

                                it was obvious that if some countries could go on obtaining Middle
                                East oil, this would make it possible to rearrange supply patterns
                                in way that would maximize scarcities. Moreover, request for
                                postponement did not mean France was attempting to go back on

                                reaction to his proposal. He replied Foreign Office had commented
                                merely that it seemed very late hour for calling off meeting
                                scheduled to convene on Monday. Jordan did not know reactions of

                                prepared for this question, and said merely that no decision in this

                        <p>On June 10, 1967, Kuwaiti oil workers began a strike that completely shut
                            down AMINOIL, the Getty subsidiary, and partially closed the Kuwait Oil
                            Company. (Telegram 1305 from Kuwait City, June 11; National Archives and
                            Records Administration, RG 59, Records of the Department of State,
                            Central Files, 1967–69, PET 17–1 ARAB) Embassy officials were convinced
                            that the Kuwaiti Government had no prior knowledge of the oil workers'
                            actions. Although the Kuwaitis did not acknowledge it, rumors circulated
                            of an imminent meeting of oil-producing Gulf states in Kuwait itself.

                        <p>That same day, June 10, Aramco's Brougham met in Dhahran with <persName
                                corresp="#p_YAZ1">Yamani</persName> who explained that an Iraqi
                            delegation had arrived after meeting with government representatives in
                            Kuwait. According to Brougham's account, the pro-Nasserite Iraqis were
                            urging oil producing countries to use “vigorous measures,” including
                            nationalization if necessary; <persName corresp="#p_YAZ1"
                                >Yamani</persName> believed that using the companies as “friendly
                            instruments” was a preferable alternative. Iraq agreed to join Kuwait
                            and Saudi Arabia at a meeting in Kuwait with oil executives the
                            following day. <persName corresp="#p_YAZ1">Yamani</persName> then said
                            that “he would probably do most of talking for the government side and
                            would probably make a number of harsh statements to the company
                            representatives. It would then be my [Brougham's] cue vigorously defend
                                <gloss target="#t_ARAMCO1">Aramco</gloss> and history of its

                                >USG</gloss>.” After detailing the points that Brougham should make,
                                “<persName corresp="#p_YAZ1">Yamani</persName> suggested at this

                            conveyed the bitterness of his colleagues “against US, <gloss

                        <p>Through British sources, the Embassy in London reported that a similar

                            they should oblige Israel to withdraw behind the borders which existed
                            before fighting started on 5 June. Until this objective is achieved Iraq
                            together with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and other Arab producing countries
                            will continue the suspension of oil exports.” (Telegram 10336 from

                            speculative is my belief that Kuwaitis and Saudis acted in collusion to

                            oil in Arab cause, knowing that report of meeting would reach Aref and

                                    undated 5-page assessment of the oil situation, plus two
                                    annexes, was attached to the source text under a June 12
                                    covering memorandum from Levy to <persName corresp="#p_KNB1"
                                        >Katzenbach</persName>. Levy speculated that the loss of oil
                                    exports for a significant time would not only result in
                                    “unmanageable” shortages for the West, but would also cause
                                    political instability in the Middle East oil producing states.
                                    He believed that the cessation of oil supplies was the only tool
                                    left to the Arabs and that they and their Soviet backers would
                                    not hesitate to use it. Sequestration and/or confiscation of
                                    U.S.-U.K. production facilities would be a real possibility. The
                                    political unity of the West would splinter, Levy felt, with a
                                    tendency for smaller nations to deal directly with the Arab
                                    states instead of looking to oil companies for oil. “While we
                                    must obviously try to maintain as long as possible a united
                                    political and oil front of the free world, we might, if the
                                    crisis should not cease very soon, have to decide whether our
                                    longer-term interests would not be better served by either
                                    closing our eyes to side deals or trying to handle such
                                    arrangements on an agreed upon common basis, say through some
                                    machinery of <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> which might
                                    provide for some ultimate responsibility to an organized group

                                    concessions.”</note>

                        <p>Even though I agree with the chamber of horrors that Walter has predicted
                            as being possible in the event of total oil denial, I doubt that total
                            oil denial will materialize, or that even the current oil denial program
                            will continue in the same intensity.</p>
                        <p>The most likely outcome to develop during the next few days will be the
                            assumptions of Case 2 or possibly even Case 3 in the attached paper (as
                            distinguished from Case 1 of total Arab oil denial). In other words,
                            even with the closure of the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean pipelines
                            and a total denial of oil from Iraq and with a denial to US and <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> destinations of oil from Saudi Arabia,
                            Kuwait and Libya, the shortfall in European and Japanese needs will be
                            quite manageable. The tanker problem, a component of this shortfall,
                            would be the more significant factor but I also assume that the Suez
                            Canal will not be kept closed for more than a few weeks since the
                            Soviets, as well as the rest of the world, will probably bring private
                            if not public pressures to reopen (Soviet tankers and freighters
                            carrying supplies to North Vietnam would have to be almost doubled in
                            number with the Canal closed). If the shortfall in Europe and Japan is
                            manageable and if the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> Oil
                            Committee contingency arrangements are activated, the dangers of side
                            deals by Italian, French, Japanese and other companies with the Arabs
                            are considerably reduced even though the Middle Eastern crisis might
                            very well push the Italian/Iraqi negotiations to a successful
                            conclusion.</p>
                        <p>I might live to regret this more optimistic prediction but I felt you
                            should have these views in view of Walter's feelings on the other

                                    companies in Libya would be asked to exert pressure on Western
                                    governments because of “tremendous pressure” from UAR and the
                                    Libyan man-in-the-street. “This comes within hours after

                                    Later that same day, the four largest oil companies operating in
                                    Libya, Oasis, Esso, Mobil, and Amoseas, were asked to meet with

                                    <persName corresp="#p_MK2">Muusa</persName> emphasized that
                                Baghdad meeting did not identify states aiding Israel militarily and
                                thus subject to export ban. To date, there has been no joint Arab
                                decision on this point,<note n="3" xml:id="d243fn3">According to an
                                    Embassy report, the Libyan Oil Minister told the company
                                    representatives on June 16 that “Libya, in contrast to other
                                    Arab oil producing countries, had ordered total shutdown of
                                    exports in order not to identify without positive proof any
                                    country as being involved on the side of Israel in recent
                                    conflict.” <persName corresp="#p_MK2">Muusa</persName> also
                                    indicated that the “reasonableness of U.S. in resolving this
                                    problem could well influence when and to what extent exports
                                    will recommence and future relations between Libyan Government
                                    and American oil companies operating in Libya.” In conveying the
                                    message to the U.S. Government, Esso's parent company, Standard
                                    Oil Company of New Jersey, stated its concerns: “In view of
                                    Jersey's tremendous investments and profit potential here and in
                                    other Arab producing countries feel strong approach to state
                                    this matter along above lines warranted.” The other oil
                                    companies received a similar message from the Minister.

                            <item>It is most important that Council action be based on 1960
                                arrangements because of allocation aspects of plan. We consider it
                                certain that pressures for U.S. participation in allocation
                                mechanism would be greater under approach not connected to 1960
                                agreements than under implementation of 1960 agreements, which are
                                European arrangement from which U.S. is exempted. Moreover,
                                advantage of allocating under previously agreed rules is an
                                important one.</item>

                                important to support giving of authority to U.S. companies to engage
                                in cooperative efforts. Conversely, indication that they doubt
                                seriousness of present situation makes it nearly impossible to
                                support conclusion that US faces emergency threatening its security

                                situation at length with FRG Economic Minister Schiller on June 19.

                                arrangements be worked out in <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>
                                for declaration of emergency or threat of emergency in order to
                                allow U.S. to permit companies to cooperate to meet oil situation.
                                Also said it was important that agreement be reached on Industry

                            <item>Schiller said he was becoming more and more concerned. He had seen
                                German press reports of rumors of rationing coming out of Paris. He
                                had earlier been operating on assurances from companies that stocks
                                were adequate. He now sees danger of a run on supplies in the FRG.
                                    <persName>Rostow</persName> said the question now was
                                cooperation between producers to arrange for efficient use of
                                tankers. <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> not talking of
                                allocation or rationing and we hope it will not have to. Cooperation
                                between Europe and the US is necessary, in order to minimize impact
                                of any shortfall in Europe.</item>

                            <item>Schiller said he saw declaration of emergency as connected with US
                                antitrust laws and not a concern for Europe. Then entered into
                                lengthy diatribe saying foreign oil companies had through rough
                                competitive methods taken over German energy market and now had a
                                responsibility to meet their commitments, from Western Hemisphere
                                sources if necessary. Should it become necessary to go ahead with
                                national energy policy in FRG (which French had already suggested),
                                everyone would be faced with an entirely new situation in the energy
                                field.</item>

                                <persName>Rostow</persName> said possibility of increasing supplies
                                from Western Hemisphere could be one item for discussion in industry
                                advisory group. Schiller expressed strong reservations on adverse
                                effect on Arab oil deliveries if faced with optical collaboration of
                                Western consumers. He favored something less apparent.
                                    <persName>Rostow</persName> impressed on him that <pb n="443"
                                    xml:id="pg_443" facs="0473"/>Western cohesion would have a
                                beneficial effect on conservative oil producers since it would
                                strengthen their hand in arguing that Nasser was damaging Arab
                                interests and would show that hard Arab line not likely to succeed.
                                On the other hand if we do not have a common stand, we will be
                                picked off one by one. Added that convening of industry group hardly
                                likely to be major political event, either way.</item>

                            <item>FRG Economics State Secretary Schoellhorn said FRG could accept
                                any of three proposed approaches to question but wanted to work out
                                something satisfactory to both US and France. Schiller said he was
                                concerned both with domestic impact in FRG and also with impact on
                                Arabs. He said FRG in very weak position. He could not say what
                                cabinet would decide, but he favored second alternative because of
                                domestic and Arab reaction. He reiterated his view that companies
                                who conquer market must accept responsibilities. If not, everyone is
                                going to say FRG must move in French direction. This would be a
                                point of no return. FRG must have oil however much he personally
                                opposed action by Government. He feared this entire process will
                                escalate to rationing, controls and Government intervention.</item>

                                crisis not to US but to Europe. We are ready to do our part by
                                joining in contingency planning. This seems to us only simple
                                prudence. If Germany and other <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>
                                members believe there is no real danger we hope they are right. But
                                should Iraq and above all Libya—which is in bad political
                                shape—remain closed down, there will be a serious problem. Need to
                                reroute tankers around Cape plus failure to act so far mean that
                                effective European stocks not much over 30 days.</item>

                                problem which does not immediately affect us and in which we need

                            <item>It is not clear to me either, whether and why in my further
                                discussions with the Germans here, I should be urging them to accept
                                an <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> resolution in terms of
                                “emergency,” which they have made clear they find distasteful. I
                                would want to avoid a situation analogous to that with regard to the
                                maritime declaration, where the Embassy and the Department were out
                                of phase, i.e. the Department was telling the German Embassy that
                                the declaration was still under consideration while we—as was
                                obvious—were telling them it had been overtaken by events. Insofar
                                as I understand the issues, a U.S. Government finding that an
                                emergency situation exists with respect to the supply and transport
                                of oil should be sufficient to meet our U.S. anti-trust problem. If
                                this is so, we should let the companies then get on with the job,
                                and give them every encouragement and help to meet their obligations
                                in Europe—as they will from the standpoint of their own interests
                                very much wish to do—without prolonging further politically divisive
                                arguments.</item>

                            <item>Question of apportionment is premature, as Europeans have
                                recognized to the point of insistence. Supply of oil to Europe at
                                this moment is primarily function of tanker availabilities rather
                                than oil at shipping points. In fact, production of oil has been
                                slowed by unavailability of tankers to carry it.</item>

                            <item>One long-time constant in French energy policy is to secure
                                maximum energy independence. This is why France took steps to impose
                                three month storage requirement, build up French flag tanker fleet,
                                and invest heavily in Algerian oil, leaving her in much better
                                position face current crisis than most other European countries.
                                Embassy has previously reported French reluctance, in framing its
                                long-term supply security plans, to take into consideration possible

                            <item>Retention of as much independence as possible appears to be
                                important element in current French attitude. Thus, initial French
                                position special meeting <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> Oil
                                Committee was non-participation, when French supply prospects
                                appeared relatively favorable. French attitude toward cooperation
                                began to change a few days later, when French realized that Libya
                                and Iraq might not resume exports for some time, leaving France with
                                50 percent normal crude receptions for indefinite period. French
                                appear to realize now that even if Libyan exports do resume in near
                                future it may happen only gradually, and instability in Libya might
                                result in second shut-down. Thus, the limits of French oil
                                independence in current crisis are now clearly visible, and we may
                                hope (unless consideration of high policies intervene) for
                                corresponding degrees of French cooperation in <gloss

                            <item>Another important element in French attitude of course has been to
                                preserve her existing crude sources in Arab producing countries,
                                particularly Algeria. However, Embassy as yet seen no indication of
                                French intention to go beyond this consideration and use current
                                crisis to poach on US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> company
                                concessions. Ensor of Mobil Oil regional office London recently
                                called on us to discuss this point. Such an effort is indeed
                                possible particularly on the part of <gloss target="#t_ERAP1"
                                    >ERAP</gloss>, whose crude sources still almost exclusively

                                that from outset of crisis, French petroleum press has rejected
                                “poaching”. Thus, knowledgeable daily bulletin De l'Industrie
                                Petrolliere on June 14 stated French Government had no intention of
                                breaking with other Western powers on petroleum, citing French

                                seem against the French undermining legal framework under which
                                their companies have recently attained worldwide crude production
                                greater than internal French consumption, in exchange for a shaky

                                French would then have some scope at least to fill in gaps until

                                oil. Many reasons for this can be cited, but three specific points

                            <item>The current situation in the Middle East does not parallel that of
                                1957, as is often claimed both here and in Europe with the
                                accompanying comment that the oil companies lived through the crisis
                                of 1957 and they will live through this one. The present situation
                                is significantly different. In 1957 the U.S. Government stood
                                absolute in its position against aggression. In that conflict it was
                                really on the side of the Arabs versus Israel. We were forcing
                                Israel back, we were taking a position in opposition to the French
                                and the British, and one which was favorable <pb n="453"
                                    xml:id="pg_453" facs="0483"/>to the Arabs. This position was
                                stated absolutely unequivocally, condemning the British, the French
                                and the Israelis, and leaving no question as to where the U.S.
                                stood.</item>

                            <item>Developments in recent weeks, and particularly in recent days,
                                have been working against the interests of the U.S. Government in
                                the Middle East as far as the retention of oil properties is
                                concerned. The friendly Arab states are encountering difficulty in
                                maintaining their position against the constant criticism of the
                                U.S. Government by the hostile states. An example is the problem the
                                Saudi Arabian Government is having in maintaining its position,
                                which is essentially friendly, against the demands of such
                                unfriendly countries as Iraq, which are urging the expulsion of
                                Americans and the nationalization and expropriation of the
                                American-owned companies. Lebanon is having similar troubles with
                                Syria. Lebanon would like to open the port of Sidon, get the Tapline
                                into operation again, and ship oil from the east through the
                                Mediterranean. However, partly because she took little part in the
                                war, whereas Syria suffered greatly, Lebanon does not want to
                                antagonize another Arab state. Public indoctrination by Radio Cairo
                                is placing the heads of basically friendly Arab regimes in a
                                position where they cannot speak out publicly for fear of the
                                indignation of the masses which, whipped up by Cairo propaganda,
                                might even cause the overthrow of such governments.</item>

                            <item>A very important point is that the friendly consuming
                                countries—the European countries, the U.K., and the Asian states—are
                                confronted with shortages, rationing, and higher prices which they
                                blame on U.S. Government policy. Whereas some 10 or 15 years ago
                                these countries were living on coal as their principal source of
                                energy, in the succeeding period they have converted their economic
                                life to one entirely dependent on oil. They claim that now their
                                source of energy supply is through American interests, that
                                obviously American interests are controlled and affected by U.S.
                                Government policy, and that therefore their economic life is
                                actually tied to U.S. Government policy. In reviewing this
                                dependence and considering what they should do, they are thinking of
                                nuclear energy and alternate sources of energy in the Middle East—a

                            <item>The background of the Israel-Aqaba deal has been forgotten and is
                                not being revived in the memory of the Arabs. A very important point
                                should be recalled on this matter. In order to meet Arab demands,
                                the Israelis pulled back from the Straits of Tiran and the Sinai
                                Peninsula. The U.S. negotiated an arrangement in which the quid pro
                                quo was that Israel move back to her former borders in return for
                                access to the Gulf of Aqaba. This is all forgotten now, and the
                                Arabs believe that we sponsored a great concession on their part to
                                Israel. Actually the reverse is true, and when the issue was argued
                                in the United Nations, our Ambassador was very weak on this point.
                                This point should be surfaced.</item>

                            <item>Experience with the functioning of executive committees here
                                suggests that our desire for flexibility and the retention of the
                                maximum number of options has left doubts in the minds of the Arabs
                                and of our friends in Europe as to what our true intentions are.
                                These doubts are being exploited by both sides. As a result, the
                                resentment of the Arabs toward the U.S. is intensifying whereas
                                their resentment towards the U.K. is lessening. Brown's speech was
                                no accident, no slip of the tongue. And Wilson's rather meager
                                attempt to pacify certain critics by his discussion on the floor of
                                Parliament was rather unconvincing, and certainly received no very
                                wide circulation, particularly in the Middle East.</item>

                                countries are growing concerned that their economic life is
                                dependent on U.S. oil money, and therefore on U.S. Government
                                policy, and they are therefore meddling in this situation.</item>

                            <item>Current statistics show that the reserves in Western Europe are
                                down to an estimated 30–40 days as of June 30th, as compared to the
                                60–70 days, and are going down quite fast. Tanker rates are up
                                100–200 from what they were a month ago. The deficits are forecast
                                to continue at least until the Suez Canal is opened because there
                                are simply not enough tankers to make the long trip around the Horn.
                                It takes 68 days for a tanker to make the round trip from the
                                Persian Gulf to Europe, as against 22–24 days through the Canal.
                                Although there was some excess tanker capacity before the crisis, it
                                just cannot carry the added load.</item>

                                deficit is of the order of a million and a half barrels a day, which
                                is enough to cause all kinds of trouble. The pipelines are down and
                                the Saudi Arabian Government has declared that it will ship no oil
                                through the trans-Arabian pipeline as long as it runs through
                                occupied territory, namely through a part of Syria now occupied by
                                the Israelis. Until the Israelis pull back to their former border
                                there is no prospect, under the present policy, of a resumption of
                                shipment through this channel.</item>

                                loss of revenue, and both the Government and the labor leaders want
                                to resume shipments for this reason. However, they are having
                                internal labor troubles—the constant harangue by Radio Cairo is

                            <item>The Europeans are definitely making carefully guarded overtures to
                                all of the oil-producing Arab countries, pointing out that should
                                the latter be forced to take over American oil properties, they can
                                depend on the Europeans for assistance. This information comes in
                                many, many ways from apparently rather good sources, [<hi

                                The situation is very different from 1957, when none of these
                                countries had the capability to enter the oil business, and
                                therefore the Arab oil-producing states do not have to look back at
                                the tragedy of Iran after Mossadeq expropriated the oil and
                                production was shut off completely because of lack of capability.
                                Now the Arabs can move, although with some considerable
                                inconvenience, most particularly in transportation.</item>

                            <item>This brings up some ideas about possible U.S. Government action
                                that will help. First, the Government should put more pressure on
                                Texas and Louisiana to increase the allowables for the East Coast,
                                and thus permit diversion to Europe of oil bound for the U.S. from
                                the Persian Gulf. Steps taken hitherto by the Texas and Louisiana
                                petroleum authorities have been very niggardly in increasing their
                                allowables. This is understandable because it is very difficult to
                                cut back the allowables at a later date once they turn those valves
                                open. Furthermore there is a unique situation because some of the
                                oil companies in the Louisiana and Texas oilfields have installed
                                pipelines and pumping facilities capable of handling only their
                                present allowables, whereas others have facilities to handle their
                                total potential production. An increase of allowables would thus put
                                some companies at a competitive disadvantage. The companies are
                                trying to straighten this out themselves <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456"
                                    facs="0486"/>and this action could account for several hundred
                                thousand barrels daily.</item>

                            <item>The second thing the U.S. Government can do is emphasize a
                                balanced position in its statements. This should come through
                                clearer and louder than it does because the attitude of the press,
                                radio, and television is such as to make government pronouncements
                                appear oriented toward Israel. As an example, the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >New York Times</hi> published an article three or four days ago
                                stating that the U.S. is resuming aid to Israel. This went through
                                the Middle East like wildfire. The article didn't say one word about
                                the fact that a few days earlier we had resumed aid to two or three
                                Arab states. We must be sure that our official statements come out
                                loud and clear and represent a very balanced position because there
                                is a certain amount of brainwashing going on by the press.</item>
                            <label>17.</label>
                            <item>The third action the U.S. can take is to come up with some clear
                                and unequivocal statements on the question of territorial
                                aggrandizement through military action. While this represents our
                                policy, we have equivocated somewhat. This is one of the items of
                                flexibility and options on which we have to bear down a little more
                                thoroughly than we have. The background of the 1957 Aqaba transit
                                arrangement should be recalled, probably privately, in every Arab
                                capital in order to make it clearly understood that what was done at
                                that time was done in the Arab interest, and that the story has
                                since been twisted around as something done in the Israeli interest.
                                The concession to Israel to permit their shipping to go through the
                                Gulf was very small compared to what the Arabs wanted, which was to
                                get the Israelis out of the Sinai, out of the Straits of Tiran, out
                                of the Gaza Strip, and back behind their lines.</item>

                            <item>Finally, we must guard against the Europeans taking advantage of
                                our plight. Brown's speech was no accident, as said before. The
                                talks going on between the Economic Ministers with the European oil
                                representatives really represent a tremendous threat. These are the
                                realities of the situation as seen from the point of view of the
                                international oil companies.</item>

                                    political opposition to the Maaziq Cabinet. The Libyan
                                    Government was unconcerned about a general strike by oil workers
                                    but was concerned about sabotage, a threat made stronger by the
                                    fact that the oil industry's labor leadership “overlapped
                                    considerably” with those in opposition to the government.

                                Tripoli: almost complete absenteeism in Tripoli offices, significant
                                absenteeism at Es Sidra (Oasis) and Ras Lanuf (Mobil), some
                                confusion but little absenteeism at Marsa Brega (Esso), and
                                virtually no absenteeism in Benghazi offices and at Marsa Hareega

                        <p>My guess is that these two gentlemen are coming in not to talk about the
                            current oil problem, but to ask for U.S. public statements that they can
                            use with their friends in Saudi Arabia. Texaco at 30% and Mobil at 10%
                            are large partners in the Arabian-American Oil Company. The Saudi
                            Finance Minister, <persName corresp="#p_YAZ1">Yamani</persName>, is
                            coming to New York next week and my guess is that they would like to be
                            able to show him some U.S. statement or action for which they can claim
                            partial credit.</p>
                        <p>The fact is that we agree with their analysis in large part and would
                            like to make a statement that would have something in it for the
                            moderate Arabs this week, perhaps at the end of the General Assembly
                            debate. We have been drafting such a statement for several days and I
                            attach at Tab A the latest version.<note n="2" xml:id="d256fn2">Not
                                printed. No indication has been found that this statement was ever
                                delivered by the President.</note> What it aims to emphasize are
                            certain points that the Arabs need to hear, about withdrawal, Jerusalem,
                            and our opposition to the unilateral changes of frontiers, all in the
                            context of a re-affirmation of your basic June 19 statement.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d256fn3">See <ref target="#d252fn3">footnote 3, Document

                            friends of Israel, but I think nearly all of it would go down fairly
                            smoothly.)</p>
                        <p>In this situation I think you may want to take the lead with these people
                            and not let them think that they can crowd you. You might start by
                            telling them that right from the beginning you have had the moderate
                            Arabs high in your thoughts. Our five principles are in their real
                            interests and in their quiet moments they admit it. Moreover you have
                            talked with the Kuwait Foreign Minister and with King Hussein and with
                            Hassan of Morocco, and with just about anyone that
                                <persName>Rostow</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_BMG2"
                                >Bundy</persName> or anyone else forces you to stick on your
                            calendar. You have written letters to Saudi Arabia and Iran.</p>
                        <p>You seized the first opportunity to make a strong statement on Jerusalem,
                            (they may follow other oil men in telling us that our abstention <pb
                                n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0492"/>on the Pakistani resolution was
                            too bad) and you can pre-empt this one too by saying that we did our
                            damnedest to get the moderate Arabs to accept one little modification
                            that would have allowed us to support it and could not get any
                            cooperation out of them. Cooperation on these matters is a two-way
                            street.</p>
                        <p>I think you will want to give all this to them in a quiet and sympathetic
                            tone because the oil companies continue to behave quite well and they do
                            have a case. But it is also true that the moderate Arabs will always
                            have a sore point as long as their fundamental grievance is that we are
                            not directly arrayed against Israel.</p>
                        <p>Finally, if you want to remind these gentlemen of the basic sentiments of
                            the American people on this issue you may find it helpful to have the
                            attached Harris poll.<note n="4" xml:id="d256fn4">Not found.</note>
                            Harris told me last week that in all his years as a pollster he had
                            never seen a more sweeping and definite registration of overwhelming
                            support for one side of a question. What is even more striking is that
                            the reservations of the American people are precisely those which we
                            ourselves have registered—on Jerusalem and on refugees.</p>

                        <p>With Dr. Alirio A. Parra, Venezuelan Director of Petroleum Economy</p>
                        <p>I believe Tony Parra has traveled more in Arab countries and has more
                            contacts among the Arab leaders than any other Latin American. He gave
                            me the following information today, for the most part in response to my
                            questions: <list>
                                <item>—Venezuela is naturally taking advantage of the Middle East
                                    crisis to maximize its oil revenues, but much of the added
                                    income will be absorbed by the bureaucracy. The Government now
                                    maintains that 30% of oil revenues go to economic and social
                                    development projects, but no one can really trace these funds
                                    and it is probably a much smaller percentage. Minister of
                                    Finance Benito Paul Losada intends to “sterilize” (I suppose
                                    that means segregate) the windfall profits to be used for future
                                    contingencies, but other Government officials are already
                                    planning to use them in current and expanded programs.</item>
                                <item>—The Iraqis recently asked Venezuela to curtail its petroleum
                                    shipments to the West. This was a bi-lateral representation, not
                                    made through the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
                                    (Parra left the impression that no other Arab countries had made
                                    similar requests.)</item>
                                <item>—But “the Arabs have not learned their lesson.” They plan to
                                    resume fighting with Israel as soon as they are armed and ready.
                                    They are almost constitutionally incapable of sitting at a
                                    conference table with the Israelis.</item>
                                <item>—From the earliest days of the Arab-Israeli crisis, the Saudis
                                    openly told the diplomatic corps—including the Venezuelan
                                    Ambassador in Jidda—that of course they would permit oil
                                    shipments to go to the West, despite the announced embargo. Only
                                    the Iraqis are naive enough to believe what the Egyptians tell
                                    them and to do what Nasser says.</item>

                                    stocks had been drawn down by 19 days—about one-third of the
                                    on-hand supply—and the British stocks were down by 28 days. Some
                                    countries were already experiencing shortages of naphtha and
                                    fuel oil. (Department of State, E Files: Lot 71 D 84, FSV

                            in large part due to the prompt response of the US to the emergency, in
                            the form of emergency measures and increased crude availabilities, and

                        <p>Herr Kling of the Economics Ministry (Deputy Assistant Secretary) has
                            confirmed information given us by the Bonn representative of Esso, A.G.
                            to the effect that the crisis point in the German oil supply situation
                            has been passed, and that supplies currently and for the foreseeable
                            future are adequate for normal operations. There is, consequently, no
                            present intention of permitting draw-downs of mandatory reserve stocks
                            of crude oil or products. Both sources said that there have not as yet
                            been any reported receipts of Libyan oil, although Kling pointed out
                            that the government is not asking any questions as to the country of
                            origin of oil entering the FRG via pipeline; it is permitting all Middle
                            East oil to be declared as “Arab State” oil. Country of origin
                            statistics will therefore have a permanent gap for the current year.</p>
                        <p>Kling highly praised the performance of the companies during the past
                            weeks in providing a continuing flow of crude through cooperation <pb
                                n="469" xml:id="pg_469" facs="0499"/>and organization. If the
                            situation continued as at present, the perennial claim of the coal
                            interests that only German coal can be relied upon as a safe form of
                            energy will be deprived of validity. This would clear away one obstacle
                            to the reduction of German coal production capacity and the extension of
                            the duty-free coal import quota.</p>

                        <p>On July 24, 1967, as the crisis abated, Iraq announced that it would
                            resume shipments to all countries except the United States, United
                            Kingdom, and West Germany. (Item for the <persName corresp="#p_KNB1"

                            Files: Lot 71 D 84, FSV Facilitative Service—1967) But the major
                            suppliers to the United States continued to hold back due to fears of
                            the political climate in the Arab world. When questioned, Saudi Oil
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_YAZ1">Yamani</persName> told U.S.
                            officials that the U.S. position at the United Nations was making it
                            difficult for Saudi Arabia to resume normal shipments: “<persName

                                >Muusa</persName> confirmed to Embassy officials that his country
                            had resumed direct export of oil to West Germany after the company
                            agreed not to publicize the shipments. He explained that resumption of
                            direct shipments to the United States and United Kingdom was still
                            unlikely: “Indirect shipments via Canada and Ireland being encouraged,
                            however.” According to <persName corresp="#p_MK2">Muusa</persName>, the
                            oil producers were unhappy that Arab Foreign Ministers had referred a
                            decision on a proposal for a 3-month total oil boycott to all Arab
                            states rather than just exporters. (Telegram 568 from Tripoli, August
                            10; ibid., PET 17–1 LIBYA) Despite the boycott, Abu Dhabi was exporting
                            to the United Kingdom, and Bahrain was shipping to both the United
                            States and the United Kingdom, while Shell was about to begin
                            unrestricted production in Muscat and Oman. (Circular airgram CA–1232,

                        <p>On September 1 the Arab Heads of State Conference in Khartoum adopted a

                                    consider accepting conditions of life which have the effect of
                                    declaring to the whole world their impotence and their
                                    ineptitude. The pain caused by embarrassment over their exposure
                                    is still sensitive, and they seek alternatives which would
                                    eliminate their discomfiture. The signs are all too few that
                                    Arabs will see the light as we see it or will reverse their
                                    stated policies.” The briefing memorandum also includes an
                                    analysis of the situation in each of the Arab states. (National

                            the oil producers when the Secretary General of <gloss target="#t_OPEC1"
                                >OPEC</gloss> proposed to move the organization's scheduled
                            September meeting from Vienna to Beirut. Saudi Arabia concurred in the
                            proposal, but Venezuela objected on the grounds that “Beirut venue would
                            tend to inject politics into what should be strictly non-political
                            conference.” The Venezuelan Ambassador in Saudi Arabia told U.S.
                            officials that “Venezuela has <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473" facs="0503"
                            />been subjected to considerable amount of Arab pressures re supporting
                            Arab position in Israel and re participating in Arab embargo on oil
                            shipments to US.” He stated that Venezuela had made it “very clear” that
                            it would not embargo oil shipments to the United States and that its
                            “association with Arab states in <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>
                            must continue to be on strictly non-political plane.” (Telegram 789 from

                        <p>At the <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> summit, which was held in
                            Rome, a split between Iraq and Libya on one side and Iran and Venezuela
                            on the other became apparent. Telegram 1506 from Rome, September 20,
                            reported that an Iranian Embassy source confirmed that “effort was made
                            to get non-Arab members agreement to limit their output in future to
                            assist Arabs at appropriate time in putting pressure on West European
                            customers. Stated that Iran flatly rejected all such suggestions as did
                            Venezuela.” Also, “In discreet manner, source implied that Iran had not
                            and would not participate in politically motivated boycott actions and
                            was pleased with the increase in offtake from Iran which situation since
                            June had brought about.” (Ibid.) The Embassy in Jidda reported that the
                            Venezuelan Ambassador in Saudi Arabia believed that the prime mover
                            behind the <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> summit was Saudi Oil
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_YAZ1">Yamani</persName> who tried to make
                            it “appear united Arab effort.” The Venezuelan Ambassador described the
                            “basic aim of Arab states as deriving sufficient extra revenue from
                            companies to offset new subsidies to 'victims of Israeli aggression.'”

                        <p>In late October reports emerged in the press that <persName
                                corresp="#p_YAZ1">Yamani</persName> was advocating the formation of
                            an association of Arab oil exporting countries. While noting that they
                            had not yet had the opportunity to meet with him, Embassy officials
                            reported that “In recent months the concept that petroleum should become
                            an instrument not only of economic policy but also of international
                            political policy has gained strength, even though Arab efforts this
                            summer to influence the United States and certain European countries
                            through a partial embargo on oil proved generally ineffective.” (Airgram

                            10 that it did not foresee Free World petroleum supply difficulties or a

                            The principal conclusions of the Committee's report are: <list>
                                <item>—There will be no Free World shortage of crude oil or refining
                                    capacity in the fourth quarter of 1967 and the first quarter of
                                    1968.</item>
                                <item>—Tanker tonnage during this period will be tight but adequate
                                    to meet requirements.</item>
                                <item>—The opening of Tapline, a pipeline that originates in Saudi
                                    Arabia and terminates in Lebanon, as well as the easing of
                                    destination restrictions by Arab nations, will continue to
                                    provide additional petroleum supply flexibility.</item>
                                <item>—There is no need for emergency Federal action to meet Free
                                    World requirements at the present time.</item>
                                <item>—No further analysis of the first quarter of 1968 is required
                                    unless there is some significant change in the present
                                    situation.</item>

                        </p>
                        <p>The committee estimated that Free World petroleum demand in the fourth
                            quarter of 1967, excluding the United States and Canada, will be
                            19,150,000 barrels per day while crude oil production is estimated at
                            20,230,000 barrels per day—an increase of 9.7 per cent over the third
                            quarter. The committee estimated first quarter 1968 Free World petroleum
                            demand at 19,500,000 barrels daily, an increase of 1.8 per cent over the
                            fourth quarter, and crude production at levels fully adequate to meet

                        <p>The Arab World's three leading oil producers, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and
                            Libya, signed an agreement in Beirut on January 9, 1968, establishing an
                            Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (<gloss
                                target="#t_OAPEC1">OAPEC</gloss>), which will have its headquarters
                            in Kuwait. We are enclosing Middle East Economic Survey's report
                            (January 12)<note n="3" xml:id="d268fn3">Not printed.</note> on the
                            establishment of the new organization; MEES also reports the major
                            provisions of the <gloss target="#t_OAPEC1">OAPEC</gloss> charter.</p>
                        <p>During the press conference that followed the signing ceremony, Saudi
                            PetMin <persName corresp="#p_YAZ1">Yamani</persName> confirmed that
                            neither Algeria nor the UAR would be eligible for membership in the new
                            group, as would, on the other hand, Qatar, Abu Dhabi, and Bahrain.
                                <persName corresp="#p_YAZ1">Yamani</persName> pointed out that the
                            charter provision on membership states that petroleum must constitute
                            the principal and basic source of income for member-states. Although not
                            specifically mentioned by <persName corresp="#p_YAZ1">Yamani</persName>,
                            Syria would also be left outside <gloss target="#t_OAPEC1"
                            >OAPEC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>As for membership and the rationale for establishment of the new
                            grouping, MEES concludes that the three charter members believed “the
                            main responsibility for policy decisions on Arab oil should rest with
                            those who actually produce it and are utterly dependent on this one
                            source of revenue.” As we noted in our A–557, Saudi, Kuwaiti, and Libyan
                            frustration with Middle East oil policy decisions following the June war
                            probably gave considerable impetus to their decision to form <gloss
                                target="#t_OAPEC1">OAPEC</gloss>. Indeed, Iraq's refusal to become a
                            charter member of the new group substantiates this view, i.e., whereas
                            Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Libya wanted to establish a more moderate
                            group (without <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0506"/>the likes of
                            Syria, the UAR, and Algeria), Iraq decided not to join the new group and
                            indicated it would prefer to coordinate its oil policy under the aegis
                            of the Arab League, which of course includes more radical elements than
                            the new <gloss target="#t_OAPEC1">OAPEC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The commercial and economic nature of the new organization is also worthy
                            of note; as <persName corresp="#p_YAZ1">Yamani</persName> stated during
                            his press conference, <gloss target="#t_OAPEC1">OAPEC</gloss> will be

                        <p>The need for increased food production and the problem of rapid
                            population growth in the developing world became linked as foreign
                            policy issues during the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration.
                            These issues were comparatively new ones, which had previously been left
                            primarily to private citizens, universities, and institutions such as
                            the Rockefeller Foundation, the Ford Foundation, and The Population
                            Council. President Eisenhower discussed population growth in December
                            1958 and remarked that “something drastic” had to be done to solve the
                            problem, but he “certainly did not know how to get started on this
                            solution and he furthermore could not himself get it started.” See <ref

                            knowledgeable decision-makers. In October 1963, only 4 years after his
                            earlier statement, former President Eisenhower said: “The time has come,

                                problems of population are among the most critical now facing
                                mankind. Hardest hit are the two-thirds of the world's people who
                                live in the developing countries, but all of us are vitally
                                affected. Here at home our growing population presents us with
                                problems of urban congestion and sprawl, of relocation of industry
                                and political reapportionment, of mass higher education, of leisure
                                and outdoor recreation, of voluntary fertility regulation, of
                                immigration policy, of economic growth—all basic to the realization
                                of the Great Society. Abroad in our efforts to aid the developing
                                countries, we are confronted with population growth at a rate
                                unprecedented in human history—a rate that threatens to defeat the

                            measures for dealing with the population problem. At bottom, the issue
                            is whether a Presidential Commission would advance—or delay and

                                at the conference, in which he explained that statesmen “cannot

                                discoveries in technology, biology, nuclear physics, and space.” He
                                also clearly enunciated the new threats to peace and security: “In
                                Pacem in Terris John XXIII returned to a theme he had discussed in
                                Mater et Magistra when he stated: ‘Given the growing interdependence
                                among peoples of the earth, it is not possible to preserve lasting
                                peace if glaring economic inequality among them persists.' If
                                control of nuclear weapons is a central issue in improving relations
                                between East and West, accelerating the economic development of new
                                nations is essential to harmony between North and South.” Humphrey
                                spoke of the need for social justice: “Those who have been ‘more
                                blessed with this world's goods' must heed the Pope's plea to assist
                                ‘those political communities whose citizens suffer from poverty,
                                misery and hunger and who lack even the elementary rights of the
                                human person.' We must do this out of compassion—for we are our
                                brother's keeper. And we also do it out of self-interest as well—for
                                our lot is their lot, our future their future, our peace their
                                peace. This planet is simply too small for the insulation of the
                                rich against turbulence bred of injustice in any part of the world.”

                            the President is inclined to attend, by all means I would not discourage

                            could be as effective in raising per capita output as the other 99%.</p>
                        <p>The above figures are just one good economist's.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d272fn2">Komer sent the studies to which he is referring to
                                Bill Moyers the next day. They include two papers by RAND economist
                                Stephen Enke, “Economic Programs to Prevent Births” and “Lower Birth
                                Rates—Some Economic Aspects,” as well as summaries of recent polls
                                concerning birth control. (Memorandum from Komer to Moyers, April
                                28; ibid.)</note> However, even if they're off somewhat, there's no
                            doubt of the rapidly declining cost of population control because of new
                            devices. This could have immense significance for areas where we are
                            investing massive amounts of development capital—all of Latin America,
                            India, Pakistan, Turkey (to take just our biggest clients). The process
                            of getting these countries to the stage of self-sustaining growth, <hi

                                on us</hi>—could be greatly foreshortened.</p>
                        <p>I'm not propagandizing for a big US push on the still sensitive issue of
                            birth control. Things are already moving in this field at a pretty good
                            pace. But the relevance of figures like the above to the achievement of
                            our foreign aid goals is so striking that you may want to consider ways
                            and means of gradually using our foreign aid more as an incentive to
                            major efforts in this field by the less developed countries themselves.
                            You might want to include this subject in your aid talks with Bill
                            Gaud.</p>

                                (<gloss target="#t_ICY1">ICY</gloss>), you appointed a Cabinet
                            Committee to coordinate the Government's participation. The private
                            sector was engaged through the United Nations Association.</p>
                        <p>In response to your public requests (excerpts enclosed),<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d274fn6">Not printed.</note> the Cabinet Committee and the
                            United Nations Association created joint committees on various areas of
                            international cooperation. We expect a number of the committee reports
                            will contain proposals worthy of consideration for your State of the
                            Union message. You will recall that this was discussed when you recently
                            joined us for a luncheon in the Department.</p>
                        <p>It may be desirable for you to release some of the recommendations before
                            the opening of the Conference. We plan to make specific suggestions to
                            this end.</p>
                        <p>We have developed the enclosed tentative program of the Conference which
                            would personally involve you, high government officials and
                            congressional leaders.</p>
                        <p>You would participate in the final plenary session of the Conference on
                            Wednesday, December 1, by receiving the reports and recommendations of
                            the Conference and making appropriate remarks. This would be followed by
                            an early evening reception at the White House.</p>
                        <p>The Congress passed a concurrent resolution<note n="7" xml:id="d274fn7"
                                >Senate Concurrent Resolution 36, agreed on June 22, 1965. (79 Stat.

                            program and designated six Senators and six Congressmen to attend the
                            Conference. Other legislators will also participate. We expect about
                            1200 top citizen leaders and 300 government officials to participate.
                            The Conference will, therefore provide you and the United States
                            Government with the opportunity to present graphically the efforts of
                            the Administration to achieve peace and cooperation in the world.</p>

                        <p>1. Jake Jacobsen has passed me your message, and I have not done anything
                            further on this matter until I could get back to you. But neither have I
                            issued any general stop order.<note n="2" xml:id="d275fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> had raised the issue
                                with the President in a memorandum on November 2: “At the outset,
                                let me say that while I don't blame you for your concern about the
                                number of White House Conferences, the record shows we are pretty
                                firmly committed to go through with this one as scheduled. In
                                addition to the fact that many leading private citizens have already
                                contributed much time and effort in preparation for the Conference,
                                the public record leaves us little room to maneuver.” (Ibid.)</note>
                            I want to do just what you want done, but I don't think I should cancel
                            or postpone this Conference without a definite decision from you. It is
                            now scheduled, by your repeated public affirmation, for November
                            29–December 1. No one short of the President should make any decision to
                            derail what the President has repeatedly ordered.</p>
                        <p>2. My memoranda to you have failed to speak adequately of the history of
                            all this. It began in 1964 after the UN General Assembly designated 1965
                            as International Cooperation Year. You gave that designation your
                            enthusiastic support.</p>
                        <p>(1) First in your June, 1964 speech at Holy Cross you said,</p>
                        <p>“I propose to dedicate this year to finding new techniques for making
                            man's knowledge serve man's welfare. …</p>
                        <p>“We intend to call upon all the resources of this great nation—both
                            public and private—to work with other nations to find new methods of
                            improving the life of man.”</p>
                        <p>(2) Then on October 2, 1964 you issued a Proclamation of International
                            Cooperation Year. The operating clauses of this Proclamation are as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>“Now, therefore, I, <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.
                                Johnson</persName>, President of the United States of America, do

                                <item>—proclaim the year 1965 to be International Cooperation Year
                                    in the United States of America;</item>
                                <item>—rededicate the Government of the United States to the
                                    principle of international cooperation; and</item>
                                <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0517"/>
                                <item>—direct the agencies of the Executive Branch to examine
                                    thoroughly what additional steps can be taken in this direction
                                    in the immediate future.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>I also call upon our national citizen organizations to undertake
                            intensive educational programs to inform their memberships of recent
                            progress in international cooperation and urge them to consider what
                            further steps can be taken.”</p>
                        <p>(3) On the same day you addressed a gathering of notables in the East
                            Room and made an eloquent and moving announcement of plans for a White
                            House Conference on International Cooperation:</p>
                        <p>[Here follow excerpts from the President's remarks on October 2; see <ref
                                target="#d274fn2">footnote 2, Document 274</ref>.]</p>
                        <p>(4) With that send-off, people went to work. On November 24, 1964, you
                            designated a Cabinet Committee under <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Dean
                                Rusk</persName> to prepare for the White House Conference.
                            Committees were formed on a whole range of topics, and the interest of
                            leading private citizens was engaged in a year of preliminary work. They
                            really are leading citizens, and I attach two pages of representative
                            names of those who have taken an interest in the Conference (Tab
                                A).<note n="3" xml:id="d275fn3">Not found.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>(5) On March 4, 1965, you received Bob Benjamin and gave the whole
                            undertaking another strong boost.</p>
                        <p>“On October 2, I proclaimed this twentieth anniversary year of the birth
                            of the United Nations as International Cooperation Year in the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>“I am highly pleased by the extent of voluntary support being given to
                            this observance by citizens throughout the country. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RBH1">Benjamin</persName>'s progress report this morning
                            was inspiring. I believe Americans today fully recognize that
                            international cooperation is the one sure way toward peace. The depth of
                            such citizen support is a source of strength for all of this nation's
                            policies and purposes.</p>
                        <p>“I am hopeful that the White House Conference on International
                            Cooperation which I have called for November 29 to December 1, can be a
                            landmark session. I hope the conference and the preliminary discussions
                            leading toward it can be a source of new and thoughtful evaluations of
                            what we can do in every major field of international cooperation.”</p>
                        <p>(6) Since then the wheels have been rolling. Thirty Committees of private
                            citizens have prepared reports which are now going to press. Invitations
                            have been printed. Committee and Panel Chairmen have arranged their
                            programs. A remarkable group of Americans have responded to the
                            challenge you gave their leaders in the East Room a year ago. All of
                            this can do good. Little if any of it can do harm. You started it in a
                            great speech. Why should it be stopped now?</p>
                        <pb n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0518"/>
                        <p>3. It may be that I have failed to respond to some special concern of
                            yours. Here are some cases of possible objections with brief
                            answers.</p>

                            can think of no reason whatsoever for cancellation, and the only good
                            reason for a postponement would be to allow you to take a larger part in
                            the Conference after your convalescence. Such a postponement can readily
                            be arranged if you wish—though it might raise unnecessary questions

                        <p>The White House Conference on International Cooperation was held November
                            29–December 1, 1965, in Washington. President <persName

                                >Humphrey</persName> read a message from the President at the
                            opening session on November 29.</p>
                        <p>In his message to the conference, which the President called “a Town
                            Meeting of the leaders of the Nation,” he urged the participants to seek
                            “new ways to raise the world's millions up from poverty, new policies to
                            conserve and develop the world's resources, new methods to rid the world
                            of destructive disease; new means to increase commerce between nations;
                            new safeguards against the overriding danger of war; new avenues to
                            world peace.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the

                        <p>The administration found that many of the conference's reports
                            contradicted stated policy or supported programs targeted for
                            extinction. According to an early Bureau of the Budget reaction
                            memorandum, the report on population—a “tricky and sensitive subject”
                            called for more extensive and dramatic U.S. action, when the current
                            U.S. policy was “not to be doctrinaire and to use soft approaches.”
                            Regarding the human rights report, another memorandum noted: “This
                            report proposes to press forward the U.S. into international cooperation
                            in human rights on a broad front. The efficacy of the recommendations
                            involves judgments of U.S. domestic political aspects and how far U.S.
                            goes in surrendering sovereignty or binding its internal affairs by
                            international agreements. These are ticklish problems.” (Memoranda from

                        <p>White House staff members hoped that the conference would be forgotten.
                            “The one outstanding piece of business left over from the <gloss

                                <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> on December 17, “is how
                            to organize (or scuttle) the follow-up. …Sisco has sent all the reports
                            to the Cabinet Committee requesting reaction to their recommendations by
                            22 December. So far the citizens' committees haven't done anything but
                            talk about organizing themselves to follow through. Sisco hopes a quick
                            informal reaction to the recommendations will pre-empt them. My sense is
                            that we want to keep communication informal and let it trail off.”

                        <p>In late 1965, as White House staff began to review the issue of
                            population, the State Department's population expert, Robert Barnett,
                            was asked to prepare an overview for White House use. Barnett reported,
                                “<persName corresp="#p_GK3">Gordon</persName> Chase (White House)
                            says it seems to be what was needed for the aid review now afoot over
                            there.” (Memorandum from Barnett to <persName corresp="#p_RBH1"
                                >Read</persName>, November 22, 1965; National Archives and Records

                            Files, 1964–66, SOC 13) After providing a historical overview stretching
                            back to the Eisenhower administration, Barnett set out a series of
                            principles by which U.S. Government policy could be guided. He made two
                            points. First, the United States could “treat the population problem
                            scientifically without anxiety that to do so will provoke obfuscating
                            ideological dispute as to propriety of that activity.” Second, the U.S.
                            Government “should advocate no specific or elaborate national policy
                            with respect to population questions beyond the policy of stating
                            readiness to respond to requests for help originating at home or in
                            foreign countries with needed resources, financial, scientific,
                            technical, and personnel.” (Ibid.)</p>
                        <p>In a series of major messages in the first 2 months of 1966, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> raised the issue and
                            followed these guidelines on at least six occasions. On January 20, in
                            an address in Independence, Missouri, he said: “The hungry world cannot
                            be fed until and unless the growth in its resources and the growth in
                            its population come into balance. Each man and woman—and each
                            nation—must make decisions of conscience and policy in the face of this
                            great problem. But the position of the United States of America is
                            clear. We will give our help and support to nations which make their own
                            decision to insure an effective balance between the numbers of their
                            people and the food they have to eat.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers

                                    >Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>, 1966</hi>, Book I, page 42) He
                            spoke again on February 1: “The United States cannot and should not
                            force any country to adopt any particular approach to this problem. It
                            is first a matter of individual and national conscience, in which we
                            will not interfere.” (Ibid., page 119)</p>
                        <p>A National Security Action Memorandum, dated November 21, 1966, and
                            annotated “draft not used,” includes a covering memorandum that urged
                            immediate action, but cautioned: “There are admittedly some tough issues
                            to be resolved, both in policy and in tactics. … There's also the
                            political question—whether pushing hard encourages opponents to fight
                            back when we might get just as far by moving ahead quickly. I gather
                            you've decided this is urgent enough to risk a fight. In any case, this
                            in-house shouldn't cause trouble.” The matter went no further. (Johnson

                            the Speaker urging vigorous implementation of Conference
                            recommendations. Important private citizens, greatly enthused by the
                            conference, are beginning to ask whether anything will come of it. Dick
                            Gardner will keep the issue alive with a book on the Conference this
                            fall.</p>
                        <p>Our problem is to lay the Conference to rest decently. We do not want to
                            perpetuate it. On the other hand, it would be a bad mistake to ignore
                            the Conference recommendations completely. Too many influential citizens
                            invested too much time, thought and energy. Ignoring their work would
                            unnecessarily antagonize some of our best foreign policy constituents.
                            Besides, there are some good ideas (maybe as many as 200 big and small)
                            among the recommendations, and we might as well take some credit for
                            them.</p>
                        <p>As I see it, there are three ways to handle this problem, making the most
                            of the sensible Conference recommendations and scrapping the useless
                            ones:</p>

                        <p>This would push implementation of recommendations down into the

                            ceremony. In my view, this would unnecessarily give the private people
                            who participated in the Conference—people who are basically sympathetic
                            with your foreign policy aims—a cause to say we are deaf to new

                            not prepared to act.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Course #3: A Compromise</hi>. The course I favor
                            (Budget Bureau and Doug Cater agree) is for you to assign an in-house
                            committee headed by <persName corresp="#p_SCL1">Charles
                                Schultze</persName> to review the Conference recommendations in the
                            context of preparing your FY 1968 budget and legislative program. You
                            might even assign one of the summer task forces this responsibility,
                            though it is mostly an in-house job since the outsiders have already had
                            their say. We would set this up with a simple memo to department and
                            agency heads (draft attached)<note n="4" xml:id="d278fn4">Not
                                found.</note> asking their cooperation. Then we could put out just
                            enough of a press release to show we are not letting these ideas
                            die.</p>
                        <p>My idea of the committee would be to include the Budget Director
                            (providing the staff work), Joe Califano (in connection with the
                            legislative program), myself and maybe one non-government participant we
                            could trust (to give the outsiders testimony that we have given their
                            ideas a fair shake). This would be mostly dressing up for public
                            consumption work Budget would be doing anyway in the normal budget
                            process. We would just give a little special attention to programs
                            recommended by the Conference so we could produce a good box-score next
                            January.</p>
                        <p>I think this is the least we can do. Burying this show as State
                            recommends risks a bad political backfire. Handling it this way would
                            give an appearance of honest White House attention without perpetuating
                            the Conference or associating you any further with its unpalatable
                            recommendations. There are enough good recommendations that I think we
                            could put together a pretty good story for you in January about how many
                            you have incorporated in your program. By good public relations, we
                            could create a glowing picture of your new efforts to tap good minds
                            everywhere.</p>
                        <p>I see this as complementing our new efforts to increase State Department
                            use of consultants. It is a one-shot deal to screen out good ideas from
                            one of the “[illegible] consultants” we have ever put to work. We will
                            not reassemble that group, so there is no conflict with our new program.
                            However, the image of giving their ideas full hearing <pb n="493"
                                xml:id="pg_493" facs="0523"/>would nicely complement announcement of
                            your new program to tap the best private thinking on a permanent (and
                            less cumbersome) basis.</p>
                        <p>There are other advantages in forcing the bureaucracy to follow through
                            on the conference recommendations and on the private contacts they
                            established during the conference. One of the big bottlenecks as we
                            begin adding an international dimension to the Great Society will be to
                            get the traditionally domestic departments like <gloss target="#t_HEW1"
                                >HEW</gloss>, Interior, and Justice to think in international terms
                            too. If we can perpetuate their contacts with internationally minded
                            private experts and make them think about international programs, we
                            will begin bringing them along into the foreign field. This would not
                            distort any existing or planned programs for expanding use of
                            consultants. It would just underscore their importance.</p>

                            problem. I agreed that this is true, but said that still the subject is
                            a sensitive one and still there is relatively little around the world in

                        <p>With these thoughts in mind, it has been suggested that it would give
                            encouragement and a real lift to world leaders generally if the heads of

                            under way or at least on the threshold of action, were to sign a joint
                            statement for worldwide release—a sort of manifesto of faith and belief.
                            Attached is a suggested draft of such a statement and a list of the
                            countries whose leaders we would like to interest in signing it.<note

                            race now being lost. He again stressed the need for concerted action to
                            produce more food and for the developing nations, especially the growing
                            number with food deficits, to undertake voluntary family planning

                            because of danger of famine or burden on economic progress—the

                            food production.</p>
                        <p>I would appreciate it if you would assure that all Country Directors,

                            developing nations be fully familiar with these instructions and give

                        <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJ3"
                            >Rielly</persName>:</p>
                        <p>You may have noted that all the polls show the American public to be
                            overwhelmingly in favor of birth control. This goes for Catholics as
                            well as non-Catholics.</p>
                        <p>People are increasingly concerned by the rapid deterioration of living
                            conditions in our country. Over-crowded cities, slums, mounting crime,
                            traffic congestion, polluted air and water, loss of space for
                            recreation, etc. Too many people!</p>
                        <p>And let us not overlook the fact that the burgeoning billions of hungry
                            people abroad will affect us here at home. We are feeding many of them
                            right now and the appeals today are as nothing compared with the demands
                            upon us in the not distant future when millions may be starving.</p>
                        <p>It is therefore fortunate that Catholic laymen generally do not go along
                            with the recent Bishops' injunctions against birth control quoted in a
                            reprint from <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi> enclosed.<note

                        </p>
                        <p>It is fortunate also that official Church attitudes do change, however
                            slowly. Masses may now be said in English, meat eaten on Fridays, nuns'
                            clothing modernized, etc.</p>
                        <p>Conscientious public servants meantime should realize that the people at
                            large applaud their efforts to stem the tide of humanity which threatens
                            to engulf us.</p>

                                time taken a deep interest in the issues of peace and world

                        <p>The Pontiff has repeatedly urged international collaboration between the
                            nations of the world because He sees in this a very valuable means for
                            advancing an environment in which peace can prevail. Economic assistance
                            and the interchange of technical knowledge will enable the emerging
                            nations to enter with honour and dignity into the family of nations and
                            will help immeasurably in dissipating suspicions. Richly endowed nations
                            will have to shoulder heavy burdens, but history will record for all
                            time their efforts to achieve understanding and respect, a preliminary
                            step towards world peace.</p>

                        <p>My understanding is that a principal reason why President <persName

                            endorsing our World Leaders' Statement on Population was that he felt
                            the group which had agreed to participate was not representative enough.
                            With this thought in mind and recognizing that the Statement would
                            obviously carry more weight if it should be signed by the leaders of

                                Populorum Progressio, was released on March 28. It acknowledged that
                                too frequently an “accelerated demographic increase adds its own
                                difficulties to the problems of development: the size of the
                                population increases more rapidly than available resources, and
                                things are found to have apparently reached an impasse.”</note>
                            although so ambiguously worded in places that I hesitate to try to
                            analyze it, seems to me (after consultation with a Catholic demographer
                            who was on the Papal Commission on birth control) to make at least three
                            statements of which may turn out to be of great importance.</p>

                            <item>It states plainly (“it is certain”) that public authorities can
                                intervene both “by favoring the availability of appropriate
                                information” and “by adopting suitable measures.” The statement that
                                public authorities can intervene is new and potentially of wide
                                applicability. It should open the way for United Nations, national,
                                state, and municipal authorities to provide appropriate
                                information—presumably, but not plainly, meaning birth control
                                information. They may also adopt “suitable measures”—a phrase
                                perhaps intentionally left vague but apparently intended to be
                                different from the “radical measures” that are rejected and may well
                                be interpreted to include provision of some kind of fertility
                                control program. There are two limitations on the “suitable
                                measures:” (a) They must be in conformity with “the moral law,”
                                which is not defined, but may refer to the standing doctrine on
                                birth control—or may not; and (b) They must respect the rightful
                                freedom of married couples, which is not a material limitation in
                                practice.</item>

                            <item>The statement very importantly repeats in plainer language some of
                                the revolutionary statements made by Vatican II: “It is for the
                                parents to decide … on the number of their children,” with four
                                considerations in mind: taking into account their responsibilities
                                toward God; taking into account their responsibilities toward
                                themselves—which presumably can mean their economic situation, the
                                health of the mother and other such factors; taking into account
                                their responsibilities toward the children they already have—which
                                again is an important factor of broad meaning; and taking into
                                account their responsibilities toward their community—again a new
                                factor not in Vatican II and possibly important in communities where
                                there are shortages of food, where economic growth is difficult and
                                where social progress will be held back by excessively large numbers
                                of children.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The statement qualifies all this decision-making by the parents with
                            another factor that was not stated by Vatican II: that the parents are
                            to make their decision “with full knowledge of the matter”— which might
                            be read to mean adequate information concerning the possibilities of
                            birth control.</p>
                        <p>The statement concludes with a limitation which is potentially broad in
                            that it says “they must” (and hence may) “follow the demands of their
                            own conscience.” This broad authority may be limited by the following
                            phrase which speaks of the “conscience” as “enlightened by God's law
                            authentically interpreted.” A footnote to this clause refers to one of
                            the Vatican II documents which refers to the statement of Pope Pius IX
                            in 1931 regarding “natural” means of birth control. It is perhaps
                            significant that the word “enlightened” is used—not such a word as
                            “governed.”</p>
                        <pb n="504" xml:id="pg_504" facs="0534"/>
                        <p>The fact that the entire statement is ambiguous in several places and
                            open to interpretation is itself important in giving flexibility to
                            officials, individuals and perhaps individual priests.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d285fn3">Commentators at the time interpreted the encyclical
                                as progressive. For example, the March 28 headline in the Washington
                                Evening Star read: “Pontiff Voices Eased View on Birth Control.”
                                This interpretation was shared by some observers in Latin American
                                countries as well. The Embassy in Caracas reported: “Liberal
                                Catholics in Venezuela have seen the Pope's statement as a new
                                opening or at least a willingness to continue further study of the
                                problem of birth control.” (Airgram A–735, April 8; National

                            Hickenlooper, and 17 other Senators supported an amendment to the
                            Foreign Aid Bill authorizing $50 million per year for 3 years “to
                            provide assistance for voluntary family planning programs in friendly
                            foreign countries and areas, on such terms and conditions as he (the
                            President) shall determine, to foreign governments, United Nations
                            specialized agencies, United States and foreign nonprofit organizations,
                            universities, hospitals, accredited health institutions, and voluntary
                            health or other qualified organization.” (AIDTO circular telegram 2417,
                            April 12, 1967; National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59,

                            a State Department analysis prepared in mid-1968 noted, policy
                            developments in population matters in the Executive Branch were “in part
                            led” by developments in Congress. (<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>

                            problem “the priority it deserves.” (Ibid.) The House Foreign Affairs
                            Committee agreed and urged that family planning be a central element of
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> activities: “In order to
                            counteract any possible tendency … to continue business as usual and to
                            regard family planning programs as a fringe operation, $50 million of
                            economic assistance funds have been set aside to be used only for this
                            purpose.” (Ibid.)</p>

                        <p>The Department believed that the discussion surrounding the amendment of
                            the Foreign Aid legislation, which ultimately passed as Title X,
                            signaled six major elements of policy favored by leaders of both parties
                            in Congress: <list>
                                <item>“1. The Congress is deeply concerned that present rates of
                                    population growth in many developing countries are seriously
                                    impeding efforts toward economic and social development and
                                    threaten serious food shortages in only a few years;</item>
                                <item>“2. The Congress wants the Executive Branch to move much more
                                    rapidly and effectively than it has in the past to provide
                                    assistance in this field to developing nations;</item>
                                <item>“3. The Congress is willing to provide greatly increased funds
                                    for this purpose and wants the funds used more liberally—even
                                    permitting grants to be made where loans are required for older
                                    programs;</item>
                                <item>“4. The Congress knows that the fundamental decisions for
                                    action can be made only by each developing nation itself and
                                    that the United States and other outside agencies can help only
                                    as we are wanted;</item>
                                <item>“5. The Congress would like to see U.S. program assistance
                                    conveyed as far as is reasonably practicable through United
                                    Nations and other multilateral channels and wants to see the
                                    widest practical involvement of private organizations;</item>
                                <item>“6. The Congress wants to be sure that U.S. aid goes only to
                                    programs where participation is voluntary and each individual is
                                    free to practice methods of family planning consistent with his
                                    or her beliefs.” (Ibid.)</item>

                            and discussed it with him two weeks ago, I doubt if you had a chance to
                                <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0536"/>read much of the text or to
                            go over it thoroughly. I am attaching a copy of the text together with
                            an article from the Times on it.<note n="3" xml:id="d287fn3">Neither

                        <p>The encyclical provoked a stronger reaction both here and in Europe than
                            most encyclicals do. The reason is clear: language is blunt and direct
                            both in its indictment of the status quo and in its prescription for the
                            future. It states clearly that no purely economic standard, whether
                            Marxist or capitalist, can be the ultimate guide to governing a society.
                            Because it condemned the evils of unrestrained capitalism and insisted
                            that private property and profit must be subordinated to a higher common
                            good, it was criticized by the Wall Street Journal as “warmed over
                            marxism.” Similar judgments were rendered by certain conservative
                            journals in Europe, particularly in Italy. They were further annoyed by
                            the fact that it does not discuss communism per se (just as the
                            encyclical Pacem in Terris<note n="4" xml:id="d287fn4">See <ref
                                    target="#d271">Document 271</ref>.</note> did not) but
                            concentrates instead on the problems arising from the disparities
                            involved between developed and underdeveloped nations.</p>
                        <p>In contrast to earlier encyclicals, the discussion focuses on the
                            propertyless nation rather than the propertyless class. The status of
                            the underdeveloped countries today is regarded as similar to the
                            proletariat in European nations a century ago. The situation will get
                            worse instead of better until action is taken. The Pope makes it
                            unequivocally clear that not only individuals have a moral obligation
                            but nations as well. Humanitarian aid is not enough, but rather “it is a
                            question, rather, of building a world for [where?] every man, no matter
                            what his race, religion or nationality, can live a fully given life,
                            freed from servitude imposed on him by other men or by natural forces
                            over which he has not sufficient control; a world where freedom is not
                            an empty word and where the poor man Lazarus can sit down at the same
                            table with the rich man.”</p>
                        <p>The implications of all this are very concrete for wealthy nations like
                            the United States and Western European powers. These countries must face
                            the explosive political questions of paying taxes to help developing
                            nations. Will we pay higher prices for imported goods from these
                            nations? Will we be willing to work out some alteration of our trading
                            policies to guarantee a fair and stable price for agriculture products
                            and raw material? These are of course some of the questions being
                            discussed at the Latin American Summit Conference in Punta del Este this
                                week<note n="5" xml:id="d287fn5">A meeting of the Latin American

                            United Nations every year. The President indicated a greater willingness
                            to consider these measures than we have previously done.</p>

                            of Churches and the National Council of Churches here, a concerted
                            effort will be made to change popular thinking precisely on these issues
                            discussed in the encyclical. It will be a long, slow process, resisted
                            by many vested interests here. But, if the prescriptions suggested in
                            this encyclical are ever to be followed, it will take a long-term
                            massive shift in public opinion before any legislative body will approve
                            a program implementing what the encyclical proposes. It is not so much
                            the cost—some one figured out that the Marshall Plan in total cost
                            roughly what the Vietnamese war takes for seven months. Rather one must
                            convince the public that it is just as worthy to spend money to build
                            nations as it is to spend it in a war.</p>
                        <p>I think you should probably plan to make one address on this subject
                            during the commencement season. The last time you gave a full speech on
                            this was at Fordham University two years ago (incidentally, the message
                            of the Fordham speech and the encyclical are almost identical—note

                        <p>The Vice President opened the conversation by commenting on what a
                            powerful document the Pope's encyclical on “The Development of
                                Peoples”<note n="2" xml:id="d288fn2">See <ref target="#d285"

                            Pope and he had been thinking about how one could best translate this
                            into action. We should not be content just to have it discussed for a
                            few weeks then dropped.</p>
                        <p>Monsignor <persName corresp="#p_GMJ1">Gremillon</persName> explained that
                            this is precisely what the Papal Commission on Justice and Peace in Rome
                            and the National Secretariat on Justice and Peace in Washington were set
                            up to do.<note n="3" xml:id="d288fn3">See <ref target="#d283">Document
                                    283</ref>.</note> He said that his own office was in Rome and
                            that Monsignor Bordelon was setting up an office in Washington under the
                            auspices of the United States Catholic Conference.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President wondered whether the energies of Vietnam could be
                            redirected and rechanneled into positive development avenues after the
                            war was over. He hoped this would be so but was not sure.</p>
                        <p>Monsignor <persName corresp="#p_GMJ1">Gremillon</persName> explained that
                            the whole effort to arouse and educate the consciences of people to the
                            problem of development must be strictly ecumenical. He explained that he
                            was in regular contact with his colleagues in the World Council of
                            Churches and only three weeks ago had visited Eugene Carson Blake in
                            Geneva. Blake was coming to Rome next week for further meetings. It
                            turned out that they were also cooperating regularly with the Russian
                            Orthodox Church. The Archbishop of Leningrad invited a group of 30
                            leaders from the World Council of Churches and from the Catholic Church
                            to come to a meeting in the Soviet Union sometime this year to discuss
                            the whole theory and doctrine of development. The Archbishop said not
                            only would this be very worthwhile world-wide, but would be immensely
                            helpful to them in Russia.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President stated that that is a most significant development. He
                            believed that leaders of some of the socialist countries should be
                            encouraged by certain parts of the Pope's recent encyclical because of
                            the sharp critique of certain forms of capitalism contained in it. This
                            does not necessarily apply to the United States, but it does apply to
                            capitalism in some areas.</p>
                        <p>Monsignor Bordelon suggested in that regard that one of the functions of
                            the Washington National Secretariat here is to serve as a vehicle for
                            communicating with the Vatican on issues of concern to the United States
                            or to any important segment of the United States public. For example,
                            the American business community has not really participated in the
                            writing of the recent encyclicals. As a result there really has been <pb
                                n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0539"/>no encyclical which elaborates
                            fully on the difference between the American private enterprise system
                            and this sort of laissez faire capitalism that the Pope condemns.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said he was concerned about the debasement of public
                            opinion in the United States today. This not only applies to
                            international affairs but to the poverty program, civil rights, as well
                            as foreign aid. Therefore, we have a great problem in trying to get
                            people to think about war on hunger, social justice and the other themes
                            discussed in the encyclicals Pacem in Terris and The Development of
                            Peoples. We would like to see people get aroused about this as well as
                            about the war. The United States Government is ultimately responsive to
                            public opinion. If public opinion on this issue changes, Government
                            policy will reflect the change. But, meanwhile, millions of people are
                            dying.</p>
                        <p>Monsignor <persName corresp="#p_GMJ1">Gremillon</persName> said that he
                            hoped what he was trying to organize would do precisely that. He told
                            the Vice President that at a meeting this week in Detroit, where he
                            talked about the encyclical and the problem of development, he discussed
                            the issue of developed nations contributing one percent of their gross
                            national product to foreign assistance. Walter Reuther, who was the
                            respondent on the platform, said he believed it should be two percent.
                            Monsignor Gremillon said that at the recent meeting of the Papal
                            Commission an idea was put forth by Barbara Ward to develop a “package
                            plan” among developed nations. They agreed to aim at $30 billion by
                            1970. This would be divided between the United States and Europe. Once
                            all developed nations agreed on a package there would be pressure put on
                            them to live up to the commitment. It would clearly be a multilateral
                            effort, involving not only governments and other groups but church
                            groups, professional groups and a wide variety of lay associations.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said that the more the United States becomes involved
                            in military programs the greater the need for the United States to be
                            involved in programs in the field of social justice overseas. He said he
                            was going to discuss this subject at an agribusiness conference in
                            Chicago tonight.</p>
                        <p>Monsignor <persName corresp="#p_GMJ1">Gremillon</persName> said he hoped
                            that he and Monsignor Bordelon could work with the Vice President and
                            his staff, given his background and history of interest on this subject.
                            The Vice President said he wanted to work closely and he hoped they
                            would feel free to share with us their problems and any ideas they may
                            have. He said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJ3">Rielly</persName> of his

                            it became known that the President would not. When Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RJD1">Rockefeller</persName> asked the President to sign
                            early in December 1966, you believed it would be better for him to defer
                            until the leaders of one or more of the major developed nations would
                            also sign, so that the President would not be the only such signer.
                            Since then, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJD1">Rockefeller</persName> has
                            asked an additional 25 leaders to sign (list of countries at Tab C). The
                            leaders of Iran, Jordan, Barbados and Ghana have agreed (Tab C). Former
                            Prime Minister Zjilstra of the Netherlands agreed but is no longer in
                            office. I anticipate that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJD1"
                                >Rockefeller</persName> will ask Prime Minister de Jong to sign. He
                            has reasonable hopes from the reply to his letter to Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_WC1">Wilson</persName> that he will sign as
                            part of a governmental statement on population. Mr.

                            of importance. Apparently his requests to several other Heads of State

                        <p>I am pleased to send you an advance copy of the report on the World Food
                            Problem which was prepared by a Panel of the President's Science

                                The World Food Problem, consisted of three volumes; for a summary of

                            The report will be released by the White House on Sunday, June 18. This
                            report defines the magnitude of the food problem, describes the reasons
                            why the United States should be concerned, and outlines and recommends
                            what must be done if the problem is to be solved.</p>
                        <p>I believe the scope and significance of the report are apparent from its

                                    are so great that a massive, long-range, innovative effort

                                >Wilson</persName>'s agreement and asking for an early decision.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RJD1">Rockefeller</persName> would like to
                            have this before writing Prime Ministers Pearson, Holt and Holyoake to

                            again invite their signatures. However, he will write these three before
                            leaving August 11 for the Far East, even if he has not heard from Sato.
                            He will send copies to each of our Ambassadors which will initiate their
                            follow up with their Prime Ministers, as requested in our messages to

                            no further than Pope Paul's statements in the Encyclical Populorum

                                submitted the proposal to the Bureau of the Budget, which had
                                responded unfavorably. (Memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_CPP1"

                                consultation with <persName>Laurence Rockefeller</persName>,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CSDJ1">Cater</persName> decided that the
                                matter should be deferred until late September. (Ibid.) In October
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CSDJ1">Cater</persName> asked <persName
                                    corresp="#p_CPP1">Claxton</persName> to survey interested

                            interested people thought about it. Here is a summary of the information
                            I had collected.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> believes the
                            Commission should be undertaken at an appropriate time, primarily as a
                            matter of importance to the United States internally, but also because
                            the existence of such a study will put us in a less vulnerable position
                            as we endeavor to obtain appropriate attention by foreign countries to
                            their population growth problems. The list of members should be looked
                            at for proper balance.</p>
                        <p>Phil Lee told me that Secretary Gardner, who last year was doubtful about
                            the desirability of such a study, now believes it should be undertaken.
                            He thought it should have a domestic emphasis. The immediate need is for

                            Since a Commission would presumably recommend such increases, it would
                            be wrong to go forward unless the President believes he could propose
                            such increases to the Congress. Secretary Gardner would like to go over
                            the membership list with care before appointments might be made.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_USL1">Udall</persName> strongly favored
                            such a Commission. He suggested a blue-ribbon group to focus sharply on
                            the domestic population problem with the thought that recognition that
                            we have a problem and are taking action to move on it would help us
                            abroad. He would like to review the list of names suggested to be sure
                            highly qualified people from minority groups are included. He believed
                            strongly the Commission should be public in nature with a report to be
                            made publicly.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Weaver's office reported that he would go along with the
                            proposal.</p>
                        <p>Sargent Shriver was not convinced that the public visibility of a
                            Presidential Commission is needed at this time. He thinks good progress
                            is being made in obtaining public acceptance of the need for providing
                            opportunities for family planning through individual freedom of
                            choice—such as the Family Planning Program conducted by OEO. He was
                            concerned that the publicity attendant on White House projects might
                            upset present acquiescence and tacit support by groups in our society
                            that are evolving new positions in this sensitive area. However, if such
                            a Commission were established, OEO would cooperate fully with it. The
                            membership of such a Commission should be less professorial and should
                            include those who can speak for the poor, including Negro spokesmen for
                            that group.</p>

                        <p>On July 29, 1968, the Vatican released Pope Paul VI's encyclical letter,
                            Humanae Vitae, on birth control. It reaffirmed traditional Catholic
                            views, calling every form of contraception except voluntary continence
                            “illicit.” In doing so the Pope overruled the recommendations of the
                            majority of the Papal Commission set up by his predecessor to provide a
                            factual basis for a reply by the Church. The encyclical also viewed
                            economic development and social progress as the only solutions to the
                            problems of the developing world. A detailed discussion of the
                            encyclical and a comprehensive analysis of world reaction is in INR

                        <p>On May 1, 1961, National Airlines Flight 440 to Key West became the first
                            American aircraft to be hijacked to Cuba. Three more American planes
                            were seized during July and August. On September 5, 1961, P.L. 87–197
                            made it a crime to commit or attempt to commit air piracy. (U.S.
                            Congress, House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Subcommittee on
                            Inter-American Affairs, Air Piracy in the Caribbean Area; Report
                            Pursuant to H. Res. 179 (1968), page 4) After the law was passed, in the
                            period September 1961–July 1967, two hijacking attempts were frustrated,
                            two succeeded, and one plane was stolen and flown to Cuba. (Appendix A;
                            ibid.)</p>
                        <p>Previous international prohibitions on the seizure of aircraft during
                            transnational flights were stipulated in the Chicago Convention of 1944,
                            which codified public international aviation law. To strengthen these
                            measures, as early as 1950 the legal committee of the International
                            Civil Aviation Organization (<gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss>)
                            began a study of the jurisdictional issues of crimes committed on board
                            aircraft. The Tokyo Convention, completed by the committee in 1963,
                            established a positive rule of law that awarded jurisdiction over
                            offenses committed on board an aircraft to the State in which the
                            aircraft was registered. The convention was signed by 29 nations but
                            would not enter into force until 12 nations had ratified it. (Public
                            Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName

                            pages 974–975) As late as the end of 1968, only seven nations—Denmark,
                            Norway, Sweden, the Philippines, Portugal, the Republic of China, and
                            Italy—were signatories. (Air Piracy in the Caribbean Area)</p>
                        <p>In August and September 1967 two Colombian planes were hijacked, followed
                            by seizure of a Bahamian craft in November. In the United States, a
                            small plane was hijacked on February 17, 1968. Four days later, a DC–8
                            with 102 passengers was hijacked to Cuba on a Chicago-to-Miami run.
                            During March hijackers struck Colombian, Venezuelan, Mexican, and
                            American aircraft.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LFE1">Loy</persName> opened by saying that we
                            have been concerned by the number of recent incidents of US and other
                            aircraft hijacked to Cuba<note n="2" xml:id="d297fn2">See <ref
                                    target="#d296">Document 296</ref>. A complete listing of all
                                hijacked aircraft and details of the incidents are in Appendix A of
                                Air Piracy in the Caribbean Area, cited in <ref target="#d296"
                                    >Document 296</ref>.</note> and particularly the hijacking of
                            commercial aircraft, which threatens the safety of so many passengers.
                            He pointed out there are two major aspects to this problem from our
                            point of view: first, what can be done to discourage these incidents and
                            second, how best to assure the return of aircraft and passengers once a
                            hijacking occurs.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the latter question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LFE1"
                                >Loy</persName> stressed that we have not had any problems in the
                            past and, despite Castro's recent speech indicating he might not be so
                            cooperative in the future, we did not anticipate any difficulty.
                            However, in the event that there should be some difficulty about the
                            return of a plane and/or passengers which could not be resolved through
                            other channels, we might want at that time to ask the Director-General
                            if he could be of some assistance. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LFE1"
                                >Loy</persName> said again that we were not asking Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HK1">Hammarskjold</persName> to take any action at this
                            time and we would not want anyone, particularly the Cubans, to get the
                            impression we were anticipating difficulties. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HK1">Hammarskjold</persName> said he understood and,
                            without giving any definite commitment, indicated that his office might
                            well be able to be of some assistance in such a situation if the need
                            should arise. He observed that <gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss>
                            might also be able to help since the seizure of an aircraft engaged in
                            scheduled international service would be contrary to the Chicago
                            Convention. He mentioned also the Tokyo Convention on offenses committed
                            on board aircraft but it was noted that the Convention <pb n="522"
                                xml:id="pg_522" facs="0552"/>is not yet in force and that it has not
                            been ratified either by the US or Cuba.</p>
                        <p>As for possible means of discouraging hijacking, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LFE1">Loy</persName> summarized recent hijacking
                            incidents and pointed out that in many cases the individuals involved
                            had been mentally unbalanced and/or criminals fleeing from justice. He
                            said we had been considering the possible deterrent effects if such
                            individuals could be returned to the country where the hijacking was
                            committed to stand trial. We realized, he said, there are both legal and
                            political difficulties involved in extradition of such persons to or
                            from Cuba. Moreover, while the US Government might be willing to explore
                            the possibility of a reciprocal understanding on the return of
                            commercial aircraft hijackers, where the lives and property of others
                            are generally endangered, we have reason to believe that the Cubans
                            would probably want to extend the issue to cover the return of all
                            escapees from Cuba, including those that may escape by means of small
                            boats, rafts, etc. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LFE1">Loy</persName> said
                            return of such persons—who were often politically motivated—would
                            generally be politically and morally unacceptable to the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LFE1">Loy</persName> pointed out, again, that
                            we were not asking Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HK1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> to take any specific action at this time
                            but, rather, were interested in obtaining his views as to what might be
                            done in this regard. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HK1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> said he had given careful thought to this
                            matter. He could, he said, more readily visualize a role for <gloss
                                target="#t_IATA1">IATA</gloss>, as a representative of the carriers,
                            on the question of return of aircraft and passengers than on the more
                            political question of return of hijackers. He said any action by <gloss
                                target="#t_IATA1">IATA</gloss> in this regard would have to be very
                            carefully considered but he did not preclude the possibility. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HK1">Hammarskjold</persName> then said that his office
                            might be willing to consider a low-key approach, through Cubana Airlines
                            officials, indicating that the various carriers involved, i.e., Mexican,
                            Venezuelan, and Colombian, as well as US, had expressed to him their
                            concern over these incidents and asked his office to explore possible
                            ways of discouraging future incidents. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HK1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> implied he might be willing in this context
                            to raise the question of the deterrent effect of returning hijackers of
                            commercial aircraft.</p>
                        <p>As a representative of the commercial air carriers, the Director General
                            would be concerned only with hijackings involving commercial aircraft.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HK1">Hammarskjold</persName> pointed out that
                            there will be a number of meetings where such an approach might be made,
                            including an <gloss target="#t_IATA1">IATA</gloss> Traffic Conference
                            beginning September 18 in Cannes, an <gloss target="#t_IATA1"
                                >IATA</gloss> Annual General Meeting in Munich at the end of October
                            and an <gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss> meeting in Buenos Aires at
                            the end of September. He observed, however, that if any such approach
                            were to be made by his office, it should be discussed in advance by the
                            Governments of the countries most directly concerned.</p>
                        <pb n="523" xml:id="pg_523" facs="0553"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HK1">Hammarskjold</persName> asked whether we
                            had considered the possibility of encouraging prosecution of aircraft
                            hijackers by the government of the country to which the aircraft is
                            diverted. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LFE1">Loy</persName> replied that
                            this had been discussed and that, while the US Government probably would
                            not object in many cases, we would not want to be in the position of
                            urging the Cubans to prosecute US citizens. Moreover, there was a
                            question whether the hijacking of a foreign-owned aircraft in another
                            country would be a crime under Cuban law aside from the technical
                            question of unauthorized entry, and whether, for political reasons, the
                            Cubans would have any desire to prosecute such persons.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GJ1">Gazdik</persName> raised the question of
                            protective measures on aircraft such as requiring that the door to the
                            flight deck be kept locked, arming of the crew, etc. and said <gloss
                                target="#t_IATA1">IATA</gloss> felt strongly that in an attempted
                            hijacking situation particular care should be exercised to avoid
                            violence that might endanger the safety of the aircraft. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LFE1">Loy</persName> said we concurred, and pointed out
                            that when the life of a crew member or passenger is threatened, the
                            pilot has little moral alternative but to comply with the hijacker's
                            demands, assuming there is sufficient fuel, etc. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GJ1">Gazdik</persName> said there had been suggestions
                            that there should be a device on the aircraft to permit the flight crew
                            to observe the passenger compartment from the flight deck. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LFE1">Loy</persName> said he felt this ought to be
                            explored. In general, however, we were not sanguine about the general
                            usefulness of such measures for the reasons already indicated.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HK1">Hammarskjold</persName> said he would
                            continue to give some attention to these matters and would be in touch
                            if he had any further suggestions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LFE1"
                                >Loy</persName> thanked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HK1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> for his time and his thoughts on these
                            matters and added that we might want to get in touch with him again in
                            this regard.<note n="3" xml:id="d297fn3">In a May 1 letter to <persName

                            <item>Proposal has been made in Congressional and aviation circles that
                                U.S. announce that persons desiring to return to Cuba may use
                                refugee airlift plane particularly since aircraft now travels
                                without passengers on Miami-Varadero leg. Department believes this
                                does not really meet basic problem inasmuch as most hijackings have
                                been carried out not by Cuban refugees desiring return to Cuba but
                                rather by others including fugitives from justice on criminal
                                charges and persons of unstable mental condition. Obviously <gloss
                                    target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> cannot facilitate flight of
                                criminal fugitives and most persons of type who have hijacked planes
                                in past would not be likely apply to <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                    >USG</gloss> for travel on airlift plane or to Cuban Government
                                for admission. In any case, refugee airlift is operated pursuant to
                                Memorandum of Understanding between U.S. and Cuban governments and
                                any change in present exclusive use of airlift for refugees from
                                Cuba would require Cuban concurrence. Moreover, any persons
                                transported to Cuba would undoubtedly have to be approved for
                                admission by <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> on individual case
                                basis.</item>

                            <item>Nevertheless, to extent that any Cuban exiles living in U.S. might
                                wish to return to Cuba and might be tempted to hijack a plane, this
                                danger might be diminished somewhat if such persons knew they could
                                return to Cuba on airlift planes. Cuban refugees in U.S. have always
                                been free to return to Cuba permanently if they wish to do so,
                                provided of course they are not wanted in U.S. on criminal charges,
                                but transport has been practically limited to flights from Mexico or
                                Europe. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would be prepared to
                                announce that such persons could use refugee airlift for
                                repatriation if <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> concurred and
                                agreed to admission of persons involved.</item>

                            <item>Department therefore requests Swiss Embassy Havana to explore this
                                question with <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> and ascertain
                                whether Cuban Government will agree in principle. It is presumed

                                there for permanent residence. It would not include those wishing to
                                go to Cuba for temporary visit or anyone without previous permanent
                                residence in Cuba.</item>

                                    approached them again on July 23 and July 30. A Swiss official
                                    said that “he assumed absence of reply from Swiss Embassy Havana
                                    reflected likelihood that Cubans had not reacted to Swiss

                                six attempted hijackings had been successful since the April
                                meeting. Most recently, on July 17 a DC–8 from Los Angeles to Miami
                                was forced to refuel in New Orleans before continuing on to
                                Havana.</note> We believed that the situation had become so serious
                            that, in distinction to our last conversation, we were now asking <gloss
                                target="#t_IATA1">IATA</gloss> to take up with the Cuban Government,
                            through such channels as <gloss target="#t_IATA1">IATA</gloss> deems
                            appropriate, the problems of enlisting the cooperation of the Cuban
                            Government in deterring future hijacking. Specifically, we think there
                            would be a deterrent effect if Cuba could return hijackers to stand
                            trial in the US, or other country where the hijacking occurred. I
                            indicated that if the Cubans asked whether this would be a reciprocal
                            arrangement, we could make it such so long as it dealt with like
                            incidents, i.e. incidents involving large commercial carriers, or <gloss
                                target="#t_IATA1">IATA</gloss> carriers, or however the matter might

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Gadzik</persName> said he appreciated our concern and he
                            recognized that matters had gotten a little more serious since our April
                            meeting. He noted one immediate caveat, which is that it wasn't clear to
                            him whether Cuba would be willing to return Cuban citizens. I indicated
                            that I thought that hijacking was still a crime in the US regardless of
                            nationality, but I also noted that most of the hijackers had been US
                            citizens. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GJ1">Gazdik</persName> said he could
                            not act without consultations with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HK1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName>, but he would try to get hold of Mr.

                        <p>205994. 1. In last year there have been 14 incidents of hijackings of
                            planes to Cuba. Although few cases involved small chartered aircraft <pb
                                n="527" xml:id="pg_527" facs="0557"/>most were commercial airliners.
                            Nine of planes were of U.S. registry and remainder of Colombian,
                            Venezuelan and Mexican registry. In all cases so far planes and
                            passengers have been allowed to depart Cuba but all hijackers have been
                            given asylum there and in one case pilot of U.S. plane, now U.S.
                            citizen, was detained on charges relating to his earlier departure from
                            Cuba.</p>
                        <p>2. Increasing frequency of these hijackings has caused great concern in
                            aviation and governmental circles as well as in general public.
                            Examination of security measures designed to reduce hijacking hazard
                            indicates difficulties of preventing inclusion of hijackers in flights
                            and once hijacker is aboard little can be done to thwart him in view of
                            high risk to safety of plane and passengers. Emphasis therefore being
                            placed on deterrence which might result from knowledge hijackers could
                            not count on safe asylum in other country.</p>
                        <p>3. While <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> has so far permitted all
                            hijackers remain in Cuba, there is no evidence thus far that <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> is back of hijackings and there are
                            some indications it may be uncomfortable over publicity these incidents
                            and fact hijackers remain in Cuba. While few of hijackers appear to be
                            Cubans, majority have not been and many are either mentally unbalanced
                            or criminal fugitives. However, prospect for surrender of hijackers for
                            prosecution in U.S. does not appear favorable if solution attempted in
                            purely U.S.-Cuban bilateral terms.</p>
                        <p>4. Department therefore exploring with international civil aviation
                            organizations possibility of attempting solution on basis of fact

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LFE1">Loy</persName> began by thanking the
                            Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_HK1">Hammarskjold</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_GJ1">Gazdik</persName> on behalf of the United States
                            Government for undertaking to help us deal with the Cubans on the
                            hijacking problem. He stated that he had some statistics on the
                            hijacking of planes to Cuba, as well as some biographical and
                            motivational information on the hijackers, which he would first
                            summarize and then hand over to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HK1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> for the latter's use. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HK1">Hammarskjold</persName> asked if there was “any
                            pattern.” Mr. <persName>Fitzgerald</persName> stated that the element
                            most common to all of hijackers was mental instability, although some
                            common criminals were involved. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LFE1"
                                >Loy</persName> said that it was hard to find a pattern; however,
                            political objectives were apparently not dominant, except that, in
                            relation to the hijackings of foreign aircraft to Cuba, there was some
                            evidence of political motivation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HK1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> asked if any Cuban planes had been
                            hijacked. Mr. <persName>Fitzgerald</persName> replied that there had
                            been no such instances in recent years, although there had been
                            instances of small planes having been stolen in Cuba and flown to the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LFE1">Loy</persName> then said that we had
                            thought of several things that might be done in relation to hijacking,
                            first in specific regard to Cuba and second in regard to hijacking in
                            general; and that the objective was to find a way to deter hijackers. He
                            hoped that it would be possible to persuade the Cubans that their return
                            to the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> of hijackers, both past and
                            future, would pose a deterrence and would be in the Cuban as well as the
                            United States interest. He then described a recent <hi rend="italic">New
                                York Times</hi> story, referring to a story in the Miami News, which
                            indicated that the Cubans took a dim view of hijacking and hijackers,
                            adding that, while he had no way of knowing whether the story was
                            accurate, he had no reason to doubt it. It showed an intelligent point
                            of view by the Cubans. He went on to say that it was apparent that the
                            hijacking of the El Al plane to Algeria had caused severe strains and
                            divisions within the Algerian government; and that this might be pointed
                            out to the Cubans by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HK1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HK1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> observed that a recent <gloss
                                target="#t_IATA1">IATA</gloss> statement about hijacking was a
                            non-political one. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LFE1">Loy</persName> went
                            on to say that we had had no problem with the Cubans so far with regard
                            to the return of the planes and the passengers, but that, for the sake
                            of deterrence, we would wish the hijackers to be returned. We would be
                            prepared to consider a reciprocal agreement with the Cubans for the
                            return of hijacked planes, hijacked passengers who wished to return to
                            Cuba and of hijackers. But we would balk at a deal involving the return
                            of political refugees.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HK1">Hammarskjold</persName> observed that “we
                            have the instruments we need,” both for the definition of issues and
                            deterrence, in the Tokyo Convention.<note n="2" xml:id="d301fn2">See
                                    <ref target="#d296">Document 296</ref>.</note> He said that he
                            recently had received assurances from <pb n="530" xml:id="pg_530"
                                facs="0560"/>the Venezuelan and Colombian governments, and was
                            expecting one from the Mexican government, that each would enforce
                            Article 11 of the Convention as if the Convention were in effect if
                            others would.<note n="3" xml:id="d301fn3">None of these governments had
                                yet ratified the convention.</note> However, he conceded that there
                            was some doubt as to what the Convention did to the hijacker himself.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LFE1">Loy</persName> said he had not thought
                            of the Tokyo Convention as requiring the return of the hijacker as
                            opposed to allowing the onward movement of the plane and those
                            passengers who wanted to go. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GJ1"
                                >Gazdik</persName> said this was a matter of interpretation; that so
                            much of Article 11 as required signatory countries to “take all
                            appropriate means to restore control of the aircraft to its lawful
                            commander” could be interpreted so as to require the return of the
                            hijacker. (There then ensued a general discussion of this point and
                            several doubts were expressed as to the validity of Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GJ1">Gazdik</persName>'s proffered interpretation, which
                            he himself described as strained.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GJ1">Gazdik</persName> asked if we had any
                            information as to what had happened to the hijackers now in Cuba. Mr.
                                <persName>Fitzgerald</persName> said that we had very spotty
                            information, that one was known to be working on the Isle of Pines,
                            presumably in the cane fields, that one had been executed for crimes
                            subsequently committed in Cuba, that a couple more (including the
                            hijacker of the NAL DC–8 in July) were known to be in jail; but that was
                            about all we had since the Cubans gave very little public play to these
                            incidents.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GJ1">Gazdik</persName> then asked if we knew of
                            any provisions of Cuban law relative to hijacking. Mr.
                                <persName>Mendelsohn</persName> said that we did not know of any.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HK1">Hammarskjold</persName> then returned to
                            the Miami News story and, after a general rehashing of its contents,
                            asked if we were doing anything to give it more publicity. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LFE1">Loy</persName> replied that we had considered this
                            and were casting about to find out what could be done. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GJ1">Gazdik</persName> then observed that our real
                            interest seemed to be in getting the hijacker back, and asked if we did
                            not have an extradition treaty with Cuba. Mr. <persName>Frank</persName>
                            stated that it was doubtful that the treaty would apply, citing among
                            other considerations the one that it had been concluded with a
                            predecessor government to the Castro government. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LFE1">Loy</persName> said that the important thing was
                            that the Cubans return the hijackers, with or without a treaty or an
                            agreement; and that, however they wanted to do it, if they wanted to,
                            that was enough for us.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HK1">Hammarskjold</persName> said that it might
                            be useful if the Cubans were under the pressure that the matter might
                            come up at the <gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss> conference in
                            Buenos Aires this September; they presumably would want their hands
                            clean at that time. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LFE1">Loy</persName>
                            stated that we were thinking about ways and means which this issue would
                            be raised at Buenos <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531" facs="0561"/>Aires. He
                            also said that we had considered approaching Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWA2">Binaghi</persName>
                            <note n="4" xml:id="d301fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_LFE1">Loy</persName> had met with Walter
                                Binaghi on May 17; see <ref target="#d297fn3">footnote 3, Document

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LFE1">Loy</persName> then said that one of the
                            U.S. carriers had suggested the payment of a cash award to the Cubans
                            for the return of a hijacker.<note n="5" xml:id="d301fn5">See <ref
                                    target="#d300fn3">footnote 3, Document 300</ref>.</note> He said
                            that we were not sure whether this idea could be married to our other
                            proposals, i.e. whether it was compatible with approaches based on
                            concern with safety; but that if other measures did not work, perhaps we
                            would turn to this one. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HK1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> observed that the Cubans give excellent ATC
                            service to aircraft flying near Cuba for only nominal fees; and that
                            perhaps a general increase in the fees would be preferable to the reward
                            approach. Mr. <persName>Fitzgerald</persName> said that the reward would
                            be offered generally, not just to the Cubans. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HK1">Hammarskjold</persName> thought that the
                            increase-in-fees idea would be “cleaner.” Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LFE1">Loy</persName> thought the approach to the Cubans
                            on safety and international responsibility would be better without the
                            reward aspect. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HK1">Hammarskjold</persName>
                            said that the Cuban(s) whom they were going to talk to that afternoon
                            either had been told to accept some type of proposal, or to do nothing
                            but listen; but that he agreed the public interest approach, rather than
                            the reward one, was the better one.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LFE1">Loy</persName> then said that we had
                            discussed with the Mexican government the possibility of their taking up
                            the matter with the Cubans on the basis of Mexico having diplomatic
                            relations with Cuba and on the basis of a Mexican plane having been
                            involved in one of the hijackings. While the Mexicans had expressed an
                            interest, no action had been taken yet; but Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HK1">Hammarskjold</persName> should be aware of this.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HK1">Hammarskjold</persName> thought this was
                            “a clever idea.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LFE1">Loy</persName> then said that, turning to
                            the subject of hijacking world-wide, the <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> was also concerned about this larger problem. He said
                            that we hoped to be able to submit the Tokyo Convention to the Senate in
                            the near future. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HK1">Hammarskjold</persName>
                            said he had commitments from the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>,
                            Germany, Holland and France that each planned to accede before the end
                            of 1968.<note n="6" xml:id="d301fn6">None of these countries acceded in
                                1968.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LFE1">Loy</persName> said
                            that probably the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would accede; but
                            that it was sort of a poor time of year to be sending things to the
                                Congress.<note n="7" xml:id="d301fn7">The convention was submitted

                            then said that we had some ideas about what <gloss target="#t_IATA1"
                                >IATA</gloss> might consider doing on a general basis. (Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LFE1">Loy</persName> then presented and
                            described the proposals set out on p. 3 of the attached talking <pb

                                target="#t_IATA1">IATA</gloss> offering a cash award for the return
                            of a hijacker. He stressed these were ideas for consideration rather
                            than <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> proposals.) Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HK1">Hammarskjold</persName> said that all of these were
                            worth discussion. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GJ1">Gazdik</persName> said
                            that the <gloss target="#t_CAB1">CAB</gloss> might have some difficulty
                            with the proposal that <gloss target="#t_IATA1">IATA</gloss> carriers
                            refuse the provision of interline and other usual services to the
                            carrier(s) of a state refusing the reasonably prompt return of a
                            hijacked plane and its passengers. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LFE1"
                                >Loy</persName> said that we could present him with a <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> view, including that of the <gloss
                                target="#t_CAB1">CAB</gloss>, if he wished. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GJ1">Gazdik</persName> said that, with regard to the
                            proposal that <gloss target="#t_IATA1">IATA</gloss> carriers pressure
                            their governments to refuse landing and take-off rights to the
                            carrier(s) of a hijack-offending state, <gloss target="#t_IATA1"
                                >IATA</gloss> preferred not to get into the business of recommending
                            to carriers what to do or not do in relation to their governments; that
                            perhaps <gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss> would be a better
                            mechanism for the implementation of this proposal.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GJ1">Gazdik</persName> then went on to outline
                            an idea of his to the effect that perhaps the Two Freedoms provision of
                            the Transit Agreement could be used to pressure a hijack-offending
                            state. In substance, it was that the privilege to land for non-traffic
                            purposes included the privilege to take off after such landing; that a
                            state refusing the take-off privilege was in violation of the Agreement;
                            that the state of the aircraft involved could complain of this violation
                            to <gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss>; that <gloss target="#t_ICAO1"
                                >ICAO</gloss> then had to send a commission to investigate the
                            complaint; and that the dispatch of this commission would be highly
                            embarrassing to the state visited, etc. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LFE1"
                                >Loy</persName> said he would think about this and would consider an
                            approach to <gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss>. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HK1">Hammarskjold</persName> said that he was
                            disappointed that the whole problem of hijacking had not been handed
                            over to one of its specialized agencies (<gloss target="#t_ICAO1"
                                >ICAO</gloss>) by the UN for handling.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LFE1">Loy</persName> then asked if there was
                            anything else Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HK1">Hammarskjold</persName> and
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GJ1">Gazdik</persName> wished to talk about.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GJ1">Gazdik</persName> asked if we had used
                            our extradition treaty with Cuba recently. Mr.
                                <persName>Frank</persName> said that we had not; that perhaps we
                            would not object to making a request under it; but that its use raised
                            other issues. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GJ1">Gazdik</persName> asked if
                            we had concluded any type of an agreement with the Cubans during the
                            past two or three years. Mr. <persName>Fitzgerald</persName> said that
                            we had concluded the Refugee Airlift Agreement, although the Swiss had
                            acted for us, and that, of course, we were in several multilateral
                            agreements with the Cubans. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HK1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> asked if we had any impression of their
                            general attitude on the subject of hijacking, whether they seemed to
                            think that they were under some obligation to “behave normally.” Mr.
                                <persName>Fitzgerald</persName> stated again that, to date at least,
                            the Cubans had returned hijacked planes and passengers fairly promptly;
                            but that there was no evident <pb n="533" xml:id="pg_533" facs="0563"
                            />basic change in their overall attitude toward the U.S. which was
                            militantly anti-U.S. He observed that the Cubans had good reason for
                            relaxing the tensions between the two countries because of their severe
                            economic problems, but they had given no evidence of such relaxation. He
                            added that he thought Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HK1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> should be aware that we went to great
                            lengths to return assorted small watercraft to Cuba which had been used
                            for transporting political refugees.</p>
                        <p>There being nothing further, the meeting broke up at about 1:00 p.m.</p>

                        <p>On August 1, L sent to you for transmittal to the President documents
                            necessary to obtain the advice and consent of the Senate to the Tokyo
                            Convention. In my memorandum of August 21<note n="2" xml:id="d303fn2"
                                >Not found.</note> I advised you that the Senate Foreign Relations
                            Committee staff suggested we should send the Convention to the Senate,
                            stating that the Committee was probably as anxious as we were to do
                            something about hijacking.</p>
                        <p>An additional factor favoring early action on this matter is that the
                            Triennial Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization
                                (<gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss>) is meeting in Buenos Aires
                            commencing September 3. We hope to use the <gloss target="#t_ICAO1"
                                >ICAO</gloss> Assembly forum to encourage other governments to
                            expedite their ratification of the Convention. However, our efforts to
                            do this would be seriously handicapped unless we ourselves could
                            indicate that the Convention had at least been transmitted to our Senate
                            although not yet ratified.</p>
                        <p>In view of the favorable attitude of Senator Sparkman, the Acting

                            next 3 weeks. During that time an attempt to hijack a Canadian plane was
                            thwarted, but one American and two Colombian aircraft were forced to fly
                            to Cuba. <gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss> Director General

                                >ICAO</gloss> plenary session. (Telegram 4815 from Buenos Aires,

                            become parties to the Tokyo Convention “as soon as possible” and
                            encouraged them, even before ratification of or adherence to it, “to
                            give effect to the principles of Article II of that Convention.” It also

                            institute a study of other measures which could be taken to cope with
                            the growing problem. The vote in both the legal committee and the
                            plenary session in favor of the resolution was unanimous. (Letter from
                            Macomber to Fascell, October 3; ibid., AV 12 US)</p>
                        <p>The Cuban delegate raised no objection to the resolution, but was
                            critical of the United States: “Cuba agrees with the concern over
                            hijacking… . At no time has Cuba encouraged such seizures. We consider
                            that the mere fact of Convention ratification would not prevent
                            hijacking. The difficulty and roots of the problem is tyranny in the
                            United States—the massacre of Negro people and the Vietnam war. Let that
                            cease and then hijacking will cease.” (Ibid.)</p>
                        <p>The delegates also discussed additional measures to prevent seizures and
                            encourage the return of hijackers, but “at least two delegations (Spain
                            and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>) indicated some skepticism that
                            their governments would agree to do anything against the concept of

                            no initiative was taken internationally to prevent it. Such facts are
                            derived from the criminal policy of blockade and hostility which the
                            imperialist Government of the United States of America has adopted
                            against Cuba with the support of the oligarchical and reactionary
                            governments of Latin America. We believe that as long as such criminal
                            policy is maintained no investigation (examination) whatsoever can take
                            place to avoid its regrettable consequences. Therefore we regret not to
                            be able to accept your suggestion. The Revolutionary Government of Cuba
                            has never encouraged nor does it encourage high jacking of aircraft. But
                            such facts have become a practice adopted against our country by the
                            promoters of a stupid policy lacking of foresight the regrettable
                            consequences of which are apparent.' I take this opportunity to send you
                            my highest regards. Dr. Ricardo Alarcon, Ambassador, Permanent
                            Representative, Permanent Mission of Cuba at the United Nations”</p>

                                interest/involvement, Embassy should approach FonSec with request to

                            have the Cubans return to us one or more hijackers for trial, without
                            any public statement.</p>
                        <p>We are not totally confident that these actions will produce the desired
                            result, or any particularly desirable reaction from the Cubans. But we
                            feel strongly that <gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss> should increase
                            its efforts to deal with the hijacking problem. The most obvious effort
                            is to obtain the cooperation of the Cubans who, however innocently, are
                            intimately enmeshed in the hijacking picture.</p>
                        <p>The November 4 hijacking of the NAL B–727 to Havana is the 32d instance
                            of a hijacking or attempted hijacking to Cuba since May 1961, and the
                            15th such instance in the past 6 months. It was also the first instance
                            of actual physical violence in the cockpit. Hijackings are on the
                            increase. The threat to the safety of air travel is obvious. It is
                            equally obvious that a meaningful deterrent to hijacking is needed now;
                            and that we cannot wait for international law to be brought to that
                            point at which it poses a meaningful deterrent to hijacking. We believe
                            the best deterrent would be the return of hijackers for trial or their
                            trial in the country to which they have taken the aircraft. A statement
                            by the <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> along the line set out above
                            is the best and most immediate deterrent which occurs to us.</p>
                        <p>It can be pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> does
                            not approve of hijacking. The Cuban representative to the 16th Assembly
                            voted for the anti-hijacking resolution. And, to date, the Cubans have
                            acted responsibly in returning planes and passengers.</p>

                            this (see Memorandum of Conversation, <persName corresp="#p_LFE1"

                            the ground that “political” considerations are involved. To this it can
                            be said that the planes and passengers of several nations have been
                            involved; that our request for his assistance is not politically
                            motivated, but is based solely on considerations of air safety; that
                            only the Cubans attach political connotation to hijacking to Cuba; and
                            that, in any event, the threat to air safety certainly overrides any
                            political considerations which possibly could be involved.</p>
                        <p>We anticipate also that <persName corresp="#p_BWA2">Binaghi</persName>
                            may demur on the grounds that he would not wish to “single out” Cuba.
                            The answer to this is that, as a practical matter, Cuba must be singled
                            out because more hijacked planes go to Cuba than to anywhere else.</p>

                        <p>Until now efforts to obtain Cuban cooperation in deterring the hijacking
                            of aircraft have been confined to third-party initiatives because it was
                            considered that these represented the best hope of success. However,
                            with the failure of these initiatives thus far, and the alarming
                            increase in frequency of hijackings, we now request authorization to
                            approach the Cubans bilaterally through the Swiss, proposing an
                            arrangement for return of hijackers. If we do so we must be prepared to
                            offer reciprocity by returning to Cuba hijackers of Cuban commercial
                            planes even though they ask for political asylum.</p>

                        <p>Attached is a note which proposes that the Cuban Government return
                            hijackers of commercial aircraft,<note n="2" xml:id="d309fn2">Not
                                printed.</note> and offers to discuss arrangements for the return of
                            hijackers on a reciprocal basis if so desired by the Cuban Government.
                            If you agree, we shall transmit this note to the <gloss target="#t_GOC1"
                                >GOC</gloss> through the Swiss as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>Until now, we have confined our efforts to obtain Cuban cooperation in
                            the return of hijackers to third-party initiatives such as that
                            undertaken by Knute Hammarskjold, Director General of the International
                            Air Transport Association (<gloss target="#t_IATA1">IATA</gloss>).
                            Prospects of a favorable Cuban response are dim, and it had been our
                            belief that a direct approach by the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            would be even less likely to succeed. Therefore we planned to exhaust
                            other channels such as the Mexican Government and <gloss
                                target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss> before approaching Castro directly.
                            At this point, however, <persName corresp="#p_HK1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName>'s efforts have been rebuffed and hijackings
                            are increasing at an alarming rate. Public and Congressional pressure
                            for action is intense and we believe we should act promptly to test the
                            remote possibility that Castro would respond to a direct approach. It is
                            often asked whether we have approached Castro directly, and we wish to
                            be in a position to respond affirmatively in the near future. Therefore,
                            we propose to supplement our efforts to obtain Cuba's cooperation
                            through third parties, or in a multilateral context, with a direct
                            approach.</p>
                        <p>Until we get a response from the Cubans, we cannot predict what kind of
                            solution may be negotiated. What we would like to see, however, is a
                            Cuban undertaking to return hijackers. Our draft note specifically
                            contemplates reciprocity, as did <persName corresp="#p_HK1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName>'s proposals to Cuba, because we cannot
                            conceive of Castro's accepting less. The draft Protocol to the Tokyo
                            Convention concerning the return of hijackers which, with your approval,
                            we raised informally at the <gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss>
                            Assembly last August was premised on the assumption that the United
                            States would be prepared to reciprocate the return of hijackers even
                            when the hijacker claimed that he had committed the hijacking to escape
                            political persecution. As explained in the previous memorandum,<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d309fn3">Not further identified.</note> it has been
                            U.S. practice to decline extradition of political refugees for stealing
                            the means of escape. However, we have concluded that this practice
                            should not be applied to hijackers of airliners because of the
                            disproportionate hazard. We continue to believe that the serious dangers
                            to air safety caused by the hijacking of commercial aircraft outweigh
                            the hijacker's interest in securing political asylum, <pb n="543"
                                xml:id="pg_543" facs="0573"/>and our discussions on the Hill have
                            not revealed opposition to this judgment.</p>
                        <p>It is our hope to limit any understanding to commercial aircraft, thus
                            reducing the possibility of a problem arising with respect to a refugee
                            fleeing Cuba, but Castro might seek a broader agreement. We do not plan
                            to cover boats or military aircraft or to include theft of commercial
                            aircraft not involving coercion of the pilot.</p>
                        <p>If the Cuban Government should respond favorably to this proposal, it is
                            conceivable that it might lead to a Cuban request for face-to-face
                            negotiations between U.S. and Cuban representatives rather than through
                            the intermediary of the Swiss or other third-country representatives. We
                            believe we must be prepared to accept this if necessary in the interest
                            of solving so important a problem.</p>
                        <p>As extradition raises serious legal and political problems, we would
                            expect to implement our side of the agreement, in most cases, by
                            refusing to admit a non-U.S. citizen hijacker of a Cuban aircraft into
                            the United States and deporting the alien so excluded to Cuba. If
                            necessary to satisfy our laws, we would attempt to do so via the country
                            whence he came to the U.S. This procedure would represent a departure
                            from our normal immigration policy toward Cuba and INS has advised us
                            that they would be reluctant to take such action without the consent of
                            the Attorney General.<note n="4" xml:id="d309fn4">The following week,

                                wrote that the Attorney General suggested that strong efforts be
                                made to limit the agreement to commercial aircraft since problems
                                existed with regard to expulsion or deportation of possible

                        </list>
                        <p>Four US commercial airliners have been hijacked to Cuba during the past
                            two weeks, highlighting the continuing difficulty of finding a solution
                            to a complex legal, political and security problem. The hijackings
                            constitute not only a serious inconvenience to the airlines and
                            passengers, and a danger to life, but they also pose a security threat
                            to traveling US officials and to classified government documents carried
                            by air. Although there is no evidence of official Cuban complicity in
                            the hijackings, Fidel Castro does obtain a certain amount of political
                            leverage from the incidents. Efforts by the US Government to obtain the
                            cooperation of the Cuban government in stopping the hijackings have been
                            either rebuffed or ignored and the problem is gaining increasing public
                            and official concern.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Increased tempo</hi>. There have been twenty-seven
                            successful and unsuccessful attempts to hijack US and Latin American
                            planes to Cuba during 1968, compared to twelve during the period from
                            1961 through December 1967. Well over one-third of the hijackers were US
                            citizens, with the rest being Cuban exiles, or other Latin Americans.
                            There does not appear to be a distinct pattern to the hijackings; most
                            of the perpetrators can be classified as mentally ill, criminal types,
                            or simply homesick Cubans. It is believed that almost all of the
                            US-originated hijackers have been immediately jailed and thoroughly
                            interrogated on arrival in Cuba. None has been accorded a hero's welcome
                            and in most cases little has been heard from the persons after their
                            release from jail. There is as yet no evidence that any of the US or
                            Cuban hijackers have been encouraged in their ventures by the Cuban
                            government. Similarly, there is no hard information of the existence of
                            any sort of international conspiracy. Puerto Rican—liberationists—and
                            black militants have carried out a few of the hijackings, but again
                            there are no firm indications that these persons collaborated with the
                            Cubans. Some Colombian and Venezuelan hijackers have been well received
                            by the Cubans, but this is partly understandable in that it is extremely
                            difficult for members of Cuban-supported insurgency groups in the
                            hemisphere to reach Cuba using regularly scheduled flights. All of the
                            passengers of the US and Latin American hijacked planes have been
                            relatively well-treated, although the Cubans have harassed some US
                            servicemen in uniform, especially Negro veterans of Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Castro benefits</hi>. While the Cubans have shown some
                            nervousness, the hijacking episodes nevertheless provide Castro with a
                            domestic propaganda weapon. He attempts to show that these increasing
                            occurrences represent the desperation of Cuban exiles and US citizens to
                            leave the land of “workers exploitation” and journey to the “free
                            territory of the Americas.” In this way he seeks to discourage those who
                            are planning to eventually emigrate to the US. Moreover, Castro has very
                            little political and no economic leverage which he can apply against the
                            US, whom he considers Cuba's mortal enemy. A hijacked US airliner
                            naturally supplies him with the potential for blackmail or at least a
                            means of illustrating to US policymakers that the US also has an exposed
                            area. After each hijacking the US is forced to go to the Cuban
                            government, through the Swiss, and request the return of the plane, its
                            crew and passengers. The Cubans have always complied with the requests,
                            but since mid-year, they have used the episodes to engage in some
                            low-level harassment. Using the argument that the runways are too short,
                            they have not allowed the passengers to return to the US on the hijacked
                            airliner. Instead they have forced the planes to leave Cuba empty and
                            have obligated the State Department to arrange <pb n="546"
                                xml:id="pg_546" facs="0576"/>for the sending of a separate plane to
                            Cuba to retrieve the passengers—an annoying and time-consuming
                            operation. The Cubans are well aware that there is no danger to a fully
                            loaded jet taking off from the Havana airfield. In addition to the
                            separate plane harassment tactics, the Cubans have also charged the
                            airlines stiff fees for accommodating passengers.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">The refusal to return hijackers</hi>. The most
                            effective, and possibly the only feasible method of stopping the
                            hijacking, would be an agreement by Cuba to return the guilty persons.
                            Nevertheless, efforts by international conferences to work out a
                            mutually satisfactory agreement have not met with success and approaches
                            to the Cubans through the UN have been rebuffed. Moreover, the Cubans
                            have not officially responded to a US suggestion that dissatisfied
                            Cubans in the United States be allowed to return to Cuba on the
                            US-operated refugee airlift.</p>
                        <p>An extradition agreement between the US and Cuba remains in force, but
                            hijacking is not specified as an extraditable offense under the treaty.
                            Furthermore, Castro would probably find it very difficult for
                            ideological and public relations reasons to return Cubans to the United
                            States for prosecution, particularly if they come to him as
                            disillusioned persons who profess to believe that revolutionary Cuba is
                            the more desirable state. Even if Castro did find it advantageous to
                            return the non-Cubans, he would probably attempt to extract a fairly
                            high price from the US. He might, as an example, demand that the US
                            Government not give asylum to Cubans fleeing the island clandestinely
                            (or as hijackers) as a quid pro quo for an agreement to send back
                            non-Cubans to the US. It would however be politically difficult for the
                            US to agree to an arrangement of this kind.</p>
                        <p>A double-edge sword. Though Castro may take some satisfaction in the
                            hijackings, they probably also give him some sense of uneasiness. An
                            airline tragedy would expose Cuba to charges that its failure to
                            cooperate with the US to prevent hijackings had contributed to the
                            accident and, especially in view of the unbalanced personalities of many
                            hijackers, an accident is a very real possibility. In addition, Castro
                            may be concerned that the continued hijackings will increase pressure on
                            US officials to “do something about Cuba,” particularly with a new
                            administration about to assume office. The hijacking of four aircraft
                            from Mexico to Cuba is also believed to have caused some embarrassment
                            to the Cubans who are anxious to avoid additional strains in their
                            highly valued relations with Mexico. Legislation to combat hijackings
                            submitted to the Mexican legislature on December 5 by President Diaz
                            Ordaz (submission by the president is tantamount to passage) will
                            undoubtedly heighten Castro's <pb n="547" xml:id="pg_547" facs="0577"
                            />sensitivity to the seriousness of the matter, particularly where
                            Mexico is involved.<note n="2" xml:id="d310fn2">The proposed legislation

                        <p>On balance, however, at least for the short term, Castro will probably
                            continue to view the hijacking as primarily a US, and to a lesser
                            extent, a Mexican problem, and is not likely to feel any sense of
                            urgency about contributing to a settlement of the issue.</p>

                                to air safety. Armed, often dangerous and unbalanced, men are in
                                forcible control of an aircraft which they are unqualified to
                                operate. The discharge aloft of a firearm or explosive device could
                                precipitate the crash of an aircraft. Crewmen may be unfamiliar with
                                procedures for approaching their enforced destination, with the
                                extent and condition of the facilities at that destination, with the
                                language spoken there, and with the weather there and en route. For
                                much of their journeys, the aircraft are beyond the discipline of
                                ground control, threatening the safety not only of the particular
                                aircraft involved, but also of all other aircraft operating in the
                                area. Fortunately, there have been no major accidents involving
                                multiple deaths or injuries to date, but the danger of such
                                incidents has increased with the increase in the number of
                                hijackings and attempted hijackings in recent months.</item>

                                serious threat to air safety, and it has reason to hope that the

                                to air safety, and would be prepared, on humanitarian grounds, to
                                consider means of averting the threat of serious accidents before
                                one takes place. In particular, this Government notes that the Cuban

                                    >ICAO</gloss> at Buenos Aires stated that Cuba shared the
                                general concern over hijacking and that at no time had Cuba
                                encouraged such seizures. Further, the Government of the United

                                to the states of registration of the aircraft. Unfortunately, the
                                incidence of aircraft hijackings continues to increase and further
                                measures are necessary if such hijackings are to be deterred.</item>

                                    “non-committal” on the substance of the note and reacted
                                    unfavorably to press reports which had appeared in the United
                                    States prior to the presentation of the note. The Embassy in
                                    Bern reported: “Although the Cubans made no reference to quid
                                    pro quo, Ambassador Fischli considers it possible that Cuba
                                    might request, as compensation for return of hijackers, return
                                    of Cubans who left Cuba illegally by boat or private plane. He
                                    comments that, although situation entirely different because no
                                    international agreements exist regarding latter actions,
                                    argument might have certain political and propaganda

                        <p rend="flushleft">Dear Don:</p>
                        <p>I have your letter of December 4<note n="2" xml:id="d312fn2">Not
                                found.</note> concerning our proposed direct approach to the Cubans
                            on the subject of hijacking. You suggest that if we substituted a
                            concerted approach from Canada, Mexico and the U.S., we might have a
                            greater chance of enlisting Cuban cooperation.</p>
                        <p>You are obviously correct in your implicit belief that a direct
                            suggestion by the U.S. may not be successful. We agree there is merit in
                            stressing the multilateral view of the problem. For this reason our
                            efforts to date have involved action by <gloss target="#t_IATA1"
                                >IATA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss>.
                            Unfortunately, the <gloss target="#t_IATA1">IATA</gloss> efforts, which
                            have been direct and skillful, have been rebuffed to date by the
                                Cubans.<gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss> seems to be having
                            difficulty moving very rapidly.</p>
                        <p>We have also considered concerted action with other Western Hemisphere
                            countries, but have felt that, on balance, it was preferable for these
                            countries to go to the Cubans separately. There are several reasons.
                            First, if Castro has difficulty with a U.S. approach, this difficulty
                            would infect the whole of any joint approach, and thus make it more
                            difficult for him to agree with the Canadians, Mexicans or others to the
                            principle of returning hijackers for trial. Second, we earlier discussed
                            with the Mexicans their taking up this problem with Cuba, but subsequent
                            events, in their judgment, made the time inopportune. While the Mexicans
                            have their own hijacking problem, we doubt that they would be in a
                            position to move promptly on a joint approach. Third, there remains the
                            outside possibility that Cuba may in fact prefer to deal with the U.S.,
                            particularly in a situation where the U.S. has taken the first step.</p>
                        <p>I might add that <persName corresp="#p_HK1">Knut Hammarskjold</persName>
                            is continuing his multilateral efforts, and plans to sound out the
                            Cubans about the possibility of an <gloss target="#t_IATA1">IATA</gloss>
                            legal committee meeting in Havana to consider this problem.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d312fn3">On the same day Loy also wrote a comprehensive

                                should (1) return hijackers to the state(s) of registration(s) of

                                    <item>Hijacking poses a grave threat to the safety of air
                                        transportation. Armed, often mentally unbalanced persons are
                                        in forcible control of an aircraft which they are incapable
                                        of operating. Not being subject to ground control, the
                                        hijacked aircraft is a collision threat to other airborne
                                        aircraft. Crewmen are unfamiliar with approach procedures to

                                        hijacked aircraft is a serious threat to lives and property
                                        both in the air and on the ground.</item>

                                        Canadian flag commercial aircraft, have been hijacked to

                                Abram</persName>'s good work on a preliminary draft in the
                            Subcommission on Discrimination and Minorities last January, and support
                            gathered by our Delegation for a further adjustment in the Commission,
                            we were able to vote for the draft provision as adopted on this point.
                            Key wording—States agree to prohibit organizations, <pb n="556"
                                xml:id="pg_556" facs="0586"/>or the activities of organizations, as
                            appropriate, which promote and incite racial discrimination. Article 1
                            defines “racial discrimination” as discrimination “in public life.”</p>

                        <p>Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_TMF1">Tree</persName> took the initiative in
                            proposing an additional article in the race convention condemning
                            anti-Semitism. This was possible because the convention covers
                            discrimination on ethnic as well as racial grounds. The <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> tried to add a reference to “nazism,
                            genocide and neo-nazism” to this, but stated publicly that it would
                            support an article on anti-Semitism. Reactions from Jewish organizations
                            and others have been highly favorable. The Commission did not have time
                            to complete action on this article, and has passed it on with the <gloss

                            Commission. Thus far we have not had to state an over-all position
                            because the draft is not complete. We hope <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"
                                >ECOSOC</gloss> may have time to complete the substantive section
                            (only anti-Semitism is outstanding) but even so, extensive proposals on
                            implementation and the formal articles will have to be dealt with de
                            novo in the General Assembly. The decision is therefore some time
                            ahead.</p>
                        <p>The language adopted thus far has not presented insuperable obstacles,
                            and if Congress adopts the Public Accommodations Title of the Civil
                            Rights Bill, these problems will be less. We were in about this same
                            position on the race declaration draft when it came out of the Human
                            Rights Commission last year, but amendments in the General Assembly
                            created great difficulties. We anticipate a similar development.</p>

                        <p>This draft is not so far along as the race convention since it was

                            HUMAN RIGHTS YEAR</p>
                        <p>Throughout its history the United States has attached particular
                            importance to human rights, and welcomes the action designating 1968,
                            the twentieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
                            as International Human Rights Year. We appreciate the efforts of the
                            officers of the committee in preparing the working paper submitted by
                            the chairman,<note n="2" xml:id="d316fn2">Not identified.</note> and
                            offer the following preliminary comments on the issues before the
                            Committee.</p>
                        <p>Dividing the year into periods for emphasis on different aspects of human
                            rights should help greatly in assuring attention in every country to the
                            full scope of the Universal Declaration and the importance of each of
                            the fundamental concepts which give meaning to human dignity and
                            equality. The listing in paragraph 14 indicates a division by months and
                            we would favor this approach. While the suggested headings provide basic
                            coverage, we would like to see greater emphasis on ways individuals can
                            seek protection and redress when they feel their rights have been
                            violated. One possibility would be to associate “the right to effective
                            remedy” with “equality before the law.”</p>
                        <p>We hope that human rights year can strengthen concern for implementation
                            through international as well as national measures. At the international
                            level, Committee 3 discussion of implementation proposals during the
                            19th General Assembly may provide adequate study materials. We are not
                            aware of any comprehensive survey of national machinery. Many countries
                            have recently been moving for improvement, and the Committee should plan
                            promptly to obtain an information document. A study might be undertaken
                            by an expert body such as <pb n="558" xml:id="pg_558" facs="0588"/>the
                            Subcommission on Discrimination and Minorities, or the Secretary General
                            might be asked to prepare an analysis of present institutions.</p>
                        <p>Specific projects along the line of those proposed are the key to citizen
                            participation in human rights observances, as well as to effective
                            cooperation by the many agencies of government. In order to profit by
                            the experience and capacities of both the specialized agencies and
                            non-governmental organizations in consultative status, representatives
                            of these groups might be included in an informal working party to
                            consider these proposals. The non-governmental organizations are in a
                            particularly effective position to relate the objectives of human rights
                            year to the needs of individuals; where these organizations have local
                            programs, they may be able to initiate community audits.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the specific suggestions put forward in the working paper,
                            the US would like to add one proposal, namely, that a permanent human
                            rights exhibit be given a prominent place in the public entrance to UN
                            headquarters. Such an exhibit would contribute to the goal of increasing
                            individual awareness of human rights. Also, with regard to UNESCO, we
                            believe it might be asked to undertake a major effort to enlist the
                            cooperation of academic institutions, in addition to promoting artistic
                            events.</p>
                        <p>We believe it is premature at this time, to make any recommendation with
                            regard to a Conference on Human Rights in 1968. More thorough and
                            careful consideration than has thus far been possible needs to be given
                            to the type and form that the observance and celebration of the 20th
                            Anniversary of the Universal Declaration might take. We do believe,
                            however, that steps can be initiated to prepare the way for an
                            effective, realistic and meaningful celebration. The regional seminars,
                            to be organized in 1966 and 1967 under the Human Rights Advisory
                            Services Program, and which include representatives of non-governmental
                            organizations as well as government representatives, can provide a broad
                            base for consultation on the extent of progress and evaluation of
                            techniques which have been useful in advancing human rights. As
                            necessary, awards under the fellowship program could be used to assure
                            adequate and meaningful documentation.</p>
                        <p>We favor intensification of national efforts in connection with the 1968
                            Human Rights Year, and share the hope that these will aid in the
                            achievement of longstanding objectives. However, we believe the form in
                            which some of these objectives are stated in para. 40 of the working
                            paper tends to diminish the scope and promise of these rights and
                            freedoms. As was demonstrated in the supplementary convention on the
                            abolition of slavery adopted in 1956, understanding of the varied forms
                            of slavery has expanded greatly in the thirty years since the 1926
                            convention was developed under the League of Nations. Similarly, an
                            enlarged understanding is apparent in the declarations and conventions
                            on <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0589"/>discrimination now under
                            consideration in the United Nations, and has also been apparent with
                            regard to the nature of self-determination and independence. One of the
                            virtues of the Universal Declaration is that its implications grow as
                            our understanding grows, and we should be careful not to cut back on its
                            potential scope and increasing impact.</p>
                        <p>For this reason, we suggest that the plan for 1968 take as objectives the
                            organization of national advisory committees and the intensification of
                            educational programs, as recommended in the later sections of Part III,
                            and that the goals listed in para. 40 be made priority items for
                            attention in these committees and programs. We would also favor listing,
                            as a third objective, surveys in depth of the practical application of
                            standards adopted in recent years for the elimination of discrimination,
                            with a view to cooperation between governments and the UN, the ILO,
                            UNESCO and other agencies in evaluating progress. We believe this
                            approach is more realistic and will be more likely to produce the
                            desired results. For example, since all Members of the UN have
                            repudiated slavery as a legal institution, in most cases many years ago,
                            elimination of slavery may be regarded as offering little opportunity
                            for action at the national level. The need for additional measures is
                            therefore more likely to be recognized through the findings of a
                            national advisory committee. While the situation with regard to
                            discrimination is quite different, the complete elimination of
                            discrimination on all grounds, or indeed on any ground, calls for
                            examination of attitudes and often changes in laws or customs which
                            cannot be achieved without an on-going program of community education to
                            counter ignorance and self-righteousness.</p>
                        <p>In addition to leadership on the particular objectives discussed above,
                            national advisory committees can provide grassroots guidance on special
                            problems and opportunities within each country. The documentation
                            assembled by the Human Rights Commission in 1962 is indicative of the
                            variety and positive value of such committees. In many countries the
                            National Commission for UNESCO can also provide leadership. While it is
                            useful to establish a particular group as a national advisory committee
                            in the field of human rights, experience in the United States has
                            demonstrated the advantage of cooperation among a number of different
                            committees and groups, both official and non-governmental.</p>
                        <p>In the same way, educational campaigns at the national level would
                            embrace the special interests of each country along with particular
                            emphases in the international program. Many countries, including the
                            United States have regularly observed December 10 as Human Rights Day,
                            with cooperation from the mass media, schools, civic and other
                            organizations. The Human Rights Year should stimulate still more
                            vigorous educational programs.</p>

                            with Human Rights Year. The plans for this history developed in
                            connection with the Fifteenth Anniversary seem adequate and we have
                            confidence in the Secretary General's capacity to prepare it on his own
                            authority. We see no need for a special editorial board; if the
                            Secretary General has questions regarding earlier human rights documents
                            or other matters in which a particular member state has unique interest,
                            he is free to seek the cooperation of the government concerned.</p>

                        <p>During 1964 human rights issues in the form of racial discrimination and
                            the policy of apartheid began to emerge as issues in multilateral bodies
                            as many African states gained their independence and joined the United
                            Nations. During <gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss>'s first major
                            session of 1964—the Meteorology and Operations Divisional
                            Meeting—African states reacted negatively to the presence of South
                            Africa and Portugal. The United States expressed its dismay at the
                            encroachment of political issues into technical fora and enlisted
                            neutral nations to help. (Telegram 1018 to Bern and telegram 442 from

                        <p>By July the Organization of African Unity announced a new policy of
                            isolation of states that practiced apartheid, a position that threatened
                            to disrupt the <gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss>'s upcoming

                            excluding South Africa and Portugal. On November 10 the Department told
                            the U.S. Mission to the United Nations that “Department understands

                            to attempt head off expected African action.” The Mission was instructed
                            to solicit the Secretary-General's intervention and to emphasize the
                            “desirability of confining technical meetings to technical problems and
                            leaving political issues to appropriate UN bodies.” (Telegram 1135 to
                            USUN, November 10; ibid.) The Mission responded that the
                            Secretary-General was getting “cold feet” on such matters and wished the
                                <gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss> “to handle the matter itself.”

                            Committee, recommendations were made over strong United States
                            opposition that (1) the General Assembly be asked to “convene a United
                            Nations Conference on Human Rights” for various purposes,<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d318fn3">Although the U.S. delegation had been authorized to

                                “conference,” the United States only supported such a meeting if it

                                Assembly. The Department warned the delegation: “You should take all
                                necessary steps to head off Committee decisions which would preclude
                                arrangements along above lines.” (Telegram 1214 to USUN, November

                        <p>Prior to the meeting, the United States, after hard and long
                            negotiations, convinced members of the Sub-Group dealing with the
                            Conference (Costa Rica and Turkey) that the recommendations, such as
                            above, were completely unacceptable to the United States if United
                            States support for the conference was desired. Volio (Costa Rica) agreed
                            and accepted the idea that the conference must be kept within the
                            confines of the General Assembly, and financial implications, if any,
                            must be kept minimal and within the resources of the advisory services

                            Turkey and presented to the Working Group, has been pouched to the
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>At the beginning of the meeting, it became apparent that the Committee
                            Chairman, <persName corresp="#p_RER1">Richardson</persName> (Jamaica),
                            disliked the Sub-Group report and the contents of the Resolution.
                            Whereupon, he proceeded to launch <pb n="562" xml:id="pg_562"
                                facs="0592"/>a vicious campaign to persuade the weak delegates that
                            the Resolution was, in effect, designed to kill the idea of a
                            conference. In the course of his remarks regarding this point, he called
                            the United Nations Secretary-General “overlord of the Human Rights
                            Commission who doesn't think much of it anyway.” He called the Human
                            Rights Commission incompetent, ineffective, and said that it was killing
                            United Nations initiatives in Human Rights, that it was unrepresentative
                            of the United Nations, and that the best way to make sure that any
                            conference on human rights was ruined was to let the Human Rights
                            Commission participate in its organization. Furthermore, he stated that
                            the present members on the Human Rights Commission had no interest in
                            human rights.</p>
                        <p>He refused to permit the delegates to ask questions of the Secretariat,
                            and when questions were asked he refused to permit the Secretariat to
                            answer if the answers might be contrary to the <persName
                                corresp="#p_RER1">Richardson</persName> position. As on previous
                            occasions, he insulted the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                            refused to permit the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, under heavy
                            fire by the United States, to withdraw the suggestion that the General
                            Assembly be asked to decide the composition of any Preparatory Committee
                            for the Conference.</p>
                        <p>This incredible performance overpowered the weaker delegates, who folded
                            completely, including Costa Rica and Turkey. The Mission Officer
                            believes Costa Rican capitulation was due solely to Volio's unfortunate
                            absence from the Committee Room. His alternate Redondo was not
                            adequately briefed on the nature of the situation and did not know that
                            the agreement was to stick to the carefully negotiated text. The Turkish
                            Delegate (Tarlan), young and inexperienced in the United Nations, even
                            said that his government would support the conference after the
                            twenty-third General Assembly ended. The United Kingdom Delegate
                            (Taylor) confessed that he had no idea what the matter was all about.
                            Initially the Philippines supported the United States, but folded when
                            other <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s did.</p>
                        <p>At USUN initiative today, Costa Rica and Turkey were contacted regarding
                            the Friday fiasco. Redondo's ignorance of the agreed text was confirmed.
                            Tarlan is reconsidering and will discuss the matter. The Philippines is
                            also being contacted. The United States Representative is hopeful that
                            the original text will prevail in the Committee despite <persName
                                corresp="#p_RER1">Richardson</persName> tactics.</p>
                        <p>The United States put forward, in no uncertain terms, its position
                            outlined in <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1214 and stated
                            further its unalterable opposition to such procedures, tactics and
                            recommendations now being accepted by the Working Group. It stated
                            flatly that it could not support any attempt to hold another <gloss
                                target="#t_UNCTAD1">UNCTAD</gloss>-style conference. Note:
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TMF1">Tree</persName> told the Mission
                            Officer that <persName corresp="#p_RER1">Richardson</persName> told her
                            the evening of November 19 that he is determined to hold the conference
                            outside the <pb n="563" xml:id="pg_563" facs="0593"/>General Assembly,
                            and that the United States would now support the idea, although France
                            and the Bloc would be against this.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RER1">Richardson</persName> told Williams the
                            evening of November 20 that “your boys” giving him hard time and that he
                                (<persName corresp="#p_RER1">Richardson</persName>) wanted a
                            specialized agency for human rights and the conference independent of
                            the General Assembly, as this was the only way to get the SA. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RER1">Richardson</persName> also told Williams that some
                            Big Power had to support the idea, and he hoped the United States would.
                            But since the United States did not, perhaps <persName
                                corresp="#p_CLHMF1">Lord Caradon</persName> (U.K.) would support the
                            idea when he returned. This determination is now evident and <persName
                                corresp="#p_RER1">Richardson</persName> seemingly will settle for
                            nothing less.</p>
                        <p>During a heated exchange between the United States and <persName
                                corresp="#p_RER1">Richardson</persName> over the financial
                            implications, <persName corresp="#p_RER1">Richardson</persName> gave
                            figures of past conference. When the United States inquired of the
                            Secretariat for further information, <persName corresp="#p_RER1"
                                >Richardson</persName> refused to permit the Secretariat to answer.
                            Note: Figures quoted by <persName corresp="#p_RER1"
                                >Richardson</persName> had been shown to the Mission Officer earlier
                            by Volio who admitted that they represented only what the United Nations
                            paid and omitted the sums contributed by the host governments.</p>
                        <p>Due to the United States' bitter opposition and the unavailability of the
                            text in Russian, the Working Group must meet again to reconsider the
                            Sub-Group report. <persName corresp="#p_RER1">Richardson</persName> is
                            certain to offer bitter opposition to further discussion of the

                                from Rome, November 23, the Embassy reported: “At first plenary
                                session of <gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss> African meeting the
                                United Arab Republic read the following statement which represented

                                plenary. ‘The African states regret the presence of Portugal and
                                South Africa and wish to place on record that they will not
                                participate in any discussions initiated by these countries.'”
                                (Ibid.)</note> African states appear adopting technique of walking
                            out of committees and working groups whenever the subject of discussion
                            is a route, circuit, airport or other aeronautical facility connecting
                            Portuguese territory or South Africa with any other African state or
                            which supports an operation from or to Portuguese territory or South
                            Africa which overflies any other African state. They hope by this to, in
                            effect, black out of the regional plan all routes, circuits, etc. into
                            and out of such areas. Not yet clear whether this technique will be
                            completely effective. <gloss target="#t_IATA1">IATA</gloss> may be
                            willing and able in the committees and working groups to fill
                            informational gaps. Additionally, attitude of Portugal and South Africa
                            in these meetings may be of significance. So far it appears South Africa
                            will generally remain silent and not initiate any proposals, but
                            Portugal adopting much more aggressive attitude which could cause more
                            difficulties. There are several possible consequences this action.
                            First, black out may be successful, thus meeting can only produce a
                            regional plan not including South Africa or Portuguese territory which
                            obviously of doubtful value, not what meeting was convened for and, in
                            fact, not responsive to <gloss target="#t_ANC1">ANC</gloss>
                                directives.<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> urges us go along with
                            this result calling it “limited success.” Binaghi also appears to want
                            us to go along stating that while this activity violation of spirit of
                            convention and directives, he does not consider it illegal. Binaghi
                            further says defective plan would be to Council and <gloss
                                target="#t_ANC1">ANC</gloss> where it can be dealt with.</p>
                        <p>Another possible outcome of walkout technique is that necessary
                            information may be supplied by others such as <gloss target="#t_IATA1"
                                >IATA</gloss>, South Africa and Portugal during absence of African
                            delegates, and committees and <pb n="565" xml:id="pg_565" facs="0595"
                            />working groups complete plan using this information. Since in all
                            cases African delegates reserving decisions taken during absence, the
                            reports of committees will then be subject to revision when referred to
                            higher levels of conference or final plenary. Since African states have
                            clear majority in these meetings, the plan will almost certainly be
                            revised to again black out data for South Africa and Portuguese
                            territory. However, in this situation, since basic plan had been
                            produced, Council or <gloss target="#t_ANC1">ANC</gloss> possibly could
                            disregard action of final plenary and publish unexpurgated regional
                            plan.</p>
                        <p>Another possible alternative is that a committee or working group, being
                            unable to proceed because of walkout, will refer matter to sub-committee
                            one, highest level short of plenary, where basic issue of expulsion may
                            again erupt. <persName corresp="#p_BWA2">Binaghi</persName> urging that
                            this not occur since in his view once it is necessary to take a position
                            in public, all African states will vote for expulsion. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWA2">Binaghi</persName> states that he has been able to
                            keep meeting under control only through device of arranging private
                            African states only meetings at which their differences can be aired in
                            private and in which moderates can be most effective.</p>
                        <p>It appears first test of last mentioned alternative may occur Friday.

                            from other African states, 2) routes to and from such areas which
                            overfly African states and 3) routes into and out of Israel which
                            overfly Arab states. Binaghi does not believe expulsion issue will arise
                            at this first test. US del proposes low key opposition to deletion of
                            such routes on grounds that it contrary to directives of <gloss

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Gardner</persName> invited participants to comment on the
                            proposal, (1) in relation to the U.S. domestic situation and (2) in
                            relation to our foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>On the domestic side, Burke Marshall and others raised the possibility
                            that U.S. groups agitating in the race relations field would take
                            advantage of a UN Commissioner on Human Rights to seek further
                            publicity. Ambassador Williams pointed out that such U.S. groups are
                            already appealing directly to foreign delegations in New York, so that
                            the establishment of a Human Rights Commissioner in the United Nations
                            would not create a new situation. On the contrary, a balanced and
                            objective human rights reporting system would be helpful and was
                            urgently needed to offset the ignorance and disbelief in New York with
                            respect to U.S. progress in eliminating race discrimination—the U.S. was
                            already exposed and the situation could not be worse.</p>
                        <p>Some thought the reports of a Human Rights Commissioner might naturally
                            tend to focus on the “open” societies, such as the U.S., whose problems
                            are a matter of public record and neglect the “closed” societies, such
                            as the U.S.S.R., in which not even the existence of human rights
                            problems is publicly acknowledged. In answer it was pointed out that
                            there are many and various independent sources of information on the
                            U.S.S.R. that the Commissioner could draw upon. Moreover, the
                            Commissioner's report would be studied in the Human Rights <pb n="570"
                                xml:id="pg_570" facs="0600"/>Commission and in the Sub-Commission on
                            the Prevention of Discrimination and the Protection of Minorities, as
                            well as in <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>, thereby giving
                            both experts and government representatives an opportunity to criticize
                            and rebut it.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the discussion great emphasis was placed on drawing the terms
                            of reference so as to definitively limit the powers of the Commissioner.
                            Everyone agreed the Commissioner should function only as a reporter and
                            not be allowed to become an investigator.</p>
                        <p>On the foreign policy side, questions were raised as to the U.S. position
                            in case a Commissioner report exposed serious human rights violations or
                            malpractice in countries, such as the GRC, ROK and RVN, which are known
                            to be receiving major support from the U.S.</p>
                        <p>No final agreement was reached. Mr. <persName>Gardner</persName>
                            indicated that the original memo would be revised in the light of the
                            discussion and of proposals already in circulation at the United
                                Nations.<note n="2" xml:id="d323fn2">On December 13, 1965, the U.S.
                                Representatives in Committee III of the UN General Assembly made a
                                statement supporting the proposal to create the post of UN High
                                Commissioner, and on December 16 the General Assembly adopted a
                                resolution that referred the proposal to the Commission on Human
                                Rights. See American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1965, p.
                                156. On March 30, 1966, the Commission decided to establish a
                                working group of nine states (including the United States) to study
                                the proposal for a High Commissioner for Human Rights and report the
                                results to the Commission at its 23d session in 1967; see ibid.,
                                1966, pp. 93–94. Action was postponed through 1971; an alternative
                                resolution was adopted in 1973.</note>

                                >ICAO</gloss> Assembly in June 1965, South Africa and Portugal
                            sought to rally support and prevent their expulsion from the
                            organization. On June 2, 1965, the South Africans submitted an
                            aide-mémoire to the Department of State, in part arguing: “The expulsion
                            of a member state from such a technical organisation in circumstances
                            where the United Nations itself has not attempted such a step would not
                            only be contrary to the spirit and letter of the convention of <gloss

                            established.” (South African aide-mémoire, June 2; National Archives and

                        <p>Portugal also asked the Department for support. On June 17 Assistant
                            Secretary Sisco assured the Portuguese Minister that the U.S. position
                            was “to oppose political discussions in and attempts to preempt UN
                            political powers by UN technical organs,” and “to oppose
                            unconstitutional resolutions seeking to exclude members or otherwise
                            encumber their membership.” (Memorandum of conversation, June 17;

                        <p>Before the conference, on June 9 British officials visited the Department
                            to lay out their intended course of action and to explain that they were
                            making similar approaches to other European states and to other members
                            of the Commonwealth. (Memorandum of conversation, June 9; ibid.)
                            According to the Embassy in Bonn, the Germans expressed “apprehension”
                            over the growing political activities of the <gloss target="#t_LDC1"
                                >LDC</gloss>s within UN specialized agencies, but “US counter-action
                            has been muted, however, by recognition that active initiative against
                            African exclusion maneuvers in any one agency (over Afro-Asian-Communist
                            voting bloc of nearly two-thirds members) likely result in cumulative
                            Afro-Asian opposition to Western interests in more crucial situation.
                            Our experience has shown most Western states have reached same
                            conclusion and are most reluctant to take any lead to block Afro-Asian
                            drive against Portugal and South Africa.” (Telegram 3826 from Bonn, June

                            change from anticipated scenario, from our standpoint, has been
                            virtually complete absence of criticism of U.S. over its racial problems
                            and policies. We attribute this to Wilkins' statement and presence.
                            Needless to say, it greatly facilitates our task. We believe impact of
                            Wilkins' activities will continue to be felt throughout Conference.”</p>

                        <p>Dr. Abernathy opened the meeting, introduced a series of speakers who
                            addressed their grievances to me, and stated that he and his followers
                            would return in ten days to see what response was forthcoming. (Speakers

                                speakers included the Reverend Jesse Jackson of Operation

                        <p>At the close of the meeting, I promised to consider the grievances
                            expressed, to consult with my Cabinet colleagues on points outside my
                            jurisdiction, and to examine and respond to specific grievances that
                            fell within the purview of my Department.</p>
                        <p>It was apparent at the meeting that the spokesmen for the group were
                            poorly informed and that the first need was to provide them with
                            adequate information on the subjects of their concern. I propose that
                            information relating to legitimate grievances be drawn up to serve as a
                            basis for discussion with Dr. Abernathy and his group when they return.

                                    Mexico, set the Rio Grande as the southern boundary of Texas,
                                    and ceded the future states of California and New Mexico to the
                                    United States. A controversial clause in the treaty promised
                                    that the present landowners, their heirs, or “all Mexicans who
                                    may hereafter acquire said property by contract,” should have

                        <p rend="flushleft">Dear Dr. Abernathy:</p>
                        <p>At our meeting on May 1,<note n="2" xml:id="d331fn2">See <ref
                                    target="#d330">Document 330</ref>.</note> I took note of the
                            grievances which were expressed and to which I felt this Department
                            could respond. I am writing now to convey my response and to transmit to
                            you selected background information on the subjects of concern to
                            representatives of the Poor People's Campaign.</p>
                        <p>A number of the representatives demanded an end to the war in Vietnam. As
                            you know, the President on March 31 took a major unilateral action to
                            de-escalate the conflict and, as a result of this initiative, talks with
                            representatives of North Vietnam have now begun in Paris.</p>
                        <p>One of the representatives stated that United States relations with South
                            Africa, Rhodesia, and Portugal support racist societies abroad and
                            thereby serve to undermine national goals and policies of racial
                            equality. A careful reading of our policies toward these countries,
                            which are explained in Attachment A,<note n="3" xml:id="d331fn3">None of
                                the attachments is printed.</note> will not support that view.</p>
                        <p>The United States has supported fully, and will continue to support, the
                            Security Council program of economic sanctions directed against the
                            white minority regime in Southern Rhodesia.</p>
                        <p>The United States has maintained that the people of Portuguese territory
                            in Africa are entitled to the right of self-determination and has
                            constantly urged Portugal both publicly and privately to accept this
                            principle. Department regulations for a number of years also have
                            forbidden the supply of military equipment for use in Portuguese Africa
                            by either public or private American sources and have prohibited
                            Portugal from diverting to Africa any of the small quantities of
                            military equipment which we sell or provide for use in the NATO
                            area.</p>
                        <p>The United States has taken every opportunity both in international
                            forums and in bilateral relations with South Africa to express the view
                            that the apartheid practices of that government are damaging to human
                            relations in South Africa and to South Africa's own interests. <pb
                                n="580" xml:id="pg_580" facs="0610"/>Since 1963, the United States
                            has stopped all sales to South Africa of arms, military equipment, and
                            materials for their manufacture and maintenance. The Department has
                            supported self-determination for the inhabitants of the former mandated
                            territory of Southwest Africa and has expressed the view that proposals
                            presently before the South Africa parliament to apply de facto apartheid
                            to this territory are illegal.</p>
                        <p>In sum, our policies in Southern Africa are based on support for majority
                            rule, human rights, and self-determination. We are constantly seeking
                            ways to strengthen the application of these principles.</p>
                        <p>A series of grievances were aimed at our program of foreign economic
                            assistance. It was stated that assistance should not be given to the
                            poor in other countries when there is so much poverty at home. As
                            explained in Attachment B, we do not believe that economic aid programs
                            to the poor nations of Africa, Asia and Latin America (which now account
                            for 1.5% of the federal budget) are conducted at the expense of programs
                            to help the poor in the United States. Close to 90% of foreign aid
                            appropriations are spent at home, creating jobs and expanding domestic
                            production.</p>
                        <p>You will understand that just as the majority of affluent in this country
                            cannot isolate themselves from the minority of poor Americans, so the
                            United States as one of the small minority of rich nations cannot
                            isolate itself safely from the aspirations of the desperately poor
                            majority.</p>
                        <p>It also was stated that aid funds were being used to support dictators in
                            Latin America. There is a popular misconception, discussed in Attachment
                            C, that Latin America is a land of dictatorship when, in fact, 21 of the
                            24 governments now in office in Latin America were freely elected.</p>
                        <p>United States assistance programs have given and will continue to give,
                            overwhelming priority to economic and social development. As explained
                            in Attachment D, less than four per cent of our aid consists of military
                            assistance. Both the percentage of gross national product expended in
                            defense budgets (1.7%) and the percentage of the population in the armed
                            forces (.34%) in Latin America are among the lowest in the world.</p>
                        <p>U.S. aid policy toward Latin America will continue to be carried out
                            under the terms of the Alliance for Progress which call for serious
                            efforts on the part of nations there to undertake social reforms and
                            develop political and economic institutions which are responsive to the
                            will and needs of the people.</p>
                        <p>A third grievance relating to aid policy concerned the use abroad of
                            fortified foods which are not available to the poor people at home. A
                            memorandum examining this question is enclosed as Attachment E. <pb
                                n="581" xml:id="pg_581" facs="0611"/>It has been and will continue
                            to be our policy, that no food (fortified or otherwise) will be sent
                            abroad until distribution requirements of existing government domestic
                            programs are met.</p>
                        <p>Several representatives of Mexican American interests stated that land
                            rights guaranteed to them by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo have not
                            been enforced. This and related grievances are discussed in the letter
                            to me from Mr. <persName>Vicente Ximenes</persName>, Chairman of the
                            Inter-Agency Cabinet Committee on Mexican American Affairs, which is
                            enclosed as Attachment F.</p>
                        <p>These same representatives also expressed concern over immigration
                            policies and the regulation of Green Card holders. In recent years the
                            influx of both seasonal and permanent alien workers has dropped sharply.
                            Green Card holders who commute from their homes in Mexico to jobs in the
                            United States are being strictly controlled by recent regulation.
                            Controls over resident Green Card holders would require legislation.</p>
                        <p>On the general subject of Mexican American affairs, it should be noted
                            that President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> has
                            undertaken significant new measures, strongly supported by this
                            Department, to improve the quality of life of Mexican American citizens.
                            I am enclosing a brochure and statement of the President about these
                            programs as Attachment G.</p>
                        <p>One of the representatives, speaking on behalf of Indian interests,
                            stated that the Department was not protecting Indian fishing rights
                            guaranteed by treaty. With the exception of an article in the North
                            Pacific Fur Seals convention, we cannot identify special Indian fishing
                            rights guaranteed by international treaty.</p>
                        <p>The Department endeavors to protect the fishing interests of Indian and
                            Eskimo fishermen as explained in Attachment H. For example, continuing
                            pressure has been maintained on Japanese fishing operations north of the
                            Bering Strait which present a threat to the livelihood of natives of
                            Northwest Alaska. As a result, the Government of Japan has not permitted
                            the expansion of those operations.</p>
                        <p>A special question was raised concerning Department of Defense employment
                            of natives in Alaska. I can report, on the basis of information provided
                            by the Defense Department and enclosed as Attachment I, that intensified
                            efforts are being made by the Alaskan Command to locate a maximum number
                            of Alaskan natives for anticipated job vacancies. The Defense Department
                            is represented on the Committee on Alaskan Hire which is developing
                            plans to overcome the difficulties of recruitment in remote areas and
                            the lack of training of Alaskan natives. The proposal currently being
                            considered by the Committee calls for establishing a number of training
                            positions roughly equivalent to 10% of the current Federal work force in
                            Alaska.</p>
                        <pb n="582" xml:id="pg_582" facs="0612"/>
                        <p>Grievances concerning the draft have been referred to the Deputy Director
                            of the Selective Service System who is preparing a response which will
                            be transmitted to you shortly.</p>
                        <p>I sensed throughout our meeting that the specific grievances to which I
                            am now responding were symptoms of a much deeper, more general grievance
                            concerning the allocation of this country's resources as between
                            domestic and foreign affairs. In the parlance of the day, your
                            representatives were concerned, as we all are, about “priorities.”</p>
                        <p>In light of emerging domestic problems this nation will be debating anew
                            what proportion of our resources should be allocated to the dual
                            national purposes of protecting security and promoting our welfare. I
                            hope that as this debate takes place it will be remembered that without
                            security there can be no welfare, that our past investment in security
                            has brought us all safely, through a dangerous passage, into the present
                            day, and that it is neither easy nor inexpensive to help organize an
                            enduring peace in the world.</p>
                        <p>I hope you find this letter, and the materials we have taken care to
                            prepare, responsive to the grievances which were directed to this
                            Department. I will be transmitting additional materials to you and will
                            be pleased to respond to any further inquiry or request that you may
                                have.<note n="4" xml:id="d331fn4">An enclosure to a June 14 letter

                        </list>
                        <p>The President's Commission for the Observance of Human Rights Year 1968
                            recommends that a White House Conference on the Advancement of Human
                            Rights be scheduled for Wednesday, December 4. The one-day conference
                            would follow a Commission meeting on December 3, so that out-of-town
                            members of the Commission could participate conveniently in the
                            conference. The December 4 date would avoid any conflict with the
                            celebration of Human Rights Day on December 10 at the United Nations.
                            The Commission recommends that the President either address the
                            conference, to be held in the Department of State, or receive the
                            participants in the White House.</p>
                        <p>The President's Commission had developed close relationships with many of
                            the non-governmental organizations that are active in the field of human
                            rights and United Nations affairs. One of its members, Mr.
                                <persName>Bruno</persName> V. Bitker,<note n="2" xml:id="d333fn2"

                                    >Document 328</ref>.</note> is Chairman of a Special Committee
                            on Non-Governmental Organizations, which provides liaison with these
                            groups during Human Rights Year. The Commission hopes that
                            representatives of many of these organizations, as well as the leaders
                            of civil rights agencies, could meet together to commemorate Human
                            Rights Year and to discuss the most urgent needs for the future.</p>
                        <p>Participation in such a White House Conference would give the President,
                            during his final weeks in office, an unparalleled opportunity to voice
                            his views on future needs and problems in the field of human
                                rights.<note n="3" xml:id="d333fn3">On December 4 President

                            Refugees to the Senate for ratification. This protocol was the eighth
                            convention on human rights submitted to the Senate since the founding of
                            the United Nations. Hearings were held on the Genocide Convention
                            (1950); the Convention on Employment Policy <pb n="586" xml:id="pg_586"
                                facs="0616"/>(1966); and the Supplementary Convention on Slavery,
                            the Forced Labor Convention, and the U.N. Convention on the Political
                            Rights of Women (1967). No hearings had ever been held on the
                            Inter-American Convention on the Political Rights of Women and the
                            Convention on Freedom of Association. Of these, only the Slavery
                            Convention had been ratified in 1967. (Press release of the President's

                        <p>The President urged the Senate to ratify the convention on refugees,
                            which prohibited expulsion or return of refugees to any country in which
                            they would face persecution, arguing that it was in the interest of the
                            United States to do so: “Given the American heritage of concern for the
                            homeless and persecuted, and our traditional role of leadership in
                            promoting assistance for refugees, accession by the United States to the
                            Protocol would lend conspicuous support to the effort of the United

                            and ultimately depends on the quality of life of the people governed.
                            The quality of that life depends on the interest and willingness and
                            capacity of each country to assure and to respect human rights… . These
                            human rights conventions are an expression of principles that have

                            enlightened government… . The United States Senate should move forward
                            on international human rights conventions, just as the Congress has

                            immediately, as United States Representative to the United Nations

                                representative from 1965 to 1968.</note> In so doing, I want to
                            declare my heartfelt appreciation for the strong support you gave to the
                            work of our delegation. I also would like to express my great respect
                            for your deep commitment to the purposes of the United Nations
                            Commission on Human Rights—the illumination and expansion of individual

                                his memorandum <persName corresp="#p_AMB1">Abram</persName>
                                emphasized the continuity between the foreign and domestic policies
                                of the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration. For example, he
                                noted that Americans and other Westerners understood rights such as
                                freedom of speech or the press that protected citizens from the
                                state, but had difficulty accepting as basic rights other principles
                                which flowed from the labor or socialist movements: “Americans have
                                been unaccustomed to and have seriously questioned the notion that
                                individuals also have a basic right to a job, to leisure, education,
                                medical care, housing and social security. The
                                    <persName>Johnson</persName> Administration, through its 'War on
                                Poverty' has taken strong economic and social steps to encourage
                                wider public acceptance of this idea and to implement these rights.
                                Nevertheless, some Americans still do not understand that the
                                Universal Declaration's economic and social rights, like our own
                                Constitution's political safeguards, are not luxuries, but
                                necessities for a free and viable society.”</note> recording the
                            accomplishments of your administration in the area of international
                            human rights and some of my thoughts on the future.</p>
                        <p>Your administration's policies have been laudably exemplified by an
                            attempt at a more even-handed treatment of the problems of human rights.
                            Under your leadership, we have taken the first steps in seeking from
                            such issues not short-term political advantages but the establishment
                            and, perhaps, the implementation of just principles which in the
                            long-run will serve not our nation alone, but all mankind.</p>
                        <p>Your administration has actively supported the proposal of a High
                            Commissioner for Human Rights who could investigate and negotiate human
                            rights controversies and, when necessary, turn the powerful searchlight
                            of world attention on gross violations. Its delegates helped draft the
                            Teheran Proclamation which committed to the Universal Declaration of
                            Human Rights states that had not signed it in 1948— <pb n="588"
                                xml:id="pg_588" facs="0618"/>including the Soviet Union and the many
                            new nations. Our Government has supported extension of the human rights
                            concept to include provision for legal counsel and the right of the
                            parents to decide the number and spacing of their children.</p>
                        <p>You have given leadership to the fight against anti-Semitism in certain
                            Communist countries, authorizing our delegates to speak openly and
                            frankly about this age-old evil. Your administration and my tenure have
                            seen real progress in the drafting and adoption by the United Nations of
                            the Declaration and International Convention on the Elimination of all
                            forms of Racial Discrimination, and the drafting of a Declaration and
                            Convention on Intolerance and Discrimination based on Religion or
                            Belief, which, I hope, will eventually emerge in satisfactory form. You
                            have vigorously used the initiative of your office to push for the
                            ratification of certain human rights conventions, although both you and
                            I have been dissatisfied by the response these efforts have received.
                            Finally, your enthusiastic involvement in the activities of the
                            International Year for Human Rights has been crucial in focusing public
                            attention upon it.</p>
                        <p>If one single thing must characterize my experience on the Human Rights
                            Commission, it is this: for the first time in the history of the
                            Commission, the men and women who speak for America no longer needed to
                            apologize for or equivocate about our national policy in matters of
                                race.<note n="4" xml:id="d335fn4">“One of the most significant
                                arenas of human rights progress has been the American domestic
                                scene,” <persName corresp="#p_AMB1">Abram</persName> wrote in his
                                attached memorandum. “For the first time in the history of the
                                Commission on Human Rights, we have not had to apologize for or
                                equivocate about our national policy in matters of race.” <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AMB1">Abram</persName> also included a caveat:
                                “Unless we succeed in solving our own racial and other human rights
                                problems, we may find we are forfeiting our position of leadership
                                and the respect of those many new States to whom questions of racism
                                and exploitation are paramount.”</note> You and your
                            administration—by your firm words, by your legislative program, and by
                            your administrative actions—have made clear to the world the
                            determination of the Government of the United States to end once and for
                            all time the terrible burden of institutionalized or sanctioned racial
                            discrimination.</p>
                        <p>With these thoughts indelibly in mind, I want again to thank you for
                            allowing me the honor and satisfaction of serving our country in these
                            challenging times.</p>
