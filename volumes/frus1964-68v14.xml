                <p>Foreign Relations of the United States 1964–1968, Volume XIV, Soviet Union </p>
                <p>The documentary record of United States bilateral relations with the Soviet Union during the
     Presidency of <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName> is presented in <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> of the United States, 1964–1968, Volume XIV, Soviet
     Union, released today by the Department of State. During 1964–1968, the United States and the
     Soviet Union negotiated the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and concluded several accords of
     lesser magnitude, but the most significant achievement in East-West relations was the avoidance
     of outright confrontation in Southeast Asia. </p>
                <p>By the time the new Soviet leadership had settled in sufficiently to contemplate more
     important agreements with the United States, the escalation of the war in Vietnam had led to a
     Soviet determination that to maintain its leadership of the Communist movement, the Soviet
     Union must be seen as a staunch defender of its Vietnamese ally. This precluded major measures
     of détente. </p>
                <p>When the United States bombed Hanoi during a visit by Khrushchev's successor,
     Alexsei Kosygin, in early 1965, relations plummeted. Orchestrated demonstrations against the
     U.S. Embassy in Moscow were followed by open hostility from Soviet leaders for this act of U.S.
     “aggression” against a sister socialist state. For most of the next 2
     years, U.S.-Soviet relations were in a “controlled freeze."</p>
                <p>The Soviet Union had long been annoyed with the U.S. practice of welcoming Soviet defectors
     with open arms. This problem reached a boiling point in March 1967 when the late Soviet
     dictator Joseph Stalin's daughter, Svetlana Alliluyeva, walked into the U.S. Embassy
     in New Delhi and was subsequently granted asylum in the United States. This would have caused a
     Soviet uproar under any circumstances, but at this time of poor relations with the United
     States, the Soviet Government was particularly furious and charged that the United States was
     inciting Alliluyeva to make anti-Soviet statements as part of a larger propaganda campaign. In
     part to avoid unnecessary complications in U.S.-Soviet relations, the Department of State
     agreed in December 1967 that Moscow would be notified of Soviet defectors and be allowed to
     talk to them before political asylum was granted. </p>
                <p>Toward the end of the Johnson administration, however, the convergence of national interests
     between Moscow and Washington began to produce agreements, or at least progress, on some
     issues, including cultural affairs, civil aviation, outer space, and nuclear non-proliferation.
     In June 1967 the leaders of the two nations held a summit meeting at Glassboro, New Jersey, in
     part to project an image of reasonableness after their respective allies in the Middle East,
     Israel and Egypt, fought the Six-Day War. Although President Johnson and Chairman Kosygin hit
     it off reasonably well, the talks were inconclusive and little was agreed upon. While the
     “Spirit of Glassboro” was perhaps more cosmetic than substance, at least
     the leaders were meeting face to face again. </p>
                <p>In addition to summitry, during the last 2 years of his presidency Johnson pressed the
     Kremlin for a strategic arms control agreement, but the Soviet leaders delayed it by insisting
     on linkage with settlements in the Middle East and Vietnam. In August 1968, the two sides
     agreed to begin talks on limiting offensive strategic nuclear weapons and anti-ballistic
     missile defense systems and also agreed to hold another summit. On the eve of the announcement
     of these formal talks and another summit, Warsaw Pact troops invaded Czechoslovakia. Even after
     the Soviet Union crushed the Prague Spring, President Johnson still wanted to end his term with
     a U.S.-Soviet summit. His hopes were finally dashed in November by the election of Richard
     Nixon. The President-elect and his adviser Henry Kissinger made it clear to Soviet leaders that
     the incoming leaders had their own plans for negotiating with the Soviet Union and that any
     last-minute summit with President Johnson would only start the Kremlin off on the wrong foot
     with the new administration. The Johnson administration policy toward the Soviet Union, begun
     with modest expectations and buoyed with occasional high points, ultimately failed to achieve
     much progress, mostly because of Vietnam and the Soviets' conclusion that détente with
     the West during the war there would seriously weaken its position in the Communist bloc. </p>
                <p>This volume complements extensive coverage of Soviet-related issues in other Foreign
     Relations volumes on the Johnson administration. In particular, it supplements the treatment of
     arms control in Volume XI, national security policy in Volume X, relations with the Soviets
     over Eastern Europe in Volume XVII, and U.S. Soviet conflict and cooperation over Vietnam in
     Volumes I–VII. For the full context of U.S.-Soviet relations in these years, readers are
     encouraged to consult these other volumes.</p>

                <p>Since 1861, the Department of State's documentary series <hi rend="italic">Foreign
      Relations of the United States</hi> has constituted the official record of the foreign policy

     and annotate the principal documents that make up the record of American foreign policy. The
     standards for the preparation of the series and the general deadlines for its publication are
     established by the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> statute of
     October 28, 1991 (22 USC 4351, et seq.). Volumes in the Foreign Relations series are published
     when all the necessary editing, declassification, and printing steps have been completed.</p>
                <p>The documents in this volume are drawn from the centralized indexed files of the Department

     units. The editors also make extensive use of Presidential and other papers at the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName> Library in Austin, Texas, as well as recordings
     of President Johnson' telephone conversations. In addition, the volume includes
     records of the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>

                </p>
                <p>During the Johnson presidency the United States and the Soviet Union negotiated the Nuclear
     Non-Proliferation Treaty, concluded several accords of lesser magnitude, and managed to avoid
     confrontation during a period of instability in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, but it was
     not a period of substantial forward movement in U.S.-Soviet relations. U.S. policymakers had
     only modest expectations at the outset, and these were jolted by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Nikita Khrushchev</persName>' ouster in 1964 and dampened considerably by the
     hostile reaction of his successors to the escalation of the Vietnam war. Relations deteriorated
     during 1965 and approached a freeze on the Soviets' part for much of the following 2
     years, although a convergence of national interests did produce agreements on some issues, and
     in 1967 the leaders of the two nations held a summit meeting at Glassboro, New Jersey. During
     the last 2 years of his presidency Johnson pressed the Kremlin for a strategic arms control
     agreement, but the Soviet leaders delayed it by linking it to settlements in the Middle East
     and Vietnam. In August 1968, on the eve of the announcement of formal talks and a summit,
     Warsaw Pact troops invaded Czechoslovakia. The White House' fading hopes for a
     summit were undercut even further in November by the election of <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard Nixon</persName>, who had plans of his own for negotiating with the Soviet Union and
     made sure that Moscow knew it.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Opening Moves: The Johnson Administration and the Kremlin </p>
                <p>As 1963 drew to a close, Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin proposed that President Johnson
     and Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> hold a summit meeting in 1964.
     In January, however, Johnson' national security adviser, McGeorge Bundy, told
      <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that a summit would be hard to arrange given
     the “great political difficulties standing between the President and a trip outside
     the country.” In any case, he did not think it advisable unless they found some
     “very large new step forward" that was not then on the horizon. At the same time,
     Secretary of State Dean <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, in a talk with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> General Secretary Paul-Henri Spaak, saw only modest
     possibilities of solving bilateral problems with the Soviets and little prospect of any
     far-reaching multilateral agreements. (5–7)</p>
                <p>The intelligence input to U.S. policymaking supported <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>' limited expectation of diplomatic advances with the Soviet Union.
     The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> reported in January 1964 that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> wanted to finance a new program to modernize Soviet
     farming in part from large and long-term Western credits. It assumed that Moscow would try to
     hold down defense and space outlays so as to release scarce resources for investment in the
     civilian economy. The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> cautioned, however, that this would
     only help to soften the tone of Soviet foreign policy and would not lead to major concessions
     of substance. A second <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> study issued a month later
     reiterated that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> wished to economize on
     defense and needed an improved international climate to do so but that basic settlements with
     the West depended on more fundamental shifts in Soviet outlook than any then in prospect. The
     study rated <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>' power position as
     strong enough to keep his somewhat conciliatory foreign policy on track over the next year or
     so. (4, 11)</p>
                <p>
                    <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> continued to doubt the Soviet capacity for
     flexibility in spite of Moscow' bids to reduce cold war tensions by establishing
     closer economic ties. Alexsei Kosygin, then Soviet First Deputy Premier, received Under
     Secretary of Commerce Clarence Martin in March 1964 and expressed interest in a long-term trade
     agreement and credits. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> proposed that headway in
     political matters and trade be parallel. When <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and
      <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> met at the funeral of Indian President Nehru in
     May, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> complained that the U.S. Government and
      <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> personally were impeding the development of
     U.S.-Soviet trade. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> later saw David Rockefeller on
     the eve of the U.S. financier' trip to Moscow and stated that various problems made
     a large increase in bilateral trade unlikely for some time. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> was convinced that the Soviets were unwilling to make political concessions
     for any trade benefits. (14, 33, 40)</p>
                <p> Johnson and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> exchanged confidential
     messages during 1964, which the Soviet leader called “our dialogue.”
     Differences ran deep over the German question, with feelings especially strong over two
     incidents in which American planes flew into Soviet-patrolled East German airspace and were
     shot down. However, self-congratulatory notes were struck about a mutual cutback in the
     production of plutonium and uranium-235 for military purposes and a joint study of the problem
     of desalting sea water. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> proposed a gradual
     reduction in the level of Soviet and U.S. armed forces in Europe, assuring that he would soon
     reduce by 15,000 the Soviet troop strength beyond the Soviet Union' borders in
     Europe. (1, 21, 27, 28, 36)</p>
                <p>The U.S. presidential campaign brought a pause to East-West negotiations in late summer 1964.
     The administration chose not to press for Senate action to ratify the U.S.-Soviet Consular
     Convention lest its consideration in a pre-election period trigger a controversy with
     Republican Party hardliners over Soviet-American relations. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> indicated in a telephone conversation with Johnson that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> supported his candidacy but that the Soviets would not
     interfere in the campaign; <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> had urged the latter
     course in an earlier conversation with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. (37,
     39, 43, 45)</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">
                    <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>' Downfall and First Contacts With
     His Successors</p>
                <p> Johnson was heading for a decisive victory at the polls when <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> unexpectedly left the political scene. U.S. analysts dismissed the
     official explanation of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
     resignation for—reasons of health and old age—emphasizing instead
     internal Soviet discontent with his erratic leadership style and his restructuring of the
      <gloss target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss> apparatus, opposition to his advocacy of giving consumer
     goods priority over military programs, and distress at Moscow' loss of leadership of
     the world Communist movement. (51–54, 57, 59) <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
     met with Johnson to assure him that peaceful coexistence and relaxation of tensions were still
     the basic aims of Soviet foreign policy. Ambassador at Large <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Llewellyn Thompson</persName>, however, briefed the Congressional leadership to the effect
     that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>' successors would likely
     follow a more orthodox Communist line. U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Foy Kohler</persName> agreed that the new regime would not be as
     enthusiastic as <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>' in seeking areas
     of common interest with the United States. He anticipated a Soviet turn to a more formal style
     of diplomacy, with an end to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'
     impromptu remarks on policy issues. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>, however,
     believed that Moscow would be more careful to avoid moves that could spark direct military
     clashes between the two superpowers. (55, 56, 61, 65) <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>, regardless of his forebodings, told Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> that a serious attempt should be made to develop trade relations with the
     Soviet Union. Soviet Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Andrei Gromyko</persName>
     personally asked <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> if the United States was willing to
     consider a trade agreement. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> again stressed the
     political and technical roadblocks. (66, 75)</p>
                <p>In his State of the Union address in January 1965, President Johnson expressed the hope that
     the new Soviet leaders would visit the United States. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> assured <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that the President
     meant every word of it, and Johnson confirmed it in a message to the Soviet Government. (82,
     85) <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> that he was sure that the Soviet Government would favor a Johnson trip to
     the Soviet Union. A February 1 message from the Soviet leadership invited the President to the
     Soviet Union “on a State visit” in return for <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>' to the United States in 1959. (87, 90)</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Vietnam and the Deterioration of Relations</p>
                <p>The Soviet line stiffened after Johnson ordered air strikes against Hanoi, which <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was then visiting, in reprisal for a Communist military
     attack in South Vietnam. A Soviet oral message stressed the “obvious
     contradiction” between the U.S desire for a summit and the action taken in Vietnam.
     On February 9 and March 4, the U.S. Embassy in Moscow was attacked by mobs that were clearly
     acting under official guidance to protest the American bombings in North Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> openly castigated the American
     “aggressors” in Vietnam as barbarians and bandits. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> that
     U.S. actions were at odds with the administration' statements of intent to improve
     relations with the Soviet Union and were undermining the very foundation of those relations,
     peaceful coexistence. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> warned that the Soviet
     Union would help to defend North Vietnam. (91, 92, 99, 100, 104, 105)</p>
                <p>U.S. analysts identified Sino-Soviet rivalry inside the world Communist movement as the
     catalyst to Moscow' tougher stance. The State Department' Policy Planning
     Council argued in a February 1965 memorandum that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>' successors were bent on competing with China for the
     loyalty of militant Communist parties and were ready to sacrifice U.S.-Soviet
     détente if necessary. Thus, it was asserted, the Soviet Union had abandoned
      <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>' policy of disengagement from
     Indochina. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> opined in April that the
     Kremlin had decided several months earlier that its struggle with China forced it to play a
     more active role in Southeast Asia even if it caused relations with the United States to
     deteriorate. (96, 105, 106, 110)</p>
                <p>Whatever the weight of the China factor in Soviet decision-making, Moscow stood by Hanoi and
     indicated its disinclination to do business with the United States. Ambassador at <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Large W. Averell Harriman</persName> reported from Moscow in July that,
     during a 3-hour conversation, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was
     “completely negative” and “at times insulting.”
      <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> that progress in U.S.-Soviet relations was possible only if the President
     could “extract himself from Vietnam.” <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> reported in August 1965 that his Embassy' activities since
     February were best described as a “holding action” designed to minimize
     long-term damage, inasmuch as the Soviet Government had applied a
     “freeze” to U.S.-Soviet relations as a result of the war. The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> concluded in November that the Soviets “will probably
     maintain the current'freeze' in relations with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, as long as their new line in Vietnam seems to be paying dividends within the
     Communist world.” State Department analysts judged the hardening of the
     Soviets' demeanor “more as a tactic than a fundamental reorientation of
     policy.” (118, 119, 121, 134, 139)</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">A “Controlled” Freeze</p>
                <p>The year 1966 saw an extension of the Soviet freeze and continued public vilification of the
     United States by the Soviets over U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Yet it was a
     “controlled” freeze, observed U.S. Embassy officials in Moscow, in which
     the Soviets were prepared to make exceptions for initiatives they considered overwhelmingly in
     their national interest. On issues in which there was a convergence of national interests, some
     headway was made. The two countries signed a new Cultural Exchanges Agreement and the long
     pending Civil Air Agreement–“minor matters” in <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>' words–and by late 1966 had made
     modest progress in discussions of nuclear non-proliferation and significant strides in
     negotiating the Outer Space Treaty. The Soviets pursued the latter in spite of Vietnam,
     contended <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>, because they could not afford an arms
     race with the United States in space. The Outer Space Treaty was signed on January 27, 1967.
     (154, 164, 172, 173, 186, 189)</p>
                <p>In January 1967 <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> replaced <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> as Ambassador to the Soviet Union under express
     instructions, the President told <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, to improve
     relations and initiate discussions of a possible understanding to curb the strategic arms race.
     Walt Rostow, <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName>' successor as national
     security adviser, suggested to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that such a curb
     might encourage other nations to join in a non-proliferation agreement. During the same month,
     the President mounted a campaign to win Senate ratification of the languishing Consular
     Convention, which succeeded in March. When asked by <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> what lay behind the campaign, Rostow responded that progress in the
     non-proliferation discussions had sparked a growing sense that it was a propitious time to
     “create a good atmosphere” in U.S.-Soviet relations. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> for his part told <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> that he also wanted a relaxation of tensions and informed the President
     that he was willing to discuss strategic nuclear weapons. (192, 193, 197, 199, 203, 207)
      <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> warned <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>, however, that the question foremost on everyone' mind in
     Moscow remained Vietnam, and that U.S. peace moves were seen as merely a screen to cover U.S.
     escalation of the war. A <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> estimate issued in May advised
     that the Soviets had probably concluded that they had no alternative for the time being but to
     help Hanoi carry on the war. (211, 213)</p>
                <p>Soviet officials periodically bristled at the U.S. practice of welcoming Soviet defectors. In
     1966 <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had protested to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> that the United States was quick to get hold of Soviet
     defectors overseas and fly them to America. A furor arose in March 1967 when the late Soviet
     dictator Joseph Stalin' daughter, Svetlana Alliluyeva, walked into the U.S. Embassy
     in New Delhi and requested political asylum. After she was granted a visitor' visa
     to enter America, the Soviet Government complained that U.S. behavior was hostile and she was
     being incited to make anti-Soviet statements. Moscow later charged that the planned release of
     a book by <persName corresp="#p_AS1">Alliluyeva</persName> on the eve of the 50th anniversary
     of the Bolshevik Revolution was proof that the United States was exploiting her for propaganda
     purposes. In part to avoid unnecessary complications in U.S.-Soviet relations, the State
     Department decided in December 1967 to adopt the policy that Moscow should be notified of
     Soviet defectors to the United States and that arrangements would be made for a
     “confrontation” of the defectors with Soviet representatives if the
     Soviet Government requested. (156, 208, 210, 216, 240, 243, 259)</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Glassboro Summit</p>
                <p>Both sides wished to project an image of reasonableness after the latest military clash
     between their allies in the Middle East, the Six-Day War, which erupted in early June 1967.
     Johnson and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> conferred later that month in a
     hastily arranged summit meeting at Glassboro, New Jersey, in connection with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>' attendance at a special session of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly devoted to the Middle East situation.
     Johnson' advisers did not expect much in the way of substance to come out of the
     meeting but maintained that it would at least avoid all the negative consequences of not
     meeting and would give each man an opportunity to get a measure of the other. (221–223)
     Although Johnson found <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> friendly, even
     “jolly,” the talks were inconclusive. “It was just largely
     conversation–pleasant, no vitriolic stuff,” Johnson told former President
      <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D. Eisenhower</persName>. On the Middle East, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> insisted on the immediate and full withdrawal of Israeli
     troops and spurned Johnson' proposal for a full disclosure of arms shipments to the
     region and an agreement not to ship arms. Johnson pressed <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> on cutting military budgets and starting arms control talks, but <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> doubted much could be accomplished while the Middle East
     and Vietnam were in turmoil, and thus he wanted those issues addressed first. On Vietnam
      <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> assured Johnson that if he halted the bombing
     the North Vietnamese would go immediately to the conference table, but Johnson questioned
     whether the North Vietnamese might escalate the ground war if the bombing stopped. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> remained silent on Johnson' request that Cuban
     leader Fidel Castro be persuaded to stop encouraging guerrilla operations in Latin America, a
     matter Johnson viewed as “extremely important.” (229–235, 237, 238)</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Relations on “Dead Center”</p>
                <p>In the months following the Glassboro meeting, U.S. and Soviet officials continued to
     exchange views on a variety of multilateral and bilateral issues, from the Middle East and
     Vietnam to arms control and new embassy sites, but relations remained essentially on dead
     center. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> that there was really no fixed policy in Moscow, that everything was
     discussed on an ad hoc basis, but that the posture was to handle U.S. relations in
     “low key” as long as the war in Vietnam lasted. At year's end
      <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> characterized his first year back in Moscow as
     a holding operation: “no hits, no runs, and I hope no errors.” U.S.
     officials in both Washington and Moscow ascribed the impasse not only to Vietnam but also to
     the cautious, suspicious, ideology-driven character of the Soviet leadership. As 1968 began the
     two countries continued to maintain discreet contacts on urgent issues like the
     Non-Proliferation Treaty, but Soviet accommodation with the United States was expected to be
     incremental at best, with only slight prospects for a strategic arms control agreement. (245,
     247, 258–261, 265)</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Strategic Arms Control and the Abortive Summit</p>
                <p> Johnson still wanted a direct encounter with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
     to moderate the nuclear arms race. In January 1968 <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
     instructed <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> to tell <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> that Johnson believed that it was in their mutual interest to begin
     official talks on limiting nuclear arms in order to resolve the problem at the earliest
     practicable moment. In June 1968 <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> finally agreed
     to hold talks on limiting and reducing both offensive strategic nuclear weapons and
     anti-ballistic missile defense systems. The two leaders issued statements to that effect on
     July 1, the day the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was signed. That same
     day <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> conferred to lay the groundwork for a Johnson-<persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> meeting in Geneva or Leningrad in July or August. A mid-July <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> analysis, however, concluded that this and other signs of change
     in Soviet policy did not presage very far-reaching effects for Soviet-American relations. (263,
     271, 277, 278, 281)</p>
                <p> Johnson was clearly unaware of the gravity of the situation concerning Czechoslovakia, where
     the reform Communist regime of Alexander Dubcek was under increasing pressure from Warsaw Pact
     allies to tighten its control over the reform elements. At a late July White House meeting,
     Defense Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM1">Clark Clifford</persName> warned of possible
     Soviet military intervention and advised Johnson against rushing to parley with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. Nevertheless, plans for both a summit and arms control
     talks moved ahead. On August 19 the Soviet leaders invited Johnson to visit Leningrad in early
     October to discuss “questions of mutual interest,” and in a message to
     the President the next day <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> proposed that special
     delegations begin strategic arms control talks in Geneva on September 30. The White House
     decided to announce the summit on August 21 and to indicate that the two leaders would consult
     not only on strategic arms but also on Vietnam, the Middle East, implementation of the
     Non-Proliferation Treaty, and a variety of bilateral matters. On August 20, however, Warsaw
     Pact forces invaded Czechoslovakia, and the announcement was postponed. The United States
     protested the action at the United Nations, and U.S. officials in Moscow were advised to keep
     all contacts with Soviet authorities to a minimum. (282, 286, 288, 289)</p>
                <p>Czechoslovakia notwithstanding, Johnson was reluctant to drop the idea of a Soviet summit. In
     September he instructed both <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> and Rostow to
     sound out <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> about initiating missile talks at the
     “highest level.” The Soviet Government responded positively to the idea
     of a summit, which would include discussion of Vietnam and the Middle East, as well as
     strategic arms. While the two sides carried on an intensive exchange of views on issues to be
     discussed, some doubts were expressed in Washington. Rostow warned that proper atmospherics had
     to include the Kremlin setting a date for the withdrawal of its troops from Czechoslovakia.
     Deputy Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs and Sovietologist <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Charles E. Bohlen</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
     that a summit would be widely regarded as condoning the Soviet action in Czechoslovakia and
     would undercut U.S. attempts to strengthen <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. (292, 294,
     296, 297, 311)</p>
                <p>Planning for a summit was complicated in early November by Republican <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard Nixon</persName>' election as President, but Rostow
     reported in mid-November, following a discussion with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, that Moscow was “clearly ready to go” if Johnson
     could work it out. Their reasons, Rostow told the President, were “similar to our
     own"—keep the momentum on missiles going into the next administration and create a
     good backdrop for moving ahead with the Non-Proliferation Treaty. At a late November White
     House meeting, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CCM1">Clifford</persName> advised Johnson to proceed with the summit despite the election results,
     lest momentum be lost. “It could be a year before a <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> team is ready to do this,” <persName corresp="#p_CCM1">Clifford</persName> stated. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> was informed of the
     administration' intentions. In Moscow a skeptical <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> met with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to discuss the
     summit, which the United States envisioned convening in Geneva on December 16 and 17, but no
     firm response was forthcoming from the Kremlin. By December 11, with less than 6 weeks left in
     the administration, the White House finally cooled to the idea, guessing that the Soviet
     leaders had too. Moreover, by then, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> had already
     made known to Moscow that he “seriously objected” to the idea. And a week
     later Henry Kissinger, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>' designee as
     national security adviser, told a Soviet Embassy official in Washington that the only purpose
     of a summit meeting before January 20 would be “propaganda to embarrass the new
     Administration.” The <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration was
     very interested in serious talks on strategic missiles and other issues, Kissinger assured the
     official, and wanted to achieve “lasting settlements.” By agreeing to
     such a summit, he maintained, the Soviet Government would fail a crucial test of its intentions
     to improve relations with the United States. (318, 322, 324, 326, 327, 330, 334, 335)</p>

                <p>The Foreign Relations of the United States series presents the official documentary
     historical record of major foreign policy decisions and significant diplomatic activity of the
     United States Government. The series documents the facts and events that contributed to the
     formulation of policies and includes evidence of supporting and alternative views to the policy
     positions ultimately adopted.</p>
                <p>The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the
     preparation of the Foreign Relations series. The staff of the Office of the Historian, Bureau
     of Public Affairs, plans, researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. This
     documentary editing proceeds in full accord with the generally accepted standards of historical
     scholarship. Official regulations codifying specific standards for the selection and editing of
     documents for the series were first promulgated by Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg on March
     26, 1925. These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by Public Law
     102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993, which was signed
     by President George Bush on October 28, 1991. Section 198 of P.L. 102–138 added a new Title IV
     to the Department of State's Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC 4351, et
     seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the Foreign Relations series be a thorough, accurate, and reliable
     record of major United States foreign policy decisions and significant United States diplomatic
     activity. The volumes of the series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive
     documentation of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government.
     The statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the Foreign
     Relations series is guided by the principles of historical objectivity and accuracy; records
     should not be altered or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a
     deletion has been made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major importance
     in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of concealing a defect
     in policy. The statute also requires that the Foreign Relations series be published not more
     than 30 years after the events recorded. The editors are convinced that this volume, which was
     compiled in 1993–1998, meets all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly standards of selection
     and editing.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Structure and Scope of the Foreign Relations Series</p>
                <p>This volume is part of a subseries of volumes of the Foreign Relations series that documents
     the most important issues in the foreign policy of the 5 years (1964–1968) of the
     administration of <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>. The subseries
     presents in 34 volumes a documentary record of major <pb n="IV" xml:id="pg_IV" facs="0004"/>foreign policy decisions and actions of President Johnson's administration. This
     volume documents U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union. Documentation on the Soviet invasion of
     Czechoslovakia in August 1968 is printed in <ref target="frus1964-68v17">Foreign Relations,
      1964–1968, volume XVII</ref>.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Principles of Document Selection for the Foreign Relations Series</p>
                <p>In preparing each volume of the Foreign Relations series, the editors are guided by some
     general principles for the selection of documents. Each editor, in consultation with the
     General Editor and other senior editors, determines the particular issues and topics to be
     documented either in detail, in brief, or in summary.</p>
                <p>The following general selection criteria are used in preparing volumes in the Foreign
     Relations series. Individual compiler-editors vary these criteria in accordance with the
     particular issues and the available documentation. The editors also apply these selection
     criteria in accordance with their own interpretation of the generally accepted standards of
     scholarship. In selecting documentation for publication, the editors gave priority to
     unpublished classified records, rather than previously published records (which are accounted
     for in appropriate bibliographical notes).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="strong">Selection Criteria (in general order of priority):</hi>

                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Sources for the Foreign Relations Series</p>
                <p>The Foreign Relations statute requires that the published record in the Foreign Relations
     series include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation on major U.S. foreign
     policy decisions and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires that government
     agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government engaged in foreign policy
     formulation, execution, or support cooperate with the Department of State Historian by
     providing full and complete access to records pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions
     and by providing copies of selected records. Many of the sources consulted in the preparation
     of this volume have been declassified and are available for review at the National Archives and
     Records Administration. The declassification review and opening for public review of all
     Department of State records no later than 30 years after the events is mandated by the Foreign
     Relations statute. The Department of State and other record sources used in the volume are
     described in detail in the section on Sources below.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Focus of Research and Principles of Selection for Foreign Relations,
     1964–1968, Volume XIV</p>
                <p>The editors of the volume sought to include documentation illuminating the foreign
     policymaking process of the U.S. Government, with <pb n="VI" xml:id="pg_VI" facs="0006"/>emphasis on the highest level at which policy on a particular subject was determined. The
     documents include memoranda and records of discussions that set forth policy issues and show
     decisions or actions taken. The emphasis is on the development of U.S. policy and on major
     aspects and repercussions of its execution rather than on the details of policy execution.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon Johnson</persName> made the major foreign policy decisions
     during his presidency, and the editors sought to document his role as far as possible. Although
     the foreign policy record of the Johnson administration is voluminous, many internal
     discussions between Johnson and his advisers were not recorded. The record of
     Johnson's involvement as well as that of Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> in the policy process often had to be pieced together from a
     variety of sources.</p>
                <p>The volume focuses on the issues that primarily engaged high-level U.S. policymakers. Major
     topics include: (1) Contacts between President Johnson and Soviet leaders, including the
     Glassboro Summit in 1967; (2) Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s ouster in 1964 and its consequences for U.S.-Soviet
     relations; (3) assessments of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
     successors; (4) the impact of the Vietnam war on U.S.-Soviet relations; (5) discussions of
     bilateral issues, including arms control, trade, cultural exchanges, the Civil Air Agreement,
     the Consular Convention, the defection of Stalin's daughter, and new embassy sites;
     and (6) the Johnson administration's efforts during 1968 to initiate strategic arms
     control talks and arrange a summit meeting.</p>
                <p>The editors included a selection of intelligence estimates and analyses seen by high-level
     policymakers, especially those that were sent to President Johnson.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time or, in the case of
     conferences, in the order of individual meetings. Memoranda of conversation are placed
     according to the time and date of the conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was
     drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the Foreign Relations series follows Office
     style guidelines, supplemented by guidance from the General Editor and the chief technical
     editor. The source text is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other
     notations, which are described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed according to
     accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents in the limitations of modern
     typography. A heading has been supplied by the editors for each document included in the
     volume. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation are retained as found in the source text,
     except that obvious typographical errors are <pb n="VII" xml:id="pg_VII" facs="0007"/>silently
     corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the source text are corrected by bracketed
     insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an addition in roman type. Words or phrases
     underlined in the source text are printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are
     preserved as found in the source text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the front
     matter of each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an unrelated
     subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after declassification review (in italic
     type). The amount of material not declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines
     or pages of source text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for declassification
     purposes have been accounted for and are listed by headings, source notes, and number of pages
     not declassified in their chronological place. The amount of material omitted from this volume
     because it was unrelated to the subject of the volume, however, has not been delineated. All
     brackets that appear in the source text are so identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document's source, original
     classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also provides the background
     of important documents and policies and indicates whether the President or his major policy
     advisers read the document. Every effort has been made to determine if a document has been
     previously published, and, if so, this information has been included in the source
     footnote.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not printed in the
     volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources, provide references to
     important related documents printed in other volumes, describe key events, and provide
     summaries of and citations to public statements that supplement and elucidate the printed
     documents. Information derived from memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when
     appropriate to supplement or explicate the official record.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under the Foreign
     Relations statute, reviews records, advises, and makes recommendations concerning the Foreign
     Relations series. The Advisory Committee monitors the overall compilation and editorial process
     of the series and advises on all aspects of the preparation and declassification of the series.
     Although the Advisory Committee does not attempt to review the contents of individual volumes
     in the series, it does monitor the overall process and makes recommendations on particular
     problems that come to its attention.</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee has not reviewed this volume.</p>
                <pb n="VIII" xml:id="pg_VIII" facs="0008"/>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The final declassification review of this volume, which began in 1998 and was completed in
     1999, resulted in the decision to withhold about .09 percent of the documentation selected. No
     documents were denied in full. The Information Response Branch of the Office of IRM Programs
     and Services, Bureau of Administration, Department of State, conducted the declassification
     review of the documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with
     the standards set forth in Executive Order 12958 on Classified National Security Information
     and applicable laws. Under Executive Order 12958, specific information may be exempt from
     automatic declassification after 25 years if its release could be expected to:</p>
                <p>1) reveal the identity of a confidential human source, or reveal information about the
     application of an intelligence source or method, or reveal the identity of a human intelligence
     source when the unauthorized disclosure of that source would clearly and demonstrably damage
     the national security interests of the United States;</p>
                <p>2) reveal information that would assist in the development or use of weapons of mass
     destruction;</p>
                <p>3) reveal information that would impair U.S. cryptologic systems or activities;</p>
                <p>4) reveal information that would impair the application of state of the art technology within
     the U.S. weapon system;</p>
                <p>5) reveal actual U.S. military war plans that remain in effect;</p>
                <p>6) reveal information that would seriously and demonstrably impair relations between the
     United States and a foreign government, or seriously and demonstrably undermine ongoing
     diplomatic activities of the United States;</p>
                <p>7) reveal information that would clearly and demonstrably impair the current ability of U.S.
     Government officials to protect the President, Vice President, and other officials for whom
     protection services, in the interest of national security, are authorized;</p>
                <p>8) reveal information that would seriously and demonstrably impair current national security
     emergency preparedness plans; or</p>
                <p>9) violate a statute, treaty, or international agreement.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information, subject only to
     the current requirements of national security as embodied in law and regulation.
     Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the appropriate geographic and functional
     bureaus in the Department of State, other concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the
     appropriate foreign governments regarding specific documents of those governments.</p>

                <head>Sources for the Foreign Relations Series</head>
                <p>The Foreign Relations statute requires that the published record in the Foreign Relations
     series include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation on major U.S. foreign
     policy decisions and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires that government
     agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government engaged in foreign policy
     formulation, execution, or support cooperate with the Department of State Historian by
     providing full and complete access to records pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions
     and by providing copies of selected records. Many of the sources consulted in the preparation
     of this volume have been declassified and are available for review at the National Archives and
     Records Administration. The declassification review and opening for public review of all
     Department of State records no later than 30 years after the events is mandated by the Foreign
     Relations statute. The Department of State and other record sources used in the volume are
     described in detail in the section on Sources below.</p>

                <p>Sources</p>
                <p>The editors of the Foreign Relations series have complete access to all the retired records
     and papers of the Department of State: the central files of the Department; the special
     decentralized files (“lot files”) of the Department at the bureau,
     office, and division levels; the files of the Department's Executive Secretariat,
     which contain the records of international conferences and high-level official visits,
     correspondence with foreign leaders by the President and Secretary of State, and memoranda of
     conversations between the President and Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the files
     of overseas diplomatic posts.</p>
                <p>The editors of the Foreign Relations series also have full access to the papers of President
     Johnson and other White House foreign policy records. Presidential papers maintained and
     preserved at the Presidential libraries include some of the most significant foreign
     affairs-related documentation from the Department of State and other Federal agencies including
     the National Security Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and
     the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                <p>In preparing this volume, the editors made extensive use of Presidential papers and other
     White House records at the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName> Library.
     Numerous White House memoranda, including memoranda to the President, testify to President
     Johnson's concern with issues relating to the Soviet Union. The bulk of the foreign
     policy records at the Johnson Library concerning the Soviet Union are in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> Country File and other component parts of the National Security
     File. Documentation on U.S. efforts during the last six months of 1968 to arrange a summit
     meeting and initiate arms control talks is found primarily in <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt
      Rostow</persName>'s files in the National Security File, particularly his files on
     “Chlodnick,” “Trip to Soviet Union,” and
      “<persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>.”</p>
                <p>The Department of State arranged for access to the many audiotapes of President
     Johnson's telephone conversations that are held at the Johnson Library. These
     audiotapes include substantial numbers of telephone conversations between President Johnson and
     Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, the President's Special Assistant for
     National Security Affairs McGeorge Bundy, and key members of Congress. The editors of this
     volume selected for publication several audiotapes of President Johnson's telephone
     conversations dealing with the Soviet Union. Transcripts were then prepared. Although the
     transcripts give the substance of the conversations, readers are urged to consult the
     recordings for a full appreciation of those dimensions that cannot be captured fully in a
     transcription, such as the speakers' inflections and emphases that may convey
     nuances of meaning.</p>
                <p>Second in importance only to the White House records at the Johnson Library were the records
     of the Department of State. The Department's central files contain the cable traffic
     recording U.S. diplomatic <pb n="XVI" xml:id="pg_XVI" facs="0016"/>relations with the Soviet
     Union, memoranda of diplomatic conversations, and memoranda proposing action or providing
     information. Some important documents are found only in the Department's lot files.
     The files of <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Foy D. Kohler</persName> contain memoranda of his
     conversations with Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> during
     1967, when <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> was Deputy Under Secretary for
     Political Affairs. The Conference Files maintained by the Executive Secretariat contain
     briefing materials as well as records of conversations. Documentation on initiatives that were
     not approved is often found only in desk or bureau files.</p>
                <p>The Central Intelligence Agency provides access to Department of State historians to
     high-level intelligence documents from those records in the custody of that Agency and at the
     Presidential libraries. This access is arranged and facilitated by the History Staff of the
     Center for the Study of Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, pursuant to a May 1992
     memorandum of understanding. Department of State and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
     historians continue to work out the procedural and scholarly aspects of identifying the key
     portions of the intelligence record.</p>
                <p>This volume includes a number of intelligence records. Among the intelligence records
     reviewed for the volume were files of the Directors of Central Intelligence, particularly
      <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">John A. McCone</persName>'s, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> intelligence reports in White House files and in files of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s Directorate of Intelligence, and Historical Files of the Department
     of State's Bureau of Intelligence and Research.</p>
                <p>Almost all of this documentation has been made available for use in the Foreign Relations
     series thanks to the consent of the agencies mentioned, the assistance of their staffs, and
     especially the cooperation and support of the National Archives and Records Administration.</p>
                <p>The following list identifies the particular files and collections used in the preparation of
     this volume. Many of the records are already available for public review at the National
     Archives. The declassification review of other records is going forward in accordance with the
     provisions of Executive Order 12958, under which all records over 25 years old, except file
     series exemptions requested by agencies and approved by the President, should be reviewed for
     declassification by 2002.</p>

                        <p>In a December 31, 1963, letter sent to President Johnson and heads of state or government
       throughout the world, Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> proposed an
       international agreement to settle territorial disputes and border issues by peaceful means.
       For text of the 5,000-word letter, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, February 3, 1964, pages
       158–163, or Documents on Disarmament, 1963, pages 654–665.</p>
                        <p>On January 2, 1964, upon learning of the letter from Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, the President telephoned his Special Assistant for
       National Security Affairs, McGeorge Bundy, and proposed that he “get <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and the five ablest men in the State Department and go up
       to Camp David and lock the gate this weekend and try to find some imaginative proposal or
       some initiative that we can take besides just reacting to actions and just letting <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> wire everybody twenty-five pages every two days and
       us just sit back and dodge.” Johnson continued, “I'm tired,
       by God, [of] him being the man who wants peace in the world and I'm the guy who
       wants war.” (Johnson Library, Recordings and Transcripts, Recording of a Telephone
       Conversation between the President and <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName>, January
       2, 3 p.m., Tape 6401.02, PNO 10) A transcript of the conversation is printed in Michael
       Beschloss, Taking Charge, pages 144–145. The President telephoned Secretary of Defense
        <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> a few minutes later and raised the same
       issue. “I don't like every time I wake up in the morning and see where
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> sent me another communication for peace.
       Makes me appear like a warmonger.” Johnson asked <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> “to be thinking of anything you can that will give substance
       to our peace offensive.” (Johnson Library, Recordings and Transcripts, Recording
       of a Telephone Conversation between the President and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, 3:20 p.m., January 2, Tape 6401.02, PNO 12)</p>
                        <p>On January 3 the President discussed a proposed statement in response to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s letter with <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Ambassador at Large <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>,
       but the statement was not issued. (Ibid., Recordings of Telephone Conversations with
        <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, 11:15 a.m. and 11:25 a.m., January 3, Tape 6401.02, PNOs 16 and 17)
       Johnson responded to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in a January 18 letter
       in which he proposed “even broader” guidelines for settling territorial
       disputes and called on the Soviet leader to join him in new disarmament proposals to the
       Geneva conference. For text, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, February 3, 1964, <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0030"/>pages 157–158, or <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the

                        <p>Messrs. Linen, Cook, Harper and Clurman called to discuss the trip they and other
       industrialists recently made to Western Europe and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.
       They reported they had been given VIP treatment in Moscow, and the Soviet part of their trip
       consisted primarily in seeing <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>—for seven hours at one session. The Secretary commented the
       Soviets probably considered them to be the “ruling circles” of the
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked the group if they had seen any indications of the current Soviet
       economic difficulties, adding that we had underestimated these difficulties. The extent of
       the problem can be seen by Soviet willingness to spend one billion dollars worth of their
       gold reserve of two and a half billion to buy wheat. The Secretary added that when he had
       seen <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in Moscow in August he noted <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had been preoccupied, and thought at the time it was
       because of the Chinese problem. In retrospect, it seems it may well have been over the Soviet
       economy.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="pg_3" facs="0031"/>
                        <p>Mr. Harper replied that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had tried hard to
       convince the group the Soviets wanted trade, and had urged them to sell him fertilizer
       plants.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Linen added that at a reception <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had
       talked to Mr. Peterson of the Bank of America for twenty minutes or so on the Soviet desire
       for credits.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary interjected that we have been trying to hold the line on credits, not just to
       the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> but generally, though the British have been a
       problem. Mr. Linen commented that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> played on
       the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-British difference.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has said it will take a hard look
       at trade with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and the Administration is also
       studying this. Not too much can be expected, however, since there is not too much the Soviets
       have to trade.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Harper said the Soviets told them they could trade us anything we wanted, and seemed
       very sensitive to the line that they had nothing to trade.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cook asked the Secretary to confirm his estimate of two and a half billion dollars of
       gold reserves. The Secretary said this was our firm estimate, and added that given the Soviet
       program and their reserves, there is a question of how good a credit risk they are. This is
       more of a problem than we had supposed. We had thought that the wheat sales were a one-shot
       operation, but with what we have seen of the virgin lands, and the dust bowl they are turning
       into, the less short-term the wheat shortage seems.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cook said he had come to a similar conclusion. The Soviets do not have enough land with
       adequate rainfall, they lack herbicides and pesticides as well as fertilizer, and have no
       seed strains suitable for using with heavy applications of fertilizer. It seemed likely,
       therefore, the Soviets would be in the wheat market for three or four years.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Harper asked how the Soviets would pay for the wheat.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary suggested they might exchange what they have, arms for example, for a
       commodity such as Cuban sugar or cotton that they could sell on the market.</p>
                        <p>In reply to a question as to whether it was a better tactic to freeze out the Soviets, or
       to let them see the benefits of the capitalist world, the Secretary commented that a new
       situation has arisen since 1955 by virtue of our ability for mutual nuclear destruction.
       Under modern nuclear conditions, he did not worry that fertilizer plants would increase
       Soviet military strength, as it might have in the days of long, conventional wars. He added
       that we do not want to get into an aid program with the Soviets via credit. We would rather
       give our aid to the Free World. In the case of wheat, however, we have it coming out of our
       ears, and we are short of gold. If the Soviets spend gold for wheat, this <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0032"/> could be very important. The Secretary recalled he had told
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in August<note n="2" xml:id="d2fn2">For a
        summary of <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s conversation with

       that we would like to trade with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, but as traders.
       We would like to sell 1,000 tractors, not just one, for the Soviets to copy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Harper said they had tried to push Patolichev (Minister of Foreign Trade) on patents.
       Patolichev had not responded, but a Chamber of Commerce man had insisted that no Americans
       had applied for patents.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if Alcoa had a plant in Jamaica, and suggested to Mr. Harper that his
       office there look into the Jamaica situation. The Soviets have offered to underwrite a 250
       million dollar five-year development program. Alcoa could be of assistance to us on this.</p>
                        <p>As the group left, the Secretary summarized by saying that there would be trade, not aid,
       with the Soviet Union, but suggested they did not count on too much. There are many problems,
       such as Soviet ability to pay, patents, and lend lease.</p>

       did consider it useful to review entire range of pending bilateral issues in way designed to
       focus his attention on bilateral relations as whole and to leave impression of
       interrelationship between Civil Air Agreement, leased line, satellite communications,
       Consular Convention and Exchange Agreement. However, I am somewhat alarmed by lengths to
       which this thought is carried in introductory paragraph of reftel, which would appear to make
       settlement any of these dependent on settlement <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0033"/>of all.
       We do not consider such linkage either feasible or in US interest. These several questions
       involve different agencies of Soviet system and different points of view, which, even if they
       really wanted to do so, Soviet Foreign Ministry or even Soviet leadership might have
       difficulty in overcoming or reconciling at any given time. Fact is that despite provision in
       Roosevelt-Litvinov agreement<note n="4" xml:id="d3fn4">For text of this agreement, November
        16, 1933, see ibid., The Soviet Union, 1933–1939, pp. 33–34.</note> calling for prompt
       negotiation consular convention we have managed to carry on consular functions for past 30
       years with degrees of success dependent more on general political atmosphere than on
       non-existence of conventions as such. Similarly, we have developed and carried on
       increasingly successful exchange program over past six years without any of other
       arrangements now under negotiation. All of these proposals are desirable and all are
       interrelated in the general context of bilateral relations and in the sense that each
       supports, or facilitates the carrying out of the other. However, flat linkage between them
       would reduce rate of progress to least common denominator (we're not even certain
       which this is, at present) and even risk set-back from present levels, notably in field
       exchanges. I trust this is not what Dept has in mind.</p>

       to assess the course, implications, and overall outlook of the Soviet economic scene over the
       next few years.</p>

                        <p>A. A number of serious long-run problems in the Soviet economy have recently reached an
       acute stage. Overall growth is lagging, various sectors of the economy are intensifying
       competition for scarce resources, agricultural production is falling far short of needs,
       large wheat purchases in 1963 have greatly aggravated the hard-currency deficit, and gold
       stocks are nearing a critically low level. This situation is due in part to chronic Soviet
       mismanagement, but mainly to the burdens imposed on the economy by a series of programs too
       ambitious for available resources. The demands of defense and space have greatly encumbered
       economic growth since 1958. Recently, industry has been adversely affected, as well as
       agriculture and the production of consumer goods. (Paras. 1–4)</p>
                        <p>B. Soviet leaders have now launched a new effort to cope with their most intractable
       economic problem—the stagnation of agriculture—through a large
       expansion of the chemical industry, especially for the production of fertilizer. They
       apparently expect to finance this program from the expansion they anticipate in the economy,
       from cutbacks in some nondefense programs, and from large and long-term Western credits. But
       we also think that the Soviets will make every effort to hold down defense and space
       expenditures so as to release scarce resources for investment in the civilian economy.
       (Paras. 6–8, 10, 18, 20)</p>
                        <p>C. While defense expenditures may decline, we think it more likely that they will continue
       to grow, though at a slower pace than in the recent past. In the short term, the Soviet
       leaders have the option of reducing force levels, but in the long term they must consider the
       advisability of curtailing or stretching out one or more programs for advanced weapons.
       (Para. 20)</p>
                        <p>D. The Soviets will make sustained efforts to expand trade with the West, and particularly
       to obtain large and long-term Western credits. This will help foster continued restraint in
       the tone of Soviet foreign policy, though not major concessions of substance. (Paras. 21,
       22)</p>
                        <p>E. Over the next few years, investment in agriculture and the chemical industry will
       greatly increase, partly as a result of the policies above outlined, partly from the natural
       growth of the total Soviet economy. However, chances of restoring previous high levels of
       industrial growth are slim, and the innate rigidities of Soviet planning and administration
       will continue to hamper the economy. Many of the chemical program's current
       targets will almost certainly not be met, agricultural production will fall far short of
       projected goals, and significant benefits to the consumer will be several years in the
       making. (Para. 25)</p>

                        <p>Your assumption that settlements of consular convention, exchange agreement, civil air
       agreement, and leased line issues are not absolutely interdependent is correct. I appreciate
       your cogent comments this important and elusive question.</p>
                        <p>However, we are convinced of necessity scheduling progress on these individual projects in
       such way as to maximize our leverage and pressure upon Soviets to satisfy our patently
       legitimate leased-line request and minimum position on consular access. It is precisely
       because of risk of set back from present levels in field of exchanges that we find Soviet
       commitment on consular access question essential prior to conclusion cultural negotiations.

       burden implementation exchanges agreement, in our judgment will result in seriously curtailed
       cultural exchange this year and sharp opposition to air agreement if we cannot provide
       evidence that arbitrary uncivilized Soviet action against American citizens is more unlikely
       in future.</p>
                        <p>Specifically wish to emphasize that formal conclusion consular convention is not
       necessarily what we have in mind, since this obviously depends on several non-substantive
       factors. But Soviet acceptance of at least our minimum access and notification position does
       inevitably affect our ability to conclude and implement satisfactorily broadest possible
       exchanges agreement and civil air agreement.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> came in today, at my invitation,
       to hear my reflections in response to the reflections which he had offered me on December
        31.<note n="2" xml:id="d6fn2">For a memorandum for the record of this conversation, see <ref target="frus1961-63v05#d390">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1961–1963, vol. V, Document 390</ref>. On January
        9 <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> also raised the question of a summit
        meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. The Soviet Ambassador
        expressed the opinion that such a meeting would be useful, but no conclusions were reached
        during the discussion. (Memorandum of conversation; National Archives and Records
        Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Presidential Correspondence: Lot 77 D
        163) On January 13 Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> transmitted his
        recommendations on a summit meeting in telegram 2162. (Department of State, S/S–I
        Limdis/Exdis Microfilm) <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> voiced his disapproval
        of a bilateral summit, but suggested the utilization of the “Pen Pal”
        channel in moving forward some of the interrelated bilateral questions.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador that I had thought about his reflections in the framework of the
       President's clearly expressed conviction that nothing was more important than to
       find ways of strengthening the peace and to find new openings for good agreements between the
       Soviet Union and the United States.</p>
                        <p>I then said that in thinking about the possibility of a meeting with the Chairman, I had
       found myself increasingly impressed by the very great political difficulties standing between
       the President and any trip outside the country. I said that the President's
       position was different from that of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
       in three ways:</p>
                        <p>1. There was now no Vice President, which meant that there was no one to whom the interim
       responsibilities of the President could be readily assigned during his absence from the
       country. As a result, there would be real difficulties in domestic terms for the President to
       leave the country on any but a very serious mission.</p>
                        <p>2. The President was deeply engaged in the process of trying to secure the passage of his
       legislative program, and particularly of the two great measures which President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had first put forward—the tax bill and the
       civil rights bill. The time available to get these bills <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0037"/>through was now very short, and President Johnson did not have what President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had had—an experienced Vice President to
       whom he could confide the responsibility for working with the Congress on these measures
       while he was out of the country. It would be very difficult for the President to maintain a
       sense of urgency and of pressure upon the Congress if he himself were to leave the country on
       any but the most urgent of meetings.</p>
                        <p>3. The President, on straight political grounds, thought it was of great importance for him
       to continue to maintain the continuity and stability of the Presidency by sticking right to
       his work here in the United States, and thus I thought he was in the process of making a rule
       that he simply would not leave the country at all in 1964. I explained that we had been
       confronted with this problem by an informal inquiry about a visit to Martinique, and I told
       the Ambassador that while, of course, the two questions were not directly related, I also
       thought that in the process of explaining this position to the French, we had necessarily
       been put in the position of making clear the difficulty the President would have in leaving
       the country at all this year.</p>
                        <p>Thus, I concluded, my own thought now was that we ought not to think in terms of a possible
       meeting in 1964, unless we should somehow be successful in finding some very large new
       forward step, at least comparable in magnitude to the nuclear test ban treaty. I did not know
       what such a step might be, but I thought it was entirely reasonable for both sides to
       continue the work to find such a new and major achievement.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador pressed me somewhat to know what kind of proposals would meet this standard,
       and I said I thought this was a very important matter and one which deserved reflection. I
       thought it was not just a matter for my reflection, but for his as well, and perhaps when we
       both had thought about that we might talk again. He was non-committal and tried more than
       once to indicate that it was for me to say what package would be big enough. He asked whether
       any of the new proposals which he saw that we were going to make in Geneva would be the
       appropriate size and shape to justify a meeting. I said this was a good question, and one
       which I could not answer without further reflection.</p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador that we were disappointed in the tone of his country's
       propaganda about the situation in Panama, and he replied that as far as he knew, his people
       were saying nothing more than the Panamanians were saying. I said I thought this was not the
       case and that he should not think propaganda of this kind was helpful to our relations.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador's invitation to put a price tag on a summit meeting is obvious,
       but I doubt if we need to do this for some little time, if <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0038"/>at all. Since I pressed the Ambassador to put up his own suggestions, I think
       we can easily wait for them to come again if we prefer.<note n="3" xml:id="d6fn3">In his
        memoir, In Confidence: Moscow's Ambassador to America's Six Cold War
        Presidents, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> recalls the meeting with
         <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> but says “later we learned that it
        was <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> who had more or less discouraged Johnson from

       wishes and regards and to acquaint him on informal confidential basis with Secy's
       current thinking re East-West negotiations (so that Spaak would not feel compelled to make
       uncoordinated initiatives or proposals re East-West negotiations that could create problems).
       Explained that while we have no illusions that basic Soviet objectives have changed, Secy
       wants Spaak to know our views because we greatly appreciate Spaak's leadership in
        <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> and elsewhere in trying to keep our allies alert to

                        <p>Following is summary of what I said to Spaak, at conclusion of which he asked his deep

       troubles and Soviets have great economic problems in their allocation of limited resources.
       Their gold and foreign reserves probably in neighborhood of $2 billion and they have been or
       will be obliged to spend perhaps almost $1 billion for grain. Demands of Soviet agriculture
       are great as are those for social advances (housing, consumer goods, etc.) whereas Soviet
       space and defense programs are very costly.</p>
                        <p>Insofar as overall picture concerned, Cuban missile crisis may have been more significant
       and sobering to Soviets than we ourselves believed at that time in causing the Soviets to
       think again about their past policy of rattling the threat of missile annihilation to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and our allies.</p>
                        <p>In past two years we have engaged in far ranging probing of Soviet position and have
       explored and tried to identify elements of common interest. We believe as a result there is
       better comprehension in Russia of our position and that the Soviets have been influenced in
       constructive direction by our views on certain issues. Appointment of Soviet Amb Dobrynin who
       knows and understands <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> has also probably contributed to
       greater Soviet understanding of our basic views and positions and our non-negotiable vital
       interests.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Discussions with Soviets.</p>
                        <p>A. Possibility of multi-lateral agreements with Soviets: These consist of such matters as
       (I) disarmament dealt with at Geneva where prospect of breakthrough in near future not great;
       (II) Non-aggression Pact, but here also unless Berlin were included or we derived substantial
       other benefits there would be little advantage for us. While it useful keep discussion of
       multi-lateral possibilities with Soviets going we do not believe possibility of new and
       far-reaching multi-lateral agreements of a formal nature too promising in reasonable
       future.</p>
                        <p>B. Bilateral Agreements with Soviets. In this area there are limited and modest
       possibilities: (I) Consular Convention; (II) Civil Air Agreement providing for flights
       between <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Soviet Union; (III) agreements on cultural
       exchange; (IV) possibly some modest and limited agreements looking to an expansion of
       peaceful trade but here also except for grain the field is limited because Soviets, who
       engage in barter trade, have so little to offer.</p>
                        <p>C. Third area of exploration with the Soviets involved subjects where our policy interests
       coincide but where formal international <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0040"/>agreements are
       not possible. In other words problems where both we and Soviets, each for his own reasons,
       desire to act along parallel lines. Where, in effect, there is de facto similarity of
       interests and policy although no formal agreement is possible.</p>
                        <p>(I) Non-dissemination of Nuclear Weapons. The Soviets, like ourselves, desire avoid nuclear
       weapons dissemination and seem want them limited to nations (<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, France and Soviet) who have such weapons
       today. They do not wish <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to give them to our other allies
       and Soviets apparently do not intend on their part to give them to ChiComs or satellites.
       However formal agreement probably not possible as among other things Soviets would probably
       insist we abandon <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> as conditions for non-dissemination
       agreement.</p>
                        <p>While Soviets oppose <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> they would probably do so in any
       event as the Soviets oppose anything that ties Germany closer to its principal <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies and strengthens Western unity. Actually, Soviet
       principal objective is Germany not have its finger alone on nuclear trigger and <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> should prevent this.</p>
                        <p>(II) Lowering Defense Budgets. Here also there seems little possibility of a
       “formal agreement” because it would be virtually impossible to reach
       meaningful agreement on what a defense budget includes and because basic factors involved in
       such budgets are different (i.e., we pay enlisted men minimum of $120 per month whereas
       Soviets pay only fraction thereof). In Soviet closed society true size of military budget can
       be concealed and recently when military budget went down budget for “other" types
       of research and development (probably including military) went up. However, defense budgets
       of Soviets and ourselves are leveling off and may undergo modest reduction in years ahead
       even though it would not seem possible to have a formal accord on this. We have told Soviets
       we would be willing to sit down and have technical people try to reach common understanding
       or definition of what elements of defense budget should be but Soviets have not taken us up
       on this. Nonetheless, we believe Soviets do have an interest, as do we, in leveling off and
       trying to reduce military spending. And we believe what we have said to them about this over
       the past two years has had an influence on them.</p>
                        <p>(III) Limited Measures that Could be Helpful in Certain Aspects of Arms Control. For
       example, agreement to destroy obsolescent bomber aircraft (B–47's and Badger)
       could be useful. For although these aircraft becoming obsolete in terms of total nuclear war
       they would still represent formidable weapon if they were given to other states (i.e., if
       given to Arabs it could present mortal danger for Israel and cause latter to act; if given to
       certain Asian nations (Indonesia) it could increase hostilities in that area, etc.). Soviets
       have asked us if we have other weapons in mind in addition to aircraft and we have expressed
       a willingness to examine other proposals but they have not followed up on this.</p>
                        <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0041"/>
                        <p>(IV) Nuclear-free Zones in Latin America and Africa. We feel this also offers de facto
       opportunities even if no formal agreement possible because (a) there are not nuclear weapons
       in these areas now; and (b) because these areas do not represent primary military or
       industrial targets. Although formal agreement perhaps impossible (Cuba might not agree unless
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was included in atom-free zone and Arabs might not because
       of fear Israel might get “the bomb,” etc.) we believe Soviets do not
       wish to see weapons extended into these areas any more than we do and therefore an area of
       tacit even if not formal agreement may be possible.</p>
                        <p>(V) We also believe we should continue to probe Soviets and urge them be cautious in such
       areas as Laos, Vietnam and Cuba where dangers could escalate. Re Laos and Cuba Soviets have
       not been entirely unresponsive but insofar as Vietnam concerned we have had little comfort or
       sympathy.</p>
                        <p>To summarize some constructive progress has been and may continue to be made in some of
       these problems by mutuality of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet interest without
       formal agreements and therefore fact that there are no formal agreements being negotiated
       does not mean we are frozen in a rigid position. We will continue to probe and believe that
       this method more designed to achieve positive results in certain areas than by trying to
       insist on formal agreements. (End summary.)</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Secretary Freeman said that the problem we were facing was the long-term one. The Russians
       will not pay a shipping subsidy to get U.S. wheat. However, they do want more U.S. wheat in
       the future. Our problem is to decide what we should do. Uncertainty about the use of U.S.
       ships is the basic problem. Are we to continue to insist that 50% of the U.S. wheat be
       shipped in U.S. bottoms?</p>
                        <p>Secretary Hodges agreed that the basic problem was whether or not we did away with the
       requirement that 50% of the ships used to move U.S. wheat to the Soviet Union be U.S.
       bottoms.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Freeman said the Russians would be interested in buying 1,500,000 tons of wheat
       next spring, but no one can negotiate with them in view of uncertainty about the shipping
       problem. There is doubt as to how the Continental deal is coming out.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Giles said that U.S. exporters set out to lay down conditions which would result in
       using the least amount of U.S. shipping. Their purpose was to hold down the delivered price
       of U.S. wheat. The shippers came back with conditions which were quite unsatisfactory to the
       exporters. The Continental Company is now in a position to say that insufficient U.S.
       shipping is available to move the grain they are selling; <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0043"/>hence, they will be asking Commerce to waive the requirement that 50% of the
       grain be moved in U.S. bottoms.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WWW1">Wirtz</persName> said that the understanding reached
       within the Administration last November was that 50% of the U.S. grain would be moved in U.S.
       ships. He said the Commerce Department cannot set conditions which rule out the use of U.S.
       ships and then say that foreign ships can be used to move the wheat.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Giles said the understanding of last November was that 50% of U.S. shipping would be
       used, if available.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WWW1">Wirtz</persName> said the “if
       available” phrase was added at a later date. He said it was understood that
       conditions would not be imposed which would result in frustrating the 50% limitation. He said
       he understood that all had agreed that if we couldn't get 50% of the grain shipped
       in U.S. bottoms, the wheat sale to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would not be
       completed. He added that he was not saying that a waiver of the 50% requirement should not
       now be made.</p>
                        <p>Several others at the meeting did not agree that the understanding was as described by
       Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WWW1">Wirtz</persName>. Secretary Hodges said the agreement
       was to grant a waiver if U.S. ships were not available and he felt that it was possible that
       only 25% of the wheat sold by the Continental Company would be moved in U.S. bottoms.</p>
                        <p>In answer to a question by Mr. Feldman as to whether the labor unions would accept a waiver
       of the 50% shipping requirement, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WWW1">Wirtz</persName> said
       the unions would agree if the conditions affecting U.S. shipping were fair and if the reasons
       why the waiver was being granted were explained to the union leaders.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Freeman called attention to the decision to use smaller ships to move PL 480<note n="4" xml:id="d8fn4">Formally entitled the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance
        Act, enacted July 10, 1954; for text, see 68 Stat. 454.</note> wheat which had the effect of
       taking the smaller U.S. ships out of the shipping pool. He said now that we had cleared the
       air on the existing wheat contract, he believed that we should state all conditions involved
       in wheat shipments so that grain dealers can decide whether they should try to arrange future
       wheat sales to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>In an exchange between Mr. Giles and Secretary Freeman, an understanding was reached that
       it would be all right for the Continental Company to bunch up its shipments in February and
       March at a time when few U.S. ships would be available—hence, grain would be moved
       in foreign bottoms. Mr. Giles was interested in seeing that U.S. shipping firms benefited
       from this trade and Secretary Freeman was obviously <pb n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0044"/>seeking to keep the cost of shipping wheat down so as to make possible additional wheat
       sales.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WWW1">Wirtz</persName> said that the scheduling of the
       shipping of wheat was being used to alter the 50% policy decision. In effect, he said the
       position was now that we would use 50% U.S. shipping if the cost was equal to foreign
       shipping costs. He repeated his belief that the Administration had decided to pass up wheat
       sales to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> if it was not possible to move half of it
       in U.S. ships. The unions have gone along with U.S. policy when it has been explained to
       them. Trouble always occurs when they read of a U.S. decision in the newspapers and
       afterwards have it explained to them. The next time he hoped that it would be possible for
       the Government to consult the unions in advance of the announcement of any new policy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Feldman sought to summarize U.S. objectives as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. We want to sell wheat.</p>
                        <p>b. We want to use U.S. shipping, if possible, but the major objective is to sell wheat.</p>
                        <p>c. We want to help the U.S. maritime industry.</p>
                        <p>d. We want to convince the American people of the advantages of selling wheat to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Giles worried that the Administration would be conniving to get U.S. ships out of the
       trade if we require bunching up of wheat deliveries in February and March while the Soviets
       are willing to accept delivery in April.</p>
                        <p>The group agreed that Cargill should work out a shipping arrangement with the Russians. It
       would not be a condition that the delivery be made within a fixed period. The Government
       would not place a roadblock by requiring that wheat shipments could not be bunched. Cargill
       would then take the gamble involving the shipping costs.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Freeman raised again the long-range problem of wheat sales. He said he understood
       that Secretary Hodges would not waive the 50% shipping requirement on next year's
       spring crop. He asked that each Department do a paper on U.S. policy with respect to sales to
       the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> of the Ô64 wheat crop. He saw the
       alternatives as:</p>
                        <p>a. Putting wheat on the free list, like barley.</p>
                        <p>b. Working out a deal.</p>
                        <p>c. A Government-to-Government negotiation.</p>
                        <p>The purpose would be to avoid the U.S. Government subsidizing U.S. wheat sales to the
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WWW1">Wirtz</persName> introduced the difficulties he was
       having with the unions which are active in trying to block Cuban shipping. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BG1">Ball</persName> explained current U.S. policy toward Cuban shipments.
       Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WWW1">Wirtz</persName> repeated that it would have been
       easier to deal with the unions if he <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0045"/>had been able to
       tell them in advance how we were handling shipments to Cuba.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BG1">Ball</persName> reminded the group that, in discussing
       future wheat sales to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, the State Department had
       gone on record with the maritime nations which had protested the requirement to use U.S.
       ships in the Soviet wheat deal that the wheat sale was a one-shot operation and did not mean
       that in the future we would discriminate against foreign ships.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Hodges said Commerce would keep Labor informed currently on all aspects of the
       shipping problem. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WWW1">Wirtz</persName> was authorized to
       talk to the unions in advance of Commerce granting a waiver of the 50% shipping
        requirement.<note n="5" xml:id="d8fn5">As of February 6, 1964, sales of U.S. wheat to the
        Soviet Union since the October 1963 authorization of such sales totaled 1,700,000 metric
        tons. (American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1964, p. 633, footnote 11) In a May 24
        memorandum to the President, <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> reported that the
        outlook for another sale during the next few months was poor, unless Soviet weather turned
        sour. “Our evidence is that the Soviets found their last trade with us difficult
        and unrewarding, and will certainly not put us first in their list of possible
        sources.” (Johnson Library, National Security File, Memos to the
        President—McGeorge Bundy, Vol. 4)</note>

                        <p>On January 28, 1964, a Soviet fighter shot down a U.S. T–39 training aircraft over East
       Germany. The three U.S. officers aboard were killed. At noon on January 28 Secretary of
       Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> telephoned President Johnson to
       brief him on the incident. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> told Johnson the
       flight had been cleared “only for local flying,” but, probably due to
       bad weather and failure of its communication equipment, it had strayed into East German
       airspace. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> assured the President that the

       Kornienko the same day, are printed in American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1964,

       “inexcusably brutal act of violence against an unarmed aircraft.”</p>

                        <p>Recent developments in the Moscow negotiations for a United States-Soviet Consular
       Convention suggest that a possible impasse will be averted and that a useful convention will
       be concluded in the near future. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> recently offered
       us an important concession, promising that United States consular officials will be notified
       promptly and permitted quick access to United States citizens arrested and detained in the
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. This concession is conditioned on our accepting the
       Soviet demand for greater immunities to be enjoyed by consular officials.<note n="3" xml:id="d10fn3">In a January 31 memorandum for Bromley Smith, <persName corresp="#p_KD1">Klein</persName> reported that the “last stumbling block” in the
        negotiations was the “question of immunities for consuls. The Soviets clearly
        want to protect their consuls from arrest for espionage.” The “gut
        question is what happens in the case of espionage, and here the State Department is
        satisfied that expulsion is an available instrument for dealing with this
        problem.” (Johnson Library, National Security File, Country File, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, Consular Convention, Vol. I)</note> We have reached
       agreement within the Executive Branch on accepting this proposal and Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> briefed members of the Senate Foreign Relations

       looks as though we shall be able to reach final agreement with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in the relatively near future. The anticipated conclusion of a Consular

       will serve as a pattern for United States bilateral consular conventions with other Soviet

       agricultural exchanges by some 15% or more; educational and cultural-professional exchanges
       (artists, writers, musicologists, etc.) will increase very modestly; scientific, technical,
       medical, performing arts, athletic and motion picture exchanges will remain at the level of
       the last agreement. Soviet efforts to remove the reciprocal and other safeguards of previous
       agreements are still under negotiation. One key unresolved general issue hinges on Soviet

                        <p rend="center">The Problem</p>
                        <p>To estimate developments in Soviet foreign policy over the next year or so.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>A. An accumulation of serious internal and external problems led the Soviets by mid-1963 to
       make the shift in their foreign policy course signaled by the test ban treaty. The Cuban
       missile crisis, by its dramatic demonstration of the unfavorable relations of power, had
       forced a reappraisal of risks and opportunities for advance against the West. Internal
       economic difficulties were mounting and were sharpened by the burden of the arms race. The
       increasingly strident Chinese challenge to the Soviet leadership also stimulated the search
       for a new approach. (Paras. 1–9)</p>
                        <p>B. We believe that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> considers the present
       period inauspicious for direct pressures against the West and has adopted the relaxation of
       tensions as the main theme of his policy. He will probably avoid inflaming such sensitive
       issues as Berlin, or any others which carry the risk of direct confrontation with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. He probably hopes that in an improved international climate he
       can hold down defense costs, gain time to concentrate on internal and bloc problems, and
       encourage the West to grant the credits he needs. At the same time, he expects this line to
       aggravate Western differences, which tend to emerge <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0049"/>more strongly when the Soviet threat appears to fade. To sustain the improved climate, the
       Soviets are likely to complete current negotiations for certain bilateral agreements with the
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and seek limited understandings on disarmament and other
       matters. (Paras. 14–15, 17–18, 24–25, 27–29)</p>
                        <p>C. Nevertheless, the Soviets do not intend to curb their anti-Western policies in the
       underdeveloped world or to forego opportunities which might appear there. In fact, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> expects the relaxation of East-West tensions to
       increase the number of unstable situations which the Soviet can exploit. The Soviet interest
       in doing so is reinforced by competition with Communist China for leadership of the
       “national liberation struggle.” In addition, it is always possible that
       developments not initiated by the Soviets will require a demonstration of
       “firmness” on their part. Cuba is a prime example of this kind of
       contingency; Castro is in a position to embroil the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in
       serious situations with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> which would call for the
       Soviets to provide strong support for Cuba, although they will clearly wish to avoid another
       confrontation like that of 1962. (Paras. 16, 19, 20–21, 29–31)</p>
                        <p>D. The Soviets probably intend to follow their present policies for some time. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> with his customary optimism, however, almost
       certainly looks forward to the time when, having coped with his current problems, he can
       return to a more offensive course. In our view the factors which led to the adoption of
       present Soviet policies are not transitory; there is a good chance that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> underestimates his present difficulties and that
       these policies will tend to be stretched out beyond the relatively short period of this
       estimate. This does not mean that the present improvement in the international atmosphere is
       likely to evolve over a longer time into a more serious search for basic settlements with the
       West. More fundamental changes in the Soviet outlook than any now in prospect would be needed
       before the Soviets could bring themselves to such a course. (Para. 23)</p>

       viewed the Soviet leaders as caught up by indecision, hesitating in the face of the stark
       realities brought home by their failure in the Cuban missile crisis. This crisis had
       demonstrated not only the new dimensions of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> power but also
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> skill and determination in wielding it. In the aftermath,
       the Soviet leaders were still confronted by the very problems which their <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0050"/>Cuban missile venture had been intended to solve. The overall
       balance of power between East and West remained unfavorable. The economic strains of the arms
       competition loomed as costly as ever. The Chinese challenge to Soviet authority was growing
       in breadth and depth.</p>
                        <p>2. By mid-1963 it became apparent that a new overall approach to these various problems had
       been reached, at least in principle. In the economic sphere, short-term plans for 1964–1965
       were to be revised in order to shift sizeable amounts of resources to the chemical industry.
       Consistent with this new turn of economic policy was a shift in East-West tactics, manifested
       in <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s concessions to the Western
       position on the limited test ban. Almost simultaneously, the Soviets confronted the Chinese
       with a strong counterattack. The net result of these new moves was a notable relaxation of
       East-West tensions, some limited accords between East and West, and a significant widening of
       the gap between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and China.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Factors Affecting the Soviet Outlook</p>
                        <p>3. The considerations which led to this tactical turning of mid-1963 were, we believe,
       quite fundamental in character. They flowed from an accumulation of problems, partly inherent
       in the development of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the Bloc, and partly the
       specific byproduct of the generally offensive line of policy <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had pursued since he opened the Berlin crisis in 1958. These
       considerations are not merely transitory and will almost certainly continue to influence the
       Soviet policy outlook for some time.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">The Strategic Balance</hi>. The course on which Soviet policy launched
       in 1957–1958 was built on the expectation that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, for
       the first time in the post-war struggle, was about to acquire a major advantage in strategic
       weapons. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was evidently persuaded by this
       prospect to believe that the West could be forced into concessions. The intervening five
       years have demonstrated, however, not only that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was
       capable of resisting this challenge, but also that in the field of strategic weapons it could
       outpace the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The Soviets found that the heavy cost of
       the intensified arms race was incompatible with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s commitment both to a high growth rate to overtake the
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> economy and to a more rapid improvement in Soviet living
       conditions. By 1962, <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military and intelligence programs led
       to a situation in which both sides, and indeed much of world opinion, understood that the
       strategic advantage did not lie with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, even though
       the ability of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to damage the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was increasing. The Cuban missile venture was an attempt to achieve a quick and
       relatively inexpensive advance in both the substance and the image of Soviet power. Its
       failure has left the Soviets little choice but to find ways to contain the arms race and
       reduce its burden on the Soviet economy.</p>
                        <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0051"/>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Economic Policy</hi>. To a major degree, the present more moderate
       general line adopted by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> reflects the
       strains in the Soviet economy. Economic strength is only one ingredient in the balance of
       power, but <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has made it a key area of
       competition in his peaceful coexistence strategy. As the Soviet leaders contrast their own
       economic difficulties and the economic malaise in much of Eastern Europe with the vitality of
       Western Europe and the upturn in American economic growth rates, they have little reason for
       optimism. Because of the nature of these economic problems, they were bound to encroach on
       Soviet foreign relations.</p>
                        <p>6. The Soviets have adopted a new economic course which requires a major shift of
       resources; their aims are to stimulate agriculture, modernize industry, and revive the rate
       of economic growth. Moreover, the magnitude of the new investment effort for the chemical
       industry bears directly on Soviet relations with the West. The Soviets cannot provide the
       equipment needed for their chemical program without extensive purchases abroad; their hard
       currency deficits and the decline of their gold reserves oblige them to seek long-term
       credits for the necessary equipment. An effort to stimulate Western competition for orders
       from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on long-term credit is already under way.
       There are signs that preliminary understandings have been reached with the British and
       Italians. The Soviets almost certainly hope that one important breakthrough in the Western
       front will cause the other advanced industrial countries to fall into line.</p>
                        <p>7. Even a sharp increase in imports from the West, however, would not deal with a principal
       cause of Soviet difficulties—the heavy burden of military spending. We have
       estimated that the Soviets will make every effort to hold down rising military costs;<note n="3" xml:id="d11fn3">SNIE 11–5–64, “Soviet Economic Problems and
        Outlook,” dated 8 January 1964. Secret. [Footnote in the source text. Printed as
         <ref target="#d4">Document 4</ref>.]</note> the announced reduction of the defense budget,
       though modest, symbolizes the direction <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
       proposes to follow, and some force reductions are apparently intended. Progress along this
       line of economies in the defense establishment, however, depends greatly on a proper
       international climate. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s hopes
       to support his civilian investment program through Western credits and through savings from
       defense argue for some degree of restraint in his relations with the West.</p>
                        <p>8. The Problem of China. As they survey their international position, the Soviets are
       confronted by a third long-term problem. The vicious exploitation of the Cuban missile crisis
       by the Chinese deepened the Sino-Soviet dispute, and their subsequent attacks expanded to
       almost every facet of Soviet foreign and domestic policy. In counterattacking, the Soviets
       sought to use the test ban as an issue on which to <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0052"/>isolate China in world and even Communist opinion. This, however, proved illusory; trade
       and other contacts between China and Western Europe have increased in recent months, and
       Peiping's influence in the Communist world has, if anything, grown. The Soviets
       considered convening an international Communist conference to condemn China, but abandoned
       the idea, at least temporarily on learning that several key parties had grave reservations
       about such action.</p>
                        <p>9. The Soviet leaders appear now to have concluded that they will be locked in a severe
       struggle with China for a protracted period. They have evidently decided to pursue their own
       interests regardless of inevitable Chinese criticism, and despite the cost of further
       deterioration in Sino-Soviet relations and consequent fracturing of the international
       movement. The test ban treaty was an important manifestation that, on certain issues, the
       Soviets view their interests as paralleling those of the West rather than those of their
       Communist ally. Indeed, the Soviets are also prepared to use other issues as weapons against
       China, for example an agreement against dissemination of nuclear weapons and techniques, or
       an international pact for peaceful resolution of territorial disputes.</p>
                        <p>10. Soviet policy is complicated, however, by the competition with China in the
       underdeveloped areas. The Soviets cannot afford to appear less interested than China in
       militant struggle and must therefore present their policies in a revolutionary and
       anti-Western context. At the same time, the Soviets cannot afford to let this aspect of their
       policy damage their relations with existing regimes. In some instances, the pressure of
       Chinese competition may cause the Soviets to act more rapidly and vigorously than they might
       otherwise do. On some occasions, the Soviets may also resort to sharper tactics to undercut
       the Chinese, but we doubt that the Chinese factor alone would persuade the Soviets to take
       greater risks than otherwise seemed warranted. In general, the Chinese attempt to compete
       with the Soviets in exploiting opportunities in the underdeveloped areas imposes some limits
       on Soviet efforts to improve relations with the West.</p>
                        <p>11. Eastern Europe. The weakening of Soviet authority in Eastern Europe, which has been
       apparent for some time, has been greatly stimulated by the Sino-Soviet conflict. The
       Rumanians, for example, have successfully used the dispute as one lever in their own
       controversy with the Soviets. The trend is clearly for the East European regimes to look more
       to their own interests, although none has yet done this so forthrightly as the Rumanians. The
       Soviets will encounter increasingly difficult problems in Eastern Europe and the cohesiveness
       of the Soviet Bloc will suffer. Some regimes might balk at an increase in tensions which
       would damage their own economic dealings with the West. They might regard Cuba as more of a
       burden than an asset, or regard the <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25" facs="0053"/>struggle in the
       underdeveloped areas as a secondary issue. Some, like the Poles and East Germans, show
       nervousness over Soviet attitudes on certain arms control measures. The Soviets have already
       found it difficult to subordinate the Eastern European economies to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and the chances of organizing <gloss target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss> as a solid front against the Common Market have dwindled.</p>
                        <p>12. One important consequence of these developing trends is their impact on East
       Germany's position in Eastern Europe. If the other regimes proceed, however
       haltingly, toward a liberalization of controls, a greater degree of autonomy from Moscow, and
       an increase in Western contacts, East Germany will come under great pressures to follow suit.
       Failure to keep in step with the other regimes risks isolation and possibly similar pressures
       within the country as well. Moreover, in the Soviet view, if the East German regime could
       gain in acceptability and increase contacts and exchanges without serious internal troubles,
       it would become a much more suitable instrument of Soviet policy in Germany. At some point
       the increase of normal contacts might even make the East German proposal for confederation
       seem more plausible. However, the process of liberalization in East Germany is an extremely
       delicate one which could lead to serious instability, and the Soviets would not feel free to
       push it very far or fast.</p>
                        <p>13. Internal Soviet Politics. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s internal position is now probably stronger and his
       freedom of action apparently greater than a year ago. In the first months of 1963, it seemed
       that his authority had been checked, and that he felt it necessary to modify some of his
       policies. His ability to reconsolidate his position was probably due in part to the illness
       of Frol Kozlov, who, in retrospect, seems to have been a key figure in the internal
       contention. The viciousness of Chinese attacks, particularly in raising the sensitive
       question of border adjustments with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, may have also
       helped <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. At any rate, the question of how to
       deal with some of the issues under debate evidently has been settled in <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s favor. The state of Soviet agriculture,
       however, is a continuing liability, and problems affecting allocation of economic resources
       are still open. Nevertheless, we believe that on the whole <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s general position now seems strong enough so that
       internal politicking will not affect foreign policy in a major way over the next year or
       so.</p>
                        <p>14. Developments in the West. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> may also
       believe that he has grounds for confidence because of the signs of disunity in the Western
       Alliance. The Soviets probably believe the current frictions in the West, which are limited
       during periods of tension, will develop into more significant differences if the Soviets show
       a more amiable countenance. The divisions between the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and
       France are widening. At the same time, the Soviets see a new set of leaders in Europe and the
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, and they <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26" facs="0054"/>are of
       course aware that further changes may be forthcoming after elections in the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and next year in West
       Germany. The Communist parties of Western Europe have moved toward the “popular
       front” tactic, and the Soviets are probably encouraged to believe that important
       changes in the atmosphere of European politics may take place that would further undermine
       the solidarity of the Western Alliance.</p>
                        <p>15. The increasing strains in the Western Alliance come at a time when the Soviets are
       already keenly aware that a renewal of pressure tactics offers little promise for immediate
       gains and perhaps higher risks in the aftermath of the Cuban crisis. The current more
       moderate approach therefore recommends itself on grounds both of prudence and of opportunity.
       Even if <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> expects no early success by moving
       along this way, he probably believes that existing differences in the West can be greatly
       aggravated and perhaps even a new and rewarding opening created for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Specifically, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is likely to concentrate on the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to
       break the front on Western credits and to effectively oppose the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. The opening to the left in Italy and the prospect of a Labor Government in
       Britain may persuade <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> can be checked and perhaps even that some progress can be made
       toward Soviet objectives in Germany. De Gaulle, however, remains a great question mark, since
       the Soviets are obviously pleased by the difficulties he causes in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> but at the same time concerned that his nuclear capability should eventually
       become available to Germany. In any case, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
       looks forward to a period in which Soviet diplomacy can operate more effectively against the
       unity of the Western Alliance.</p>
                        <p>16. The Underdeveloped Areas. The Soviets seem to have made some new assessments of their
       policies in these areas. In the late 1950's, the decline of Western influence in
       traditional areas of predominance such as the Middle East and Africa encouraged the Soviets
       to believe that they could not only rapidly replace the West but lay the groundwork for
       Communist control. By 1960–1961, however, they had run into repeated troubles. They suffered
       setbacks and lost influence, and their earlier efforts showed only limited political gains.
       Recent events in Latin America, Asia, and Africa, however, have probably revived their
       confidence that new opportunities are emerging. Moreover, it has always been their view that
       a relaxation of East-West tensions was not intended to curb Soviet exploitation of such
       opportunities. Indeed, one of the arguments that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has made for the policy of peaceful coexistence was precisely that it
       would increase the number of unstable situations which the Soviets could turn to their
       advantage.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. General Strategy</p>
                        <p>17. The basic factors which led the Soviets to seek a reduction in cold war tensions make
       it likely that this more moderate approach will <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0055"/>continue for some time. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> probably
       considers this the most promising way to obtain economic concessions, to gain time to
       concentrate on internal problems, and to foster Western divisions. A serious deterioration in
       East-West relations would undercut internal policies, particularly any retrenchment in
       military spending, and would demolish the carefully built up case against the Chinese.</p>
                        <p>18. Accordingly, Soviet diplomacy will be active over a broad range of issues which hold
       some promise of agreement with the West. Partly in order to sustain the present atmosphere,
       the Soviets will probably move for completion this spring of the bilateral negotiations with
       the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> on cultural relations, on civil aviation, and on
       consular matters. They probably regard the period between now and the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> elections, however, as a difficult one in which to reach any important political
       agreements. The Soviets have already evidenced some concern over the recent change in the
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> leadership, and their view of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> politics is greatly influenced by a belief that proponents of accommodation are
       in constant conflict with advocates of bellicosity. At the present time, they have a
       substantial propaganda and prestige investment in the proposition that new and favorable
       trends emerged under President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>.</p>
                        <p>19. This more cautious approach applies mainly to situations over which the Soviets have
       firm control. To some degree it also influences their responses to new situations not of
       their own making. But we believe that the Soviets do not consider that the current mood of
       détente with the West is incompatible with a more forward and thrusting policy in
       the underdeveloped world; they hope this mood may even inhibit Western responses. They have
       lately involved themselves in developments in Cyprus and East Africa while at the same time
       soliciting credits in London. In the underdeveloped world generally the Soviets will continue
       to exploit trouble spots against Western interests, and to build up their own positions of
       influence. Nevertheless, in exploiting such situations, we believe that the Soviets will seek
       to avoid direct confrontations with the Western powers.</p>
                        <p>20. <hi rend="italic">Cuba</hi>. Such contradictory tendencies in Soviet policy are notably
       apparent in Cuba. Over the past year the Soviets have worked to defuse the Cuban situation by
       withdrawing Soviet troop contingents. They have also urged Castro to take up a more
       conciliatory attitude and have paid for this by enlarging their economic support. They appear
       prepared to take the risk of turning over the SAM system to Castro, in the expectation that
       it will not provoke a serious crisis with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. However,
       much of their calculation has rested on <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s estimate of the late President's intentions
       and personal statements and the Soviets are probably now concerned that the US may bring new
       pressures on Castro's regime.</p>
                        <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0056"/>
                        <p>21. The hope of placing some inhibition on US actions against Castro gives the Soviets
       another strong reason for keeping down East-West tensions. We think that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will make an effort to restrain Castro from direct
       clashes with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. But the Soviets will be under
       intermittent pressure from Castro to adopt a more active policy in supporting and exploiting
       revolutionary situations in Latin America, particularly in view of new tensions in the
       Caribbean. Castro is in a position to embroil the Soviets with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would find it extremely
       embarrassing to abandon Cuba. A sharp crisis, therefore, would create a serious dilemma for
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. We believe that in this event the Soviets
       would feel obliged to sacrifice improved relations with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
       in order to provide support for Castro, although they would not go so far as to renew the
       kind of confrontation produced by the 1962 missile crisis.</p>
                        <p>22. <hi rend="italic">The Succession</hi>. Another key uncertainty surrounding future
       Soviet policy stems from the succession to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.
       Even in the Soviet system, the style, skill and conceptions of the top leaders play a major
       role in the determination of choices and in the effectiveness with which policies are
       prosecuted. The Soviet party appears to be little better equipped to designate a clear
       successor than when Stalin died, and another power struggle is likely. We know little of the
       individual policy views of the potential successors, and it would not be unreasonable to
       assume that they diverge from <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in some
       respects. It is possible that a succession struggle could begin to affect the conduct of
       policy even before <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s departure,
       should he become incapacitated or his mental and physical powers deteriorate.<note n="4" xml:id="d11fn4">For a more detailed discussion of the succession question see NIE 11–63,
        “Main Trends in Soviet Foreign Policy,” 22 May 1963. Secret (Paras
        42–47). [Footnote in the source text.]</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>23. <hi rend="italic">The Longer Run</hi>. A longer term estimate is more difficult and
       uncertain, not only because of the succession question but also because of the way the Soviet
       leaders are likely to view the factors conditioning their policies. There is some evidence
       that they regard the present as a transitional period during which the struggle with the West
       is being carried forward mainly by the internal strengthening of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has repeatedly stressed
       over the past year that economic problems now take priority over political affairs, and most
       recently Soviet spokesmen have suggested that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s present position is analogous to the 1920's when Lenin
       introduced his New Economic Policy. It is doubtful, therefore, that the Soviet leaders regard
       their setbacks as more than temporary. It would be quite characteristic of Khrushchev to be
       optimistic and assume that he can solve his problems relatively soon and then return to the
       political offensive. Even <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0057"/>if the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> continues to be plagued by significant sources of economic
       weakness and an erosion of its authority in the international Communist movement, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is likely to rationalize these trends and only defer
       his expectations of regaining the momentum of the late 1950's. Largely because of
       this attitude, the Soviet leaders probably will not feel under any pressure to seek a major
       accommodation with the West, with all the great concessions this would entail. We think that
       it is possible, however, that the present tactical phase will be stretched out beyond the
       period which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> probably envisages.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Tactics in the Near Term</p>
                        <p>24. <hi rend="italic">Disarmament</hi>. As a result of the test ban, we think the chances
       for further limited agreements have improved. Economic pressures alone are a strong incentive
       for <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to take further steps to stabilize the
       arms race. The revival of partial measures rather than emphasis on general disarmament
       signifies a more realistic approach. However, the program outlined by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in the past months concentrates on agreements of
       symbolic political significance without offering important concessions on basic issues. The
       Soviets probably do not see much chance for any very broad or significant agreements in the
       near term, not only because of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> elections but mainly
       because most of their own proposals still lead back to the German question or cut across
        <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>'s military planning, including programs for
       nuclear sharing.</p>
                        <p>25. Regardless of the progress made toward formal agreements, a new approach has been
       gaining ground in Soviet pronouncements, illustrated by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s statement on “a policy of mutual example in
       the curtailment of the arms race.” Under this formula, the Soviets apparently hope
       that overt steps by one side will ease the way for corresponding steps by the other. This
       approach has the obvious advantages of maintaining control over the pace and scope of such
       steps and of avoiding formal commitments and verification procedures. Moreover, the Soviets
       can apply this approach to areas where the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would find it
       politically difficult or undesirable to take reciprocal measures, especially in Central
       Europe.</p>
                        <p>26. Berlin and Germany. Any relaxation of tensions implies, above all, a Soviet willingness
       to forego heavy pressures and threats to the Western position in Berlin. Currently, the
       Soviets have in fact not only relaxed their pressures, but have taken new steps to bring
       their Berlin and German policies into line with the broader effort to rely more on
       negotiations. Throughout last year the Soviets undertook various approaches suggesting a
       policy of experimentation and probing to find a new direction along which Soviet policy could
       work. The establishment of contacts and negotiations between West Berlin and East Germany <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0058"/>represents the first concrete result, and probably
       indicates the way the Soviets hope to play the Berlin question for the near term.</p>
                        <p>27. We do not foresee a major crisis over Berlin this year. Instead, it is likely that the
       Soviets and East Germans will try to work for partial agreements, preferably by dealing
       directly with Bonn or the West Berlin authorities. They apparently now see some new
       opportunity to advance their aims of creating an independent political entity in West Berlin
       and gaining a measure of acceptance for Ulbricht's regime. Even if no specific
       agreements are forthcoming, the Soviets probably hope that with elections next year in West
       Germany, the Socialists and Christian Democrats can be encouraged to compete in taking a new
       and more flexible approach to Eastern policy. Soviet overtures to the new Chancellor in Bonn
       are also to be expected. It is also possible that the Soviets might revive direct talks with
       the US; if so, they will probably further modify their proposals for a nonaggression pact to
       provide some guarantees for West Berlin and its access.</p>
                        <p>28. Despite the new flexibility in the Soviet approach and the lessening of tensions
       surrounding the Berlin issue, there is as yet no evidence that the Soviets have made any
       fundamental changes of position. Indeed, it is doubtful that the Soviet leaders would
       consider that their economic difficulties or troubles with China require them to make the
       concessions which would be necessary for a broad German settlement. This does not preclude a
       temporary stabilization of the Berlin problem, though the Soviets need not enter into
       agreements to keep the situation quiet. As long as there is no settlement, however, incidents
       are inevitable, and the Soviets will not hesitate to chip away at the allied position by
       trying to exact small concessions as the price for continued restraint. For these reasons, it
       is unlikely that a more serious search for an East-West settlement in Europe will
       develop.</p>
                        <p>29. The Underdeveloped Areas. Soviet policy toward the underdeveloped countries will
       continue to be marked by a high degree of opportunism. The Soviets probably count on an
       increase in recent manifestations of tension and instability in various parts of the world,
       developments which though often not of Communist making are almost invariably unfavorable to
       the Western powers. They have already made it clear that the limited rapprochement with the
       West does not apply to the underdeveloped areas. They will not wish to forego opportunities
       there which the Chinese might seize upon. On the other hand, they will try to avoid the more
       direct and obvious forms of intervention in order not to compromise the general line of their
       policy toward the Western powers. They probably foresee a long period of ferment which can be
       turned to Soviet advantage with a minimum of involvement on their part and a low risk of
       direct clashes with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>30. A foreign aid program will continue to be a major instrument of Soviet policy for the
       developing countries. Economic assistance, <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0059"/>however,
       has been reduced from the previous high levels of the late 1950's and stricter
       criteria have been applied in the choice of recipients. The limited political gains derived
       from this program and the psychological atmosphere created by economic difficulties at home
       probably contribute to a reluctance to undertake major new commitments in unproven territory.
       Military aid, however, which sometimes promises quicker returns, will continue to loom large
       in Soviet calculations, and we expect the circle of clients to expand.</p>
                        <p>31. Efforts at subversion continue, as evidenced by recent revelations of Soviet
       involvement in the Congo and Communist activity in East Africa. The Soviets almost certainly
       realize that in many of the underdeveloped states the fabric of authority is extremely thin,
       sometimes offering opportunities for even small Communist groups without mass backing to
       achieve power by sudden coups. In most cases, however, the Soviets will continue to see their
       objectives as better served by supporting non-Communist nationalist leaders. Thus, despite
       the pressures of Chinese competition, we do not foresee a general shift to a militant
       revolutionary policy toward the underdeveloped world.</p>

                        <p>I started conversation by noting considerable progress we had made on bilateral issues
       since our last tour d'horizon in December. Specifically, we had concluded a
       promising exchange agreement, we had agreed on a program for cooperation in atomic energy and
       outer space fields, the Soviet had accepted our proposal to begin bilateral discussions on
       satellite communications problems, we had concluded a mutually beneficial wheat deal and
       finally, we appeared to be on the threshold of an agreement on a consular convention.</p>
                        <p>With regard to consular convention negotiations, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was aware that we had effected a fundamental change in traditional
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy on immunities in order to accommodate Soviet
       desires. This had not been an easy task for Washington and we had been able to secure
       agreement of interested agencies on a new position primarily on the understanding that the
       Soviet side would be prepared to meet our position on balance of outstanding issues. Recent
       attempts on the part of the Soviet side to amend certain convention articles had therefore
       caused considerable concern in Washington. I had only this morning received a message from
       Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> indicating that such developments
       could cause serious difficulties, particularly re ratification process.<note n="3" xml:id="d12fn3">Telegram 2569 to Moscow, February 27. (National Archives and Records

       therefore, that we could resolve current impasse through agreement to original <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> language on disagreed articles. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he had not reviewed question in detail but he had impression that
       the negotiations were proceeding well.</p>
                        <p>With regard to wheat deal <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> noted that the
       situation had improved within last few days and he had understood from <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that this was primarily the result of personal
       intervention by the President. The President's efforts were deeply
       appreciated.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that the Dept, and I personally, were
       unhappy at the delays in reaching satisfactory settlement of the Soviet building problem in
       Washington. He could be assured that the Dept would continue to use its influence in bringing
       the issue to a satisfactory close although he would recognize that our influence in the
       matter was somewhat limited. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> expressed
       appreciation for the Dept's interest and noted wryly that perhaps Dobrynin should
       meet his house problem by erecting a large tent in Washington area and play host to the
       district court judges without showing them excessive hospitality.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I told <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that while I was not
       informed on the most recent Washington developments with regard to the civil air agreement I
       was sure that this would be on my agenda for discussion in Washington. Meanwhile, I could
       inform him that the Dept. was gratified to learn of the Soviet affirmative action on our
       request for a leased-line.</p>

                        <p>As I left <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> I asked him casually if he could
       give me any information on <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
       travel plans, noting that I had heard rumors that he intended to visit Egypt in the near
       future. Noting with some amusement that obviously I had access to secret information,
        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had been invited to visit Egypt but until now no official statement
       on his plans had been issued. I believe we can interpret his remarks to mean that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has in fact decided to visit Egypt in the spring and
       the current rumors that he will attend the Aswan Dam ceremonies are thus probably
       accurate.</p>

       is in response to your request made in November to study and report on possible projects for
       substantive cooperation with the Soviet Union on outer space. The report represents a
       consensus among <gloss target="#t_NASA1">NASA</gloss>, State, Defense, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, the Science Advisor, and the Executive Secretary of the Space
       Council.</p>
                        <p>In brief, the report contains guidelines to govern negotiations with the Soviet Union that
       have a reasonable chance of success, yet protect our national interests. It proposes a
       graduated approach calculated to develop mutual confidence, exchange information, and lay the
       foundation for consultative planning of specific projects. Careful consideration has been
       given to cultivating favorable Congressional and public attitudes. The specific proposals now
       being considered all relate to a joint program of unmanned flight projects to support a
       manned lunar landing.</p>

                        <p>No immediate public action is recommended because we are in need of Soviet performance on
       present agreements. We will continue to show interest, through the existing
       Dryden-Blagonravov channel, in obtaining a positive Soviet answer to the proposals for
       cooperation already made by President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and by
       you. Meanwhile, we will watch the performance of the Soviet Union under existing
       agreements.</p>
                        <p>The Administrator is keeping this program under his continuing personal review and clearly
       understands your interest in it. He will keep you advised of progress and may call upon you
       for further initiative sometime around the first of May; by then the Soviet Union will have
       had ample opportunity to make clear its intentions.</p>

       U.S.S.R. had gone. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that he had been
       informed by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that the Delegation
       was interested in visiting other ports such as Novorossiysk, Klaipeda, etc., and that he had
       no objection and had issued the necessary instructions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Martin replied that he had come to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in order
       to expedite the wheat deliveries from the United States to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and that all problems which he had come to discuss had been satisfactorily
       resolved. He expressed his gratitude for the efficient and cordial manner in which Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s ministers, Messrs. Bakayev and
       Patolichev, had cooperated in solving these problems.<note n="2" xml:id="d14fn2">A memorandum
        of Martin's conversation with Patolichev on March 3 is ibid., FT 4 <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</note> Mr. Martin pointed
       out that since the Delegation's arrival in Moscow on Monday afternoon it had <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0064"/>not wasted any time but had been busy from morning until
       late at night. The visit to Odessa had been most interesting and useful, and the hospitality
       accorded the Delegation, as well as the technical information furnished, could not have been
       any better. He repeated that all major problems had been solved. In reply to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s invitation to stay on and visit the Great
       Kremlin Palace, Mr. Martin said that he was now anxious to return to Washington so that the
       problems at that end could be handled expeditiously.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that he admired American
       businessmen's efficiency and that Soviet businessmen too were quite efficient,
       that unfortunately Americans did not know them too well, in fact knew very little about the
       Soviet Union, its great productive capacity in machine building, and that, while the present
       wheat deal did constitute a beginning, actually very little trade was being carried on
       between the United States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>When Secretary Martin pointed out that in 1963 this trade had increased by 23% over the
       preceding year, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> stated that this was still
       a mere trickle. Why could not this trade be expanded further in the same manner as had been
       done between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the United Kingdom, the Federal
       Republic of Germany, Italy, Japan, and many other countries. He was surprised at the fact
       that the American press and even government representatives, as well as business circles took
       the position that the Soviet Union did not have anything to sell to the United States. If the
       two leading powers in today's world, leading in industry, technology, science,
       etc., could not trade with each other, how did they expect to trade with countries of Africa,
       Asia, etc. It seemed to him that one of the main reasons for this lack of trade was American
       lack of information about Soviet industrial capacity. He cited the following examples: The
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was furnishing machinery to many European countries
       but would like to receive similar machinery orders from the United States. Another aspect of
       trade which was being largely ignored was trade in licenses (i.e. patents and know-how). He
       thought that a great deal could be done in this respect, but the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was not interested in one-way trade only, a balance had to be established
       which would make such trade profitable to both sides. He understood very well that neither
       the United States nor the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> were in the philanthrophy
       business, trade had to be mutually profitable. Therefore, the United States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should work together. This, of course, involved long-term
       agreements such as had been concluded by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> with many
       other countries; it further involved credits. The Soviet Union was also selling machinery on
       credit to its customers.</p>
                        <p>At this point Mr. Martin, turning to Assistant Secretary Reynolds, told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> that Mr. Reynolds handled labor problems in the United
       States Government and invited Mr. Reynolds to speak. Mr. Reynolds <pb n="37" xml:id="pg_37" facs="0065"/>said that if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was interested
       in some of the details of the United States economy, he would like to tell him something
       about it. United States production was at an all-time high with a gross national product of
       almost 600 billion per annum. Nevertheless, the United States had certain problems such as
       unemployment of 4.1 million or 5.6% of our total labor force. The United States Government
       had recently put through a tax cut in the amount of 11 billion dollars in the expectation
       that it would result in increased investment on the part of consumers. In this manner our
       Government hoped to increase our gross national product by 35 billion dollars, and thereby
       recoup the losses in tax revenues. Approximately 7 billion of the total tax cut would wind up
       in the hands of working people. In addition, our Government was taking steps to retrain
       people who had been displaced by automation. Mr. Reynolds estimated that some 30,000 to
       35,000 jobs per week were being eliminated by automation so that retraining was an important
       measure to combat further unemployment. He stated that in the United States people were now
       working an average of 42 to 42 1/2 hours per week, that the Government was opposed to a
       reduction of work-week hours, but that unless the United States managed to solve the
       unemployment problem in other ways, it might eventually have to consider a reduction of
       work-week hours.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> pointed out that, while unemployment did
       not exist and never would exist in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, Soviet workers
       at the present time were working 7 hours a day for 5 days and 6 hours on Saturday. The work
       week had been and was now being reduced, indeed some factories had already gone to a 5-day 40
       hour week, but this kind of a change involved a loss of 1 hour per week or a total of 52
       hours a year. He said that in the Soviet Union wages had not as yet reached a level mentioned
       by Secretary Reynolds earlier ($2.46 per hour average industrial wage), but that there were
       many free services and benefits which the Soviet worker received in addition to his wages;
       for example, extremely low rent (as a matter of fact the Soviet housing industry was being
       run at a loss, subsidized by the government budget), free medical care, hospitalization,
       vacations, sanitoriums, etc. Education was completely free regardless of the
       student's family origin. He pointed to a decree of the Council of Ministers which
       was being published today permitting pensioners to resume work without losing all of their
       pension. He stressed that the Soviet trade unions played a most active part in the management
       and economic and political life of the country. He pointed to the fact that Soviet wages were
       gradually being increased without a corresponding increase in prices.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Reynolds stated that for the past several years the United States had maintained a
       fairly stable economy in a monetary sense; the wholesale price level had risen only .5% since
       1957, while the retail price level <pb n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0066"/>had been rising at
       an average rate of .1% per month. Our economy was at an all time high, we had added 100
       billion dollars to the national product just in the last three years. As to the social and
       medical services, Mr. Reynolds pointed out that we consider it to be better for private
       industry to assume responsibility for workers welfare. There were 60 billion dollars in
       pension funds which were being used to supplement the Federal Government pensions a retired
       worker receives. The United States had free and independent trade unions which would this
       coming summer be involved in negotiations with the automobile industry. The latter had had
       several very good years, producing 7 million cars last year, and the unions now wanted a
       larger share of the profits. But no one would benefit if both wages and prices increased
       proportionately. Therefore the Government was interested in maintaining stability of
       prices.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> stated that Soviet trade unions were
       even more free and independent, so much so in fact that if he did not do a good job the trade
       unions would not permit him to take a vacation. He went on to say that the Soviet Union had
       no intention of producing as many autos as the United States, that in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> production would be concentrated on buses and large taxi
       pools. When Minister Bakayev pointed out that taxis were very cheap in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
       laughingly said that just the same Mr. Bakayev did not use taxis but had his own car. He
       pointed out that in Siberia, for example, the weather of 30–40 degrees below C. in winter
       presented special problems for automobiles. He had a great deal of respect for the
       productivity of American industry but had to point out that in some fields of Soviet industry
       productivity was very high; a specific example was steel: 80 million tons of steel had been
       produced last year at low cost by a continuous casting process which was being utilized more
       and more. He said that a group of American businessmen had expressed interest in purchasing
       the licenses for this process, but apparently nothing had come of it even though such
       licenses had been sold to other Western countries. He went on to mention the chemical
       industry, stating that in 1965 the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would produce
       approximately 35 million tons of chemical fertilizer which would be equal to the quantity
       produced in the United States. As for Soviet agriculture, natural conditions in the Soviet
       Union were more difficult, making it harder to equal United States agriculture in
       productivity per man. Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had a great
       deal of admiration for American agriculture and had become something of a specialist in
       it.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Martin pointed out that the Delegation included a representative of the United
       States Department of Agriculture, Mr. Vickery, and that he had a great deal of wheat for
       sale. To this Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> replied that Mr. Vickery
       apparently worked with one hand only, <pb n="39" xml:id="pg_39" facs="0067"/>selling, but did
       not use his other hand for buying; he repeated that trade must be a two-way road.</p>
                        <p>The discussion turned to scientific exchanges and to the late President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s proposal of a possible joint expedition to
       the moon. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and United States should not only go to the moon together but
       also live here on earth together. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> for a
       third time repeated his desire to see increased U.S.-U.S.S.R. trade with a long-term trade
       agreement and credits and stated that it was not enough to say that all political problems
       must be solved before trade could be increased. Improvement in political matters and in trade
       should be parallel. In closing the conversation after another exchange of compliments,
       Secretary Martin repeated his thanks for the cooperation and hospitality which had been shown
       his Delegation by various Soviet Government officials.<note n="3" xml:id="d14fn3">On March 12

                        <p>Having expected an appointment on Saturday morning March 7 I rather tardily learned that
       the President wished to see me on Friday evening, March 6. I arrived there precisely at 6:00
       p.m. and saw the President from 6:20 until 6:50 p.m. The President came out with a visitor,
        <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0068"/>greeted me by first name and invited me into the
       office. He asked me first about the Soviet attitude toward his administration. I replied that
       the Soviets had been very reassured by the nature of his public statements after the
       assassination of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, by the first
       exchange of correspondence between him and Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and by the President's talk with Deputy Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> at the time of the funeral.<note n="2" xml:id="d15fn2">For memoranda of <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>'s conversations

       been reinforced by his moving ahead with current business, notably the sending of <gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss> Chairman Najeeb Halaby to Moscow to go ahead with the Air
        Agreement.<note n="3" xml:id="d15fn3">For a report on Halaby's trip to the Soviet
            Union, December 8–18, 1963, see ibid., <ref target="frus1961-63v05#d389">Document 389</ref>.</note> I said
       I was sure that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had hoped to be able to
       have a meeting with the President early in his administration. I thought that he and the
       Russian leadership in general now understood the President's constitutional
       problem and his unwillingness to absent himself from the United States until after the
       forthcoming elections. However, I believed that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> still regarded his relationship with the President as not yet firmly
       established and would not do so until he had had a chance to talk with him face to face. I
       was, therefore, sure that the Chairman would be interested in moving toward a meeting within
       a reasonable period after the elections. I personally hoped that such a meeting would take
       place some time after the elections, though I realized that this involved problems connected
       with Allied relationships on which the Secretary would be advising him.</p>
                        <p>In reply to the President's query I told him that I felt strongly that we should
       go ahead with the Air Agreement and that the Russians put considerable significance on this
       as a specific token of our readiness to proceed to practical agreements. However, I
       understood that there were some doubts and hesitations on this subject in Washington, notably
       on the part of Assistant Secretary Mann.<note n="4" xml:id="d15fn4">Assistant Secretary of
        State for Inter-American Affairs Mann expressed his doubts in a February 13 memorandum to
         <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, stating that the signing of the U.S.-Soviet
        Civil Air Agreement would undermine efforts to keep Cuba isolated and make more difficult
        U.S. efforts to persuade Latin American and African countries to deny landing and overflight
        rights to bloc aircraft. (National Archives and Records Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1964–66, AV 4 <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>) In a February 5 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> sought to
        counter Mann's views by emphasizing the agreement's advantages, the
        greatest of which he thought was “a psychological one. As a result of their
        quarrel with the Chinese Communists, their internal economic difficulties, and the growing
        independence of the Eastern European Communist countries, the Soviet regime will be faced in
        the next year or two with some major decisions which could basically influence Western
        relations for many years to come.” U.S. willingness to conclude bilateral
        agreements would help provide an alternative to the Chinese hard line. (Ibid., S/AL Files:
        Lot 67 D 2, Staff Memos, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>)
         <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> incorporated the views of both men in <ref target="#d22">Document 22</ref>.</note> I said I would be discussing this <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0069"/>matter with the Secretary and other officials involved during my
       consultations in Washington.</p>
                        <p>The President asked about relationships between Moscow and Peiping and I repeated the
       thesis of the Embassy in Moscow as to the national-interest nature of the conflict, in terms
       of Russian unwillingness to share the wealth with the Chinese Communists or to be led into a
       confrontation with the U.S. by Chinese initiatives, as well as of the factors of the
       unsettled boundary between the two countries and of the personal antipathy between <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and Mao.</p>
                        <p>The President indicated great interest in Soviet policies toward Cuba and asked whether
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> did not understand that this was
       politically very difficult for him. I replied that I thought <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> did have some appreciation of the domestic political aspects of this
       question and said that I was sure the Chairman had cancelled a planned trip to Cuba in
       December in order not to jeopardize his relationship with the President. I also said that I
       felt confident that the Soviets had in fact removed all combat troops and that they were
       moving toward a reduction in their training missions. However, I pointed out that Cuba was
       practically the only success to which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> could
       point in the foreign field for a long period of time. His maintenance of his position in Cuba
       also had its importance in terms of his world-wide conflict with the Chinese Communists for
       the allegiance of the communist parties and for influence in the lesser developed
       countries.</p>
                        <p>The President asked about Soviet attitudes towards the Republicans, with particular respect
       to Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and Goldwater. I said it would be no
       exaggeration to say that the Soviets regarded and portrayed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> as their U.S. Enemy No. 1 and Senator Goldwater as the Devil Incarnate. I
       therefore thought that they would try to stay strictly out of anything which might be
       regarded as interference in U.S. politics, but that they particularly would do nothing which
       they thought would facilitate the political prospects of either of the gentlemen named.</p>
                        <p>Shortly before 7:00 the President proposed that we go downstairs to the Mess Room to attend
       a farewell party being given for Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. </p>

                        <p>On March 10, 1964, Soviet aircraft intercepted and shot down a U.S. RB–66 aircraft in East
       German airspace. President Johnson's reaction to the incident and ensuing
       discussion in the White House are documented <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0070"/>in <ref target="frus1964-68v15#d19">

       Reconnaissance Center's program and procedures with a view to detecting missions
       with “an incident potential” but noted “that the RB–66
       training flight was not a part of the JRC program nor did this flight come under JRC
       jurisdiction. However, the question of routine navigation and training flights under local
       commanders was not considered as a separate entity for purposes of this
       discussion.” (Memorandum for the record; National Security Council, 303 Committee,
       Minutes 1964)</p>
                        <p>In its March 11 note protesting the intrusion, the Soviet Government claimed the
       “plane had penetrated into G.D.R. territory with the special purpose of conducting
       military reconnaissance.” Ambassador at Large <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> categorically denied the assertion in his oral reply to Soviet
       Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> the next day. For text of the
       Soviet note and a summary of the U.S. reply, see American Foreign Policy: Current Documents,
       1964, pages 528–531. In a meeting with Dobrynin on March 19, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> expressed regret over the incident but insisted the plane
       was not on any mission in East Germany. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> contended
       that the Soviet military had acted too fast in shooting down the plane and requested prompt
       return of the fliers. A memorandum of the conversation is in <ref target="frus1964-68v15#d21">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964–1968, volume XV, Document 21</ref>. At a
       second meeting 2 days later, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> that the Soviet Government viewed with satisfaction his
       statement of regret and would release the fliers soon. (Memorandum of conversation;

                        </p>
                        <p rend="center">Introduction and Conclusions</p>
                        <p>Neither the nature of the Soviet system nor the record of Soviet history suggests that the
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> can undergo orderly dynastic change. There is no
       statute, no article in the Constitution, which provides for the selection of a single leader
       of the Soviet party and state. More important, there is no tradition in Soviet politics of a
       systematic and harmonious succession; there is, rather, a record on conflict over power
       and—as Stalin and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would
       testify—a pattern of the survival of the fittest. Thus, when the supreme ruler
       dies, his heirs are likely to fall out, and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> may
       then enter upon an extended period of policy debate and political contention.</p>
                        <p>It is not possible, of course, to predict with precision or certainty the outcome of the
       next succession crisis in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. But, while neither we
       nor the Soviets themselves can name the man who will someday succeed <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, that man is probably at this moment sitting on the
       Presidium of the <gloss target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss>. And, while we cannot identify the
       policies that this successor will follow after his advent to power, the outline of these
       policies may already be at least faintly visible in the murk of current Soviet political
       controversy and in the changing form of Soviet society as a whole. Thus it is possible to
       speculate about the political climate at the time of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s departure and to consider the nature of those who will
       seek to succeed him.</p>
                        <p>We have surmised in the essay which follows that, while there are pronounced individual
       differences between the men now at the top of the Soviet hierarchy, most of them tend to look
       at the world through the eyes of the party apparatchiki and represent collectively a fairly
       conservative body of opinion. Some, although loyal followers of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, seem to have a hard time keeping up with him, and others, less
       devoted to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, seem at times to resist both
       his specific reforms and the general direction of his policies. In the aftermath of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s death, there may be a tendency for the
       various contenders to divide into two groups, those who would to one degree or another
       advocate a continuation of the Khrushchevian status quo, and <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0072"/>those who would perhaps disavow <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s reformism and propose a return to more traditional ways
       of doing things, both at home and abroad. Such a cleavage is already apparent in Soviet
       politics and could become of much greater significance during the policy debates likely to
       occur during a succession crisis.</p>
                        <p>As was the case after the death of Stalin, the battle for the top probably will be centered
       on and conducted within the top echelons of the party during its initial stages. The various
       contenders, however, will have to take account of the interests of other groups in Soviet
       society (the government apparatus, the military establishment, etc.) and, in time and under
       certain circumstances, the role of these groups could come to have an important, if indirect,
       bearing on the outcome of the struggle. Should, for example, the voice of protest of the
       liberal intellectuals continue to mount in intensity, and should the temper of the people
       become increasingly receptive to such protest, one or another leader might deem it profitable
       to champion the popular cause. Other “outside” pressures on the
       contenders will almost certainly include the policies of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Communist China. Although there is probably little that either country can
       do to determine the course of the succession struggle, the attitudes and intentions of both
       countries will be a major ingredient of debate, and the political fortunes of the individual
       leaders and their factions will in part rise and fall on the basis of the successes and
       failures of their policies, including their foreign policies.</p>

       considered under the following headings:</p>

                        <p>2979. Approach of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s 70th
       birthday April 17 will presumably give rise to some speculation in West about his possible
       retirement. In this connection, pundits may well recall statement of February 27, 1963 that
       we could not go on forever and attempt to rationalize that ideal time for step-down is
       now.</p>
                        <p>In Embassy's view there seems little warrant for such speculation. We have never
       been sure that there was much substance to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s “retirement” statement of last
       year, and if there was, it should be read as reflection <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s shaky power position in post-Cuba period rather than of
       indication <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s own desires. In any
       case, situation has changed considerably. Even if <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> should want to give up premiership and become, perhaps, Chairman of
       Presidium of Supreme Soviet (which would still enable him participate in future summit
       meetings), he could not possibly step down now in face Chinese polemics against him
       personally.</p>
                        <p>May be noted that as spring approaches this year Soviets are facing some unusually serious
       problems apart from China. Winter wheat crop, which they are banking on more than usual, may
       be possibly quite poor. Soviet youth and labor are restless and food shortage has people
       disgruntled. Authorities seem edging toward more repressive measures to improve discipline,
       as perhaps implied in March 19 Izvestiya report of Rudenko speech in Central Committee
       calling for “further strengthening socialist legality and law and
       order”.</p>
                        <p>In sum, complex of all these factors make it unlikely that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will consider it wise give up any of his present jobs in immediate
       future.</p>

                        <p>I was quite fascinated by the Agency's study on the coming struggle for power in
       the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.<note n="2" xml:id="d19fn2">
                                <ref target="#d17">Document 17</ref>.</note> This is by far the best thing I have seen on
       this subject and I think, in the main, quite sound. I do have a few comments, however, which
       I hope will be of interest.</p>
                        <p>Many of the judgments in this report would be affected by the circumstances of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s disappearance from the scene. Most of
       them seem predicated upon his dying a natural death. Should, however, he voluntarily retire
       from his two principal positions and take the presidency, many of the appraisals in this
       report would, I think, be changed. This would be even more so if he were forced out or kicked
       upstairs.</p>
                        <p>I have always assumed that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
       positions as head of the Party and head of the Government would be divided with Brezhnev,
       Podgorny, and Kosygin being the principal contenders. If this happened, I should think the
       split between the Party and the bureaucracy could develop rapidly. If, in order to prevent
       this, one man gets both jobs, I should think it would be difficult, at least in the early
       stages, for the bureaucrats and technocrats to exercise their influence.</p>
                        <p>One subject which is not touched on in the study, but which seems to me important, is the
       influence the press would have at the time of succession. As matters now stand, Izvestiya
       tends to be a <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> organ, while Pravda is more
       likely to carry opposition views. Adzhubei <note n="3" xml:id="d19fn3"> Alexis I. Adzhubei,
        editor of Izvestia and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
        son-in-law.</note> is a complete opportunist and would quickly jump on whatever he thought
       would be the leading bandwagon, but I should imagine that changes in the editorship of the
       leading papers might be one of our first clues as to who was succeeding in the power
       struggle.</p>
                        <p>Although I agree that <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> seems more likely
       than <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName> to be tapped as the heir, I am inclined
       to think <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName> would be more likely to come out on
       top in the long run as I do not believe <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> has
       the qualities to hold a leadership.</p>
                        <p>Although Polyansky is very much the Party type, I think he was much impressed by his visit
       to the United States and might not be as much of a conservative as is indicated in your
       study.</p>

       Venus is now in flight. He expressed grave concern about a <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> story by John
       Finney revealing that two previous Soviet efforts to reach Venus had been failures.<note n="2" xml:id="d20fn2"> Finney's article, “2 Venus Probes by Soviet
                        Failed,” which appeared in <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi> on April 1, stated that the launch
        failures had not been made public by either the Soviet Union or the United States but
        “were detected by the electronic network maintained by this country to monitor
        Soviet space activities.”</note> He said the <gloss target="#t_USIB1">USIB</gloss>, which was now meeting, would probably recommend to the President that the
       Board be authorized to conduct an investigation to determine how this information reached the
       press. The Times story was similar to one which appeared in the Washington Post lending
       support to the thesis that the newsmen were briefed rather than having written their stories
       by astute reconstruction of information already in the public domain. (At the end of the
       meeting, and apparently in response to a written note which Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> gave him, the President directed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> to initiate an investigation of this matter.)</p>

       he had any matters which he wished to raise. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> made the following points:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion of Cambodia.]</p>
                        <p>b. <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>—<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s current visit to Hungary is being very closely

       The Premier's speech stressing the importance of goulash as contrasted to the
       support of revolution may be an indication that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is giving priority to the unfinished business in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. If he now chooses to put first emphasis on improving
       economic conditions in the Soviet Union, it may mean that he will adopt a moderate attitude
       toward international problems.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> agreed with the great importance which
       Director <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> attached to the split between the
       Russian and the Chinese Communists. He said there would be a revolutionary change in world
       affairs if these two powers split completely. If the security tie between the two countries
       is cut, the Chinese would not be able to count on Soviet support if they attacked Southeast
        Asia.<note n="4" xml:id="d20fn4">In his April 2 memorandum for the record, <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> summarized <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s statement on the Sino-Soviet split as follows:

                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>I felt a need even earlier to send you a message of this content. But I put it off somehow,
       thinking that perhaps the reasons for which I decided to address myself to you would not be
       rightly understood. Now, I believe, you will understand me correctly.</p>
                        <p>During the last few months there have occurred one incident after another, causing much
       unpleasantness and adding to the tension in the already complicated relations between our two
       countries.</p>
                        <p>In the first place some member of the United States Armed Forces assigned to the Federal
       Republic of Germany and West Berlin wanted to change, without prior permission, the procedure
       for checking documents of military personnel on the routes of communication with West Berlin
       passing through the territory of the German Democratic Republic. To be sure, United States
       Government organs insisted in the correspondence carried on subsequently through diplomatic
       and military channels that the Soviet side had changed the conditions while the Americans
       adhered to the old rules that had been agreed upon. But I can assure you that this was not so
       at all. We did not change anything in the procedure for checking documents of the military
       personnel of the United States, Great Britain and France. On the contrary, the American
       command adopted some sort of internal instructions changing the practice agreed upon, and
       required that others take this into account.</p>
                        <p>Why do I come back to this question? If this were an isolated act, it could have been taken
       as constituting an unpleasant occurrence, but unfortunately similar acts are not few in
       number and it is not always easy to avoid the impression: are these not links in the same
       chain with which certain circles are striving to keep the United States of America and the
       Soviet Union from throwing off the shackles of the “Cold War"?</p>
                        <p>Incidents on the ground have finally been settled. Now they happen in the air.<note n="2" xml:id="d21fn2">See <ref target="#d9">Documents 9</ref> and <ref target="#d16">16</ref>
        concerning the incidents on January 28 and March 10.</note> On January 28, an American
       military aircraft intruded in the air space of the German Democratic Republic. In spite of
       the <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0078"/>warning and of the order to land, the aircraft
       continued to fly deep into the GDR until it was shot down. The American side stated that this
       violation was unintentional, that this was not a military plane but a training plane which
       had lost its bearings.</p>
                        <p>It is difficult to agree that even a training plane could stray off course in such clear
       weather and over territory which is quite familiar to flying personnel. Nevertheless we took
       into account the statement made by your government that this was an accidental flight and
       that USA authorities are taking steps to prevent similar violations in the future.</p>
                        <p>But hardly six weeks had gone by and on March 10 there occurred a new violation of the
       frontiers of the German Democratic Republic. This violation was committed by a military
       aircraft, a reconnaissance-bomber equipped with air cameras as well as radio reconnaissance
       facilities which were in operation at the time of the flight. According to the official
       version, the RB–66 aircraft committed a navigational error and accidentally found itself over
       an area where something of interest to the American military command was taking place.</p>
                        <p>Can we fail to reach the conclusion, Mr. President, that the RB–66 intentionally violated
       the air space of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and did so in order to engage in air
       reconnaissance, if a film on which important military objects had been recorded was found in
       the wreckage of the plane and if throughout its flight, the crew knew exactly where it was
       and maintained two-way communication with its land bases?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, Secretary of State of the United States,
       told the Soviet Ambassador, in your name, that the United States of America regrets the
       occurrence, that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government is in no way involved in
       the intrusion of the RB–66 within the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and that you had
       given strict instructions not to allow such violations in the future. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> also said that a careful inquiry will be conducted and the
       culprits will be called to account. In view of these assurances, the Soviet Government and
       the Government of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> have found it possible to return
       the crew members of the intruding aircraft to the American authorities.</p>
                        <p>I believe that the flight of the RB–66 was arranged without instructions from the President
       of the United States of America. But I declare to you that I do not accept the idea that this
       was an accidental border violation. I will say more: soon after the January incident, we
       received information according to which the American command in Europe, intended to continue
       reconnaissance flights over <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> territory. It developed that
       we did not have to wait very long to receive confirmation of the accuracy of this
       information. Therefore, accepting your declaration that the Government of the United States
       did not order aircraft of the American military air forces to fly over the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> for <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0079"/>reconnaissance
       purposes, at the same time, I exclude the possibility that what has happened is the result of
       an error of the pilot.<note n="3" xml:id="d21fn3">After receiving the message from <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>
        glanced through it and responded, according to his memorandum of conversation, that
        “I felt absolutely certain that the Air Force could not be deliberately deceiving
        the President. I said that General Le May himself had investigated the matter and had
        assured us that this plane had orders not to go near the demarcation line. I said our
        preliminary investigation indicated that the plane had a faulty compass and that the crew
        had apparently carelessly not checked it.” (National Archives and Records

                        </p>
                        <p>It remains to assume that among the American military command in Germany there are people,
       and perhaps such people also exist within the military departments in Washington, who seek a
       worsening of the relations with the Soviet Union and who use, to that end, the very areas
       where the absence of settlement for many questions related to the defeat and the destruction
       of the German Reich during the Second World War, is felt more acutely, where there are
       greater possibilities for all sorts of collisions and conflicts, where American forces
       located in West Germany confront the Soviet forces stationed in the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>All this has prompted me to address myself to you and to express my concern that unless an
       end is put to the actions of those who provoke these incidents, our efforts to improve the
       relations between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the USA and to suppress
       everything that is a source of unnecessary complications and that maintains the Cold War
       climate, may prove to be vain efforts. It need not be said that the state of Soviet-American
       relations exerts a great influence upon the situation throughout the world. Relations between
       the Soviet Union and the United States of America will not be set completely right; we have
       only just begun to make real progress in the solution of the most important problems of our
       time. Can disarmament negotiations, for example, yield much result if instead of being
       accompanied by the day-to-day efforts of all parties striving to establish confidence, they
       are accompanied by sabre-rattling?</p>
                        <p>Then what is the result? American aircraft violate the borders of a Socialist state,
       authorities of the USA publicly protest against the defensive action of our military, and the
       American press launches a noisy anti-Soviet campaign. All this merely creates additional
       difficulties for the achievement of an understanding in those fields and on those problems
       where such an understanding now seems possible or favorable preconditions for it may be
       ripening. Apparently this is also the very intention of those who organize various incidents
       at one time on land and at another time in the air.</p>
                        <p>And it is not so much a matter of what material damage such incidents produce and even,
       perhaps, not in the incidents themselves as <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0080"/>such, as
       it is in their dangerous political consequences for the interests of our two countries, for
       the interests of the entire world. People hear statements concerning the aspirations of
       statesmen for peace and for improvement of the international situation. At the same time
       incidents occur one after another which indicate that the statements remain statements and
       tension continues. Can these really create an atmosphere necessary for arriving at a proper
       normalizing of the situation?</p>
                        <p>The problems which confront us must be solved in one way or another if we are to promote
       the cause of strengthening peace and eliminating the causes of disputes which may entail the
       outbreak of a thermonuclear war. We are convinced that it is in our general interest not to
       postpone the solution of these problems and, at least, in any case not to complicate their
       solution.</p>
                        <p>I have already mentioned that certain American military circles are organizing incidents in
       that very spot where there is a great deal of power, and this cannot fail to emphasize the
       timeliness and importance of a German peace settlement. If such questions as the
       normalization of the situation in West Berlin, the formalization of the existing borders of
       the German states, respect for the sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and
       other such questions were solved, then tension in this key spot for the fate of world peace
       would no doubt decline, which would be reflected most favorably in the international
       situation.</p>
                        <p>I shall not enumerate here all the specific problems requiring solution and requiring no
       little cooperation on our part. There is first of all the problem of universal and complete
       disarmament. Of course, it would not be proper not to note with satisfaction that a good
       beginning has already been made and that during the past year some success has been achieved
       even in regard to those questions the solution of which not so long ago appeared to be almost
       unattainable. But this, of course, is only the beginning.</p>
                        <p>The fundamental position of the Soviet Union is the improvement of Soviet-American
       relations and strengthening peace, and we would prefer, of course, not to engage in
       demonstrations of force, of hard firmness, and in the elimination of the consequences of
       incidents provoked by the acts of American military forces, but to concentrate, with you, our
       efforts toward guaranteeing for the peoples of our two countries a durable peace.</p>
                        <p>I should like to hope that you will consider with understanding these words of mine which
       are dictated by a sincere desire to avoid the unnecessary complications for the interests of
       our two countries.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Signing would bring both advantages and disadvantages to the United States.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The advantages would be:</p>
                        <p>1. Although insufficient of itself to produce a more forthcoming attitude by the Soviets on
       more important issues, signing would be an important psychological step in improved relations
       between the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>2. It would help to provide the Russians with an alternative to the Chinese hard line.
       Since any major multilateral agreements with the Soviets in the next year seem unlikely,
       bilateral agreements take on added importance.</p>
                        <p>3. More concretely, additional Russian tourists and other visitors should be able to come
       to America, it will be easier for United States travelers to visit the Soviet Union, and a
       significant expansion of professional contacts in the civil aviation field will
       ensue—all these represent important strengthening of our program to increase and
       improve communication.</p>
                        <p>4. There are a number of secondary advantages, such as familiarization with Soviet aviation
       techniques, improved courier service to the Embassy, modestly enhance Scandinavian bargaining
       position against the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on aviation matters.</p>
                        <p>5. Signing would be viewed by many of our friends as further reducing hostility, where
       failure to sign would reinforce the propaganda argument that we are implacably hostile to the
       Soviets.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The disadvantages would be:</p>
                        <p>1. Our efforts to restrict air contact with Cuba would be seriously impaired, and getting
       agreement of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Foreign Ministers to cut sea and air
       contacts between Cuba and all <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> states would be virtually
       precluded, if signed before the American nations act under an OAS <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0082"/>resolution. European countries will be encouraged to reinstitute air service to
       Cuba. In short, the precarious partial isolation of Cuba we have already obtained would be
       jeopardized.</p>
                        <p>2. Bloc airlines will almost surely gain entry for the first time to Latin America,
       particularly to Brazil and Mexico. This in turn would facilitate the movement of Cuban
       trained subversives and enhance Soviet bloc efforts and prestige within Latin America.</p>
                        <p>3. Our ability, limited in any case, to retard Communist aviation agreements for operations
       to other less developed countries would be reduced.</p>
                        <p>4. While there is a military risk from security aspects of possible emergency landings at
       United States military bases, this risk already exists to an extent, and can certainly be
       controlled.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Prompt signing could:</p>
                        <p>1. Let flights and tourist travel begin late this summer, rather than next year, and lay
       the ground for the other advantages.</p>
                        <p>2. But it would bring all the above disadvantages, and would involve Congressional and
       domestic opposition for following too closely on other measures increasing ties with
       Russia.</p>
                        <p>3. Chances of getting <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> action to stop air contact with
       Cuba would undoubtedly be lost.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Postponement of decision would:</p>
                        <p>1. Let us take full advantage of prospects of action by <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>
       members to cut air and sea contact with Cuba under any <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>
       resolutions.</p>
                        <p>2. Probably delay flights for a year.</p>
                        <p>3. Avoid having this agreement come too close on the heels of the other agreements with the
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, or the T39 and RB66 incidents.</p>
                        <p>4. Let us pick the best time to get maximum net psychological benefits from signing while
       minimizing the psychological benefits to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. Permit a balancing of the extent of remaining disadvantages with advantages to be
       obtained.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I recommend:</p>
                        <p>That the desirability of signature be assessed again once prospects for action under an
        <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> resolution have been exhausted.</p>

                        <p>I met with the President for approximately 50 minutes this morning from shortly after 11
       a.m. until nearly 12 noon. After a few exchanges about my activities since I had seen him on
       March 6<note n="2" xml:id="d23fn2">See <ref target="#d15">Document 15</ref>.</note> and
       during the picture-taking period I reported to him on my meeting with Senator
       Jackson's Subcommittee on National Security Staffing and Operations this morning,
       mentioning in particular the off-the-record exchange I had had with Senator Javits about
       anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union. I said I told the Senator that the recent meeting of
       Jewish societies in Washington and their subsequent meeting with the President and the
       Secretary of State<note n="3" xml:id="d23fn3">A memorandum of <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s conversation on April 7 with Lewis H. Weinstein, President of
        the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, is in the National
        Archives and Records Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59,
        Secretary's Memoranda of Conversation: Lot 65 D 330. The President's
        Daily Diary indicates that the President greeted a “Jewish Group” in
        the Fish Room at the White House at 5:45 p.m. on April 6, but no further information is
        provided. (Johnson Library)</note> were the kind of activities which, together with official
       efforts in the U.N. and maximum publication of the facts of the situation of the Jews in the
       Soviet Union, might influence the Soviet leadership toward alleviating the situation of the
       Jews there.</p>
                        <p>After the photographers had departed I expressed my relief at the Soviet decision during my
       absence to release the RB–66 flyers who were held in East Germany and my appreciation of the
       action the President had taken to prevent recurrences. This led the President to mention his
       own apprehensions about the possibility of incidents connected with the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> military maneuvers and air exercises in Iran. He thereupon
       called Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and among other things
       asked him to make sure that maximum precautions were taken to insure against any incursions
       into Soviet air space, and then called Mr. McGeorge Bundy to report his conversation with
       Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and to ask Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName>
                            <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0084"/>to follow through with the Defense and State
       Departments. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> came to the
       President's Office and participated in some further discussion on this matter.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently the conversation followed the general lines of our initial talk on March 6,
       particularly as respects Soviet attitudes toward relationships with the U.S. during the
       current period. When I reported that I was sure that Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would be looking for an early opportunity to meet with the President
       following the November elections, the President indicated his own view that such a meeting
       would be useful. In this connection we discussed <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s personality and possible matters which might come up in
       such a meeting, agreeing however that the agenda of such a meeting would depend upon
       developments meanwhile and the situation at such a time. The President indicated his
       understanding that a meeting with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would
       necessarily have to be coordinated with previous contacts with Allied leadership.</p>
                        <p>In discussing our current bilateral relationship with the Soviet Union I mentioned again
       the question of the Civil Air Agreement, saying that since our first conversation I had
       discussed this matter with the Secretary of State and others concerned, in particular
       Assistant Secretary Mann. I said that Mr. Mann had agreed that I report to the President that
       he would review his objections in the light of his current negotiations about Cuba and that
       he hoped to be able to reach a decision within the next couple of weeks which would allow him
       to withdraw his objections to the early signature and implementation of the Agreement. I
       again stressed my own view that the Russians regard this as a symbol of U.S. willingness to
       do business with them and pointed out also that the Soviet promise of improved communications
       facilities for the Embassy in Moscow was undoubtedly related in their mind to the question of
       the Air Agreement. I also reported to the President that I thought that we could expect to
       conclude negotiations for the Consular Convention within a matter of weeks after my return to
       Moscow. The President asked a number of questions in this connection including some about our
       expectations with respect to the subsequent reciprocal establishment of consulates. I
       described the nature of the Consular Convention and the expectation that after its conclusion
       we would ask for a consulate general in Leningrad while the Russians would probably ask for
       one in New York.</p>
                        <p>There was relatively little discussion of Cuba on this occasion but I did repeat my general
       view of the Soviet position on this question and said that I would keep very much in mind the
       President's concern about the Soviet presence there. The President asked a number
       of questions about the conflict between Moscow and Peiping to which I replied along the lines
       indicated in the memorandum of conversation on March <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0085"/>6. In this connection the President referred with some satisfaction to the reports of
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s remarks during his current
       visit to Hungary.</p>
                        <p>The President asked a number of questions about the economic situation in the Soviet Union
       and I reviewed Khrushchev's difficulties in this respect at some length along the
       lines reported by the Embassy, stressing that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had a problem of resource distribution which made his, the
       President's, problem in this respect seem relatively easy. The President expressed
       considerable interest in this phase of the conversation and the hope that means could be
       found to make the Soviet difficulties both in the international field and in their domestic
       economy better understood here at home.</p>
                        <p>While Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> was present and at the end of the
       conversation the President requested that I meet with the White House correspondents
       afterwards and give them as much of a rundown as I could on the nature of our conversation.
       Accordingly, after checking with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> and with
       the President's, Press Secretary, Mr. Reedy, I joined with the latter in his daily
       press briefing, made a general statement about my visit with the President and responded to
       questions for approximately 15 minutes.</p>

                        <p>The President made the following comments on the pen pal which you may wish to bear in mind
       in preparing an answer.<note n="2" xml:id="d24fn2">An answer to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s April 2 letter; <ref target="#d21">Document

                        </p>
                        <p>1. He believes that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> may well be
       suspicious of the RB–66 flight and is quite willing to respect this doubt as honest and to
       give it an honest answer, as full and complete as possible.</p>
                        <p>2. He would like to prove his own good faith by handing <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> exact copies of the orders which he caused to be sent out by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> after the RB–66 episode.</p>
                        <p>3. He would like to be quite firm in arguing that such an errant plane need not be shot
       down. It could be wig-wagged and signaled and warned in a variety of ways without such a
       hasty reaction, and the President thinks we might wish to wonder whether <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s own military people are not letting
       their own itchy fingers make trouble for him.</p>
                        <p>4. The President wishes to be quite firm that on the matter of the Berlin convoy arguments
       either <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is fooling us or his people are
       fooling him, since there was indeed a clear-cut Soviet effort to change procedure.</p>
                        <p>5. The President wishes to take the occasion to review with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> the position on the nuclear production cutback and to explain that he
       is getting to the point where he will wish to announce the new American decisions, probably
       on April 20.</p>
                        <p>6. The President asks if you think it would be wise to use this occasion to wish <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> a happy birthday, and to give the Ambassador an
       appropriate message in this talk, too.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">KHRUSHCHEV</persName> AT 70:</p>
                        <p>AN APPRAISAL OF HIS LEADERSHIP STYLE</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> arrives at his 70th birthday on 17 April
       with more than ten years' experience as leader of the Communist Party of the
       Soviet Union. During this period he has developed methods of operation, a certain style of
       rule, and a personal impact on policy which cannot easily be disregarded by those who
       eventually succeed him.</p>
                        <p>This week's occasion, like the later decennial birthdays of Stalin, calls for a
       gathering of the Communist clan and dutiful tributes not only to the man himself but also to
       Moscow's special place in the Communist world. It is, then, more than a personal
       anniversary; it becomes a natural landmark from which to assess Soviet policy as a whole.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately for <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, however, April 1964 is
       not the most propitious time for doing this. There is very little in the recent record which
       can be hailed as vindicating his policies and providing a special cause for celebration.</p>
                        <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0088"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Khrushchev the Leader</p>
                        <p>No matter how other Communist leaders may assess the situation, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> most certainly sees his setbacks and disappointments as only
       temporary discomfitures. In this respect he epitomizes the old-time Communist
       revolutionary—holding always to the idea that it is only the long-term prospect
       which really counts. And fortunately for <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
       personally, he enjoys a special status which can accommodate this unbounded optimism. His
       political primacy no longer depends upon his achieving a continuing string of policy
       successes.</p>
                        <p>For <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> at 70, the important
       thing—other than the maintenance of this special power position—is that
       he should be recognized as the very antithesis of Stalin, the one person who, while retaining
       the basic Communist framework, could bring the party back into full power, reform the secret
       police, reorient the economy and military services, and make the Soviet Union a first-rate
       world power.</p>
                        <p>Certainly by his own reckoning there are still good years left to continue this work, and
       to complete his programs for chemistry and agriculture and start any number of new major
       projects. Here again the natural <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> optimism
       comes into play, and it may have been boosted by the feeling that he is more fit today than
       he was two or three years ago. In any case, by external appearances, he retains most of his
       stamina and drive, and his temperament—to the extent it has changed at
       all—seems more even than in earlier years.</p>
                        <p>As part of the process of maintaining his special seniority, there has been a steady
       effort, both by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> personally and by the
       propaganda machine, to refine the image he projects on the public scene. The picture intended
       is a composite of world statesman, benevolent father figure, and man of the people, with all
       traces of the party ruffian neatly erased. As a result, he has been elevated to become one of
       the great military leaders of World War II and currently the great hope for peace in the
       world. The crudities are edited from his speeches, and he is even shown to be merciful to old
       enemies such as Voroshilov and Bulganin.</p>
                        <p>Despite these various efforts to popularize the man, there are very few indications that he
       is in fact a respected leader. Although he is frequently credited with raising living
       standards or harnessing the police, it is more often Malenkov who is considered the real
       liberalizer. Even to the party hierarchs, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
       is the “old man” who is both feared and distrusted. To the government
       bureaucracy, he often symbolizes the party agitator who forces through the temporary
       expedient in his quest for the short-term gain. To the proud army careerists he is the
       political commissar and military fraud. To many intellectuals he is an untutored tough. To
       the general public he is still essentially what is known in the Soviet Union as
       “one of them” — the bosses who impose themselves arbitrarily
       on the people from above.</p>
                        <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0089"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Uncertain Succession</p>
                        <p>In part it is because he maintains himself to a large degree by means of entrenched
       personal power that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is seemingly
       disinclined to face the problem of his own succession. Although he made gestures toward a
       settlement by singling out first Kirichenko and later Kozlov, there are hardly any
       indications at all that he provided them with the opportunities to develop their personal
       networks of operation. The big impediment has always been the fear of starting something
       which could eventually impinge on his own control. Then there is <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s ego and optimism, telling him that there is really no
       rush and that he can outdistance an Adenauer or anyone else for that matter.</p>
                        <p>Thus it was only a half-hearted move—reminiscent more of Stalin than anyone
       else—when <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> brought two of his
       closest followers, <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName>, somewhat to the fore last summer, not only so that
       they could be assessed better, but probably also to compete at the highest operating levels.
       Perhaps one of them will be invested as second secretary at the party congress next year, but
       he is unlikely under <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to enjoy any major
       independent political power.</p>
                        <p>Yet even if <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> decides to do nothing more
       about the succession, it is clear that he will leave behind him methods of operation and a
       certain style of rule which cannot be easily disregarded. He has brought the image of the
       leader out of the Kremlin and into the country and has made himself the continuing and almost
       sole spokesman on both foreign and domestic policy. He has fostered the impression that he is
       truly expert in his knowledge of practical problems and that he is actively engaged in
       improving the lot of the people. He has developed a system of rule which has succeeded in
       stabilizing the relative weights of the various power groups in Soviet society and he has
       been able to delegate day-to-day authority to free himself for long periods of rest,
       extensive trips abroad, and preoccupation with special problems when the need arises.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Foreign Policy</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s conduct of foreign policy
       through most of the period of his ascendancy has been marked by the same ebullient
       self-confidence, bold innovations, and flexibility that have characterized his domestic
       programs. His intention to impose a new style and direction on Soviet policy was symbolized
       at the 20th party congress in 1956 by attacks on the “ossified forms”
       of Molotov's diplomacy and by major ideological reformulations on the issues of
       war and revolution. These <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0090"/>themes were repeated at the
       22nd congress in October 1961, when <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> charged
       that Molotov and “his like” did not understand the changes that had
       occurred in world politics and <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> hailed the
       abandonment of “obsolete methods and ossified dogmas.”</p>
                        <p>While Soviet foreign policy under <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s guidance has displayed considerable versatility and
       resourcefulness in making pragmatic adjustments to the realities of the nuclear age, the
       Soviet premier's behavior since the spectacular failure of his Cuban missile
       venture has reflected a growing recognition that the wide-ranging political offensive against
       the West which was launched in 1957–58 has run its course without yielding the expected
       results. Events over the past three years, particularly the Cuban fiasco, have called into
       question the fundamental assumptions of this strategy—that time and long-term
       trends in the East-West contest were working to the advantage of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the socialist camp. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s adjustments to this situation have been symbolized by the
       limited test ban treaty last summer and the relaxation of pressures on Berlin and other
       exposed areas.</p>
                        <p>One of the most important factors that has shaped <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s foreign policy outlook has been his strong desire to
       gain world recognition of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s status as
       the great-power equal of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. This impulse has been evident
       in his dealings with American leaders and public figures and in the pleasure he finds in
       personal contacts with other non-Communist statesmen. [18 lines of 2-column source text not
       declassified]</p>
                        <p>Another characteristic of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
       foreign policy approach is great confidence in his ability to determine accurately the risks
       in any venture and to control the course of events in such a way as to maximize advantages
       and minimize the danger of losing control of a situation. Throughout his long Berlin
       offensive, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> frequently voiced confidence
       that the West would not go to war over a separate peace treaty with East Germany. He has
       tried to impress Western visitors by displaying detailed knowledge of the policies and
       intentions of his opponents as well as his own ability to manipulate developments without
       risking a military collision. Following the confrontation between Soviet and American tanks
       at the Berlin wall in October 1961, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> told
       the West German ambassador that he had issued clear instructions to Soviet forces in Berlin
       not to get involved directly with Western forces even though this might require retiring and
       requesting further instructions.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has relied heavily on bluff and
       intimidation tactics and on his technique of alternating deliberate creation of crises with
       proposals for high-level negotiations and hints of Soviet concessions. His long campaign to
       alter the status of West Berlin and achieve some form of Western recognition of East Germany
       has been based on a combination <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0091"/>of repeated pressures
       and inducements calculated to draw the West into negotiations under conditions favorable to
       the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has also shown a penchant for clever
       stratagems designed to entrap and confuse opponents and to increase pressures on them to
       grant concessions. His exploitation of the U–2 incident was intended to produce a storm of
       protests against <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy and to embarrass President
        <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> on the eve of the Paris summit conference.
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> confined his initial announcement of the
       shoot-down to bare details and then sat back to await the expected disavowal from Washington.
       After the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> issued the cover story of a missing <gloss target="#t_NASA1">NASA</gloss> research U–2, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> announced that he had withheld information that the pilot and
       aircraft were in Soviet hands, “because had we told everything at once, the
       Americans would have invented another version; just look how many silly things they have
       said.”</p>
                        <p>In February 1962, after the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> publicly announced detection
       of an underground nuclear explosion in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> declared that this test had been staged deliberately
       to disprove the West's contentions that on-site inspections were necessary to
       enforce a prohibition on all nuclear tests.</p>
                        <p>There is reason to believe that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has
       encouraged circulation of rumors abroad that his efforts to improve relations with the West
       were facing strong opposition within the top leadership. These hints of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s political vulnerability clearly were
       intended to persuade Western governments that some concessions were necessary to help
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> resist his domestic enemies.</p>
                        <p>The outcome of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s attempt to
       exploit the U–2 incident and to deploy missiles to Cuba point up his greatest weakness in the
       field of foreign policy—his vulnerability to self-deception and his ignorance or
       disregard of the mentality and reactions of his opponents.</p>
                        <p>In the case of the U–2, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
       miscalculation derived from his gamble that by absolving President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> of all personal responsibility for the U–2 flight,
       he could prevent events from getting out of hand and endangering the summit meeting and his
       “déétente” policy of that period. But the
       President's assumption of personal responsibility shattered this scheme and
       exposed <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to charges by Communist critics
       that he had been deceived and that his peaceful coexistence strategy had been proved a
       failure.</p>

       appears to have been the product of two main factors. His misreading of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> conduct of the Bay of Pigs operation in April 1961 and the shift
       in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy in Laos represented by acceptance of a coalition
       regime pledged to neutrality seems to have led him into the fatal error of underestimating
       American resolution. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> also allowed himself
       to believe that the high stakes <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64" facs="0092"/>involved in the
       missile venture justified a sharp reduction in the margin of safety which had characterized
       his previous major foreign decisions. The great advantages he anticipated from using the
       threat of Soviet missiles in Cuba to force a major diplomatic showdown on Berlin made
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> vulnerable to what one former Western
       ambassador in Moscow has described as “an incurable political shortsightedness
       which prevents him from foreseeing the remoter consequences of his words and
       actions.” (Secret)</p>

                        <p>The President began the conversation by stating he hoped Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> observed the fruits of the mutual efforts of our two
       Governments as reflected in the attitude of our peoples. He said he thought that Chairman
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, as well as President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
       and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>, deserved much credit for this
       development.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> disclaimed any credit, but he
       agreed that progress had been made. He said the Soviet Government had appreciated President
       Johnson's remarks to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>. He said
       that history had<pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0093"/> made our two countries responsible
       for much that went on in the world whether we wanted this or not. He said this power was
       personified in the persons of President Johnson and Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President said he was very much aware of the awesome responsibility of the Office of
       the President of the United States. He had been in office only a few weeks, but his chief
       concern was how could he benefit the generations to come. He said that if only we were all
       allies and friends, instead of having suspicions of each other, what a wonderful world it
       would be. He was trying to find ways to use our vast resources for the good of mankind. What
       he sought was for our peoples and our governments to feel as comfortable as he felt today in
       speaking to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. The President said
       that his father had often said to him that man's judgment on any given question
       was no better than his information on that question. He said that so many world leaders made
       judgments based on inadequate information. He referred to the agreement on the test ban, the
       agreement on prohibiting bombs in orbit, and the installation of the direct telephone line,
       which were but small drops, compared to what needed to be done.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said the question was how to
       proceed further. He said there were many problems, but the Soviet Union desired to improve
       relations with the United States. He said that speaking frankly, however, the Soviets
       sometimes felt that this was perhaps not the best year to make big progress, and said,
       frankly, he was thinking of our elections.</p>
                        <p>The President observed that this was, in fact, a problem. He said that when Chairman
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> spoke on television on the CBS network in
       1958, President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> had been indignant at the
       CBS for carrying the broadcast. He said that <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> felt that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was
       trying to propagandize our people. The President said he had told President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> that he thought this was a good thing, but there
       should have been an agreement for reciprocity so that each could have spoken to the
       other's people. The President said he called this the “Open
       Curtain” approach. He said that some day he would like Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to speak to the American people and have the
       American people speak on television to the Soviet people.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he had been head of
       the American section at the time the President referred to and that he had been very much
       involved in the preparations for President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>'s visit. He said that elaborate arrangements had been in
       preparation, but the unfortunate incident of the U–2 and other developments had made this
       impossible.</p>
                        <p>The President said that we had had other unfortunate incidents. We had had American planes
       shot down by Soviet planes. He said that he admitted that the Soviets were entitled to be
       provoked by the fact <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0094"/>that our planes had strayed over
       the line, but the remedy was not to murder people just as the Panamanians should not have
       shot our soldiers in the dispute over the flag. The President said he had given strict orders
       that our planes were not to take off unless our Air Force was certain that they would stay on
       our side of the line. He added, however, that there were occasions when communications broke
       down, and said that his own plane had been lost for this reason. He said the proper procedure
       would be to oblige any plane that strayed over to land and the crew could be captured and
       questioned. He said that if Soviet planes ever came over Oak Ridge or sensitive areas in the
       United States, we would be provoked, but he thought that the appropriate action would be to
       force the plane to land. The President said he had gone thoroughly into this matter, which he
       regretted, and was satisfied that the intrusion was not intentional. He said that he had
       pointed out to our military that the Russian instruments did not seem to go wrong, and that
       perhaps our Air Force should get Russian instruments. He said that he had been told, however,
       that Soviet planes did have similar problems on occasion.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said there were international
       rules to cover this problem and that planes should land when signalled. He said that the
       Soviet pilots had strict orders not to shoot unless the plane refused to land.</p>
                        <p>The President said that if any warning had been given, our pilots had not observed it, and
       it did not appear to have been adequate. He handed the Ambassador a letter to Chairman
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> on this subject.<note n="2" xml:id="d27fn2">
                                <ref target="#d28">Document 28</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The President then went on to say that he was speaking to the press next Monday<note n="3" xml:id="d27fn3">For text of the President's address on April 20 to the Associated
        Press, see Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>, 1963–1964, Book I, pp. 493–500.</note> and he wanted to say
       that he and Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had agreed to cut back
       on the production of fissionable material. The President said he would “catch
       it” from some of our own people, and pointed out that he was under pressure for
       more and bigger bombs. People would say that the Chairman had pulled wool over his eyes. The
       President cited a recent poll in North Dakota, which was a very conservative state. This poll
       indicated that eighty-one percent of our people approved our sale of wheat to the Soviet
       Union. This showed the progress which we had already made in improving relations. He said he
       hoped that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> could get an answer for him by
       Monday to his request to be able to say that Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was also cutting back on the production of fissionable material.</p>
                        <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0095"/>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then pointed out that he had
       just received Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s reply
       to the President's letter on this subject.<note n="4" xml:id="d27fn4">For text of

       only had the text in Russian, but, in brief, Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> agreed that he would stop construction of two plutonium reactors and
       that we would shut down the four old American reactors. On uranium, the Chairman would decide
       after he knew what moves were proposed by Britain and France. The Chairman agreed that we
       could exchange statements on this subject. He did not agree to the proposals about control
       which should be based on mutual trust, similar to the agreement prohibiting bombs in
       orbit.</p>
                        <p>The President emphasized that the best time for him to make this announcement was Monday,
       and he explained how important the editors to whom he would be talking were in relationship
       to what he was trying to do. He also referred to the reception in this country to his
       response to the Chairman's kind words about him when he had in turn welcomed Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s efforts for peace. He pointed
       out that the Washington Post carried a good headline, but the Chicago Tribune had headed its
       article “Johnson Embraces Nikita.” The President said he wondered what
       made the Soviets think that he could get a commitment from de Gaulle on this subject, but, in
       any event, he appreciated the compliment. The President instructed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> to work out the text of what he would say on this subject on Monday,
       and what he would like to say about Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s intentions in this field. He hoped that he could get a
       reply in time for his speech.</p>
                        <p>Emphasizing his concern for progress in the lowering of tensions, the President said that
       the Soviet Union and the United States had been too close to each other in Cuba, and
       Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> nodded his agreement. The
       President said that our guard was up and our hand out, that we would not be dupes but that we
       were ready for further steps.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked what further steps could
       be taken this year, and made a reference to the Chairman's proposal of a reduction
       of troops in Europe. The President did not comment directly on this proposal, but referred
       again to his proposal for an exchange of television speeches, and said to the Ambassador that
       as he, the President, had now made two good proposals, it was the turn of the Soviet
       Union.</p>
                        <p>While waiting for the photographers to arrive, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he had no instructions to raise the subject, but he wondered <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0096"/>what had happened by the Civil Air Agreement. He said
       that it had earlier been indicated that an agreement might be reached by the end of last
       year.</p>
                        <p>The President asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> how this
       matter stood.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> said we had deferred a decision
       on this subject until the conclusion of the Consular Agreement, which appeared to be
       near.</p>
                        <p>The President, at the end of the conversation, reiterated his birthday greetings to the
        Chairman,<note n="5" xml:id="d27fn5">The birthday message was transmitted in telegram 2997
        to Moscow, April 15. (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_SS1">S/S</gloss>-I Limdis/Exdis

       which he asked him to transmit to the Chairman.</p>
                        <p>After the meeting, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> and Ambassador
        <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> gave Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> the following language for inclusion in the President's
       speech, if Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> agreed:</p>
                        <p>“I have ordered a further reduction of our production of enriched uranium, fuel
       for nuclear weapons, by twenty-five percent over a four-year period. This reduction is in
       addition to the reductions which I announced in the production of both uranium and plutonium
       in my State of the Union message. And I am happy to say that Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has now indicated to me that he intends to make a
       move in this direction.”</p>
                        <p>Also after the meeting, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked
       Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> for further particulars about the
       proposed exchange of television talks.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> said that the President had not
       discussed this subject with him, but he assumed, from earlier consideration of this subject,
       that it would be important in the Soviet Union for the President's speech to be
       carried on radio as well as television since the Soviets did not have a nation-wide TV
       hookup. He said he also assumed that the text of the statements would probably be exchanged
       in advance and a date agreed upon. He said he felt sure the President did not wish in any way
       to embarrass Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> by making the suggestion
       if for any reason it was difficult for him to agree to such an exchange at this time, but
       pointed out that the suggestion was in line with the President's efforts to
       achieve better understanding as he had described them during their conversation this
       morning.</p>

        The President discussed the drafting of the letter in two brief telephone conversations with
        McGeorge Bundy on April 17, emphasizing that he wanted the letter to make clear that
        “the provocation did not justify the remedy.” Telling <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to quit “shooting down our
        planes,” Johnson stressed, was the “most important part of the
        letter.” (Recording of telephone conversations between the President and

                        <p>Dear Mr. Chairman:</p>
                        <p>I welcome your letter of April 2, 1964,<note n="2" xml:id="d28fn2">
                                <ref target="#d21">Document 21</ref>.</note> because of the spirit in which it was written.
       It is certainly incumbent upon both of us to do anything we can to strengthen our relations
       and to prevent incidents which could adversely affect those relations.</p>
                        <p>I found your letter particularly interesting because it seems to me it so clearly
       illustrates the ease with which misunderstandings can arise. You referred to the incidents on
       the autobahn which occurred last October. Our investigation showed that in the six months
       preceding these incidents, eighteen convoys with a configuration similar to those that were
       stopped were processed through your checkpoints without dismounting and without difficulty,
       except in the case of two which were delayed for short periods of time. It was, therefore,
       most natural for us to consider that it was your side that had changed procedures. But I am
       happy that this matter has now been resolved, and trust that there will be no further
       difficulties.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the airplane incidents, I can quite well understand your concern that
       within a short period of time two American airplanes crossed the demarcation line. There is
       little I can say about the incident involving a training plane, since the crew were killed
       and we are unable to ascertain what actually happened. I am disturbed that in both cases,
       however, there does not appear to have been justification for the rapidity with which there
       was a resort to force by Soviet planes. The American planes should not have been there, but I
       believe that this fast and violent reaction is quite unjustified. Avoidable acts of force
       which can bring death in peacetime do not contribute to an improvement of our relations. All
       of our pilots have long had rigid instructions that if by error they found themselves in East
       Germany, they should promptly obey signals to land.</p>
                        <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0098"/>
                        <p>The RB–66 was on a training flight from Toul Rosieres in France and was scheduled to pass
       over Hahn, Dortmund and Nordholz in Germany at high level, to descend to low altitude over
       Hamburg for a photographic exercise, and to return to high altitude on the return trip to its
       base. It is normal for planes on missions of this kind to test the cameras en route to see
       that they are in working order, but to use them only for the assigned mission. A thorough
       investigation has shown that the compass was faulty and that through a series of errors,
       adequate further checks of position were not made. Our Air Force has had procedures to
       prevent incidents of this kind, and when our radar station detected an unknown plane
       proceeding toward East Germany, the plane was ordered to turn back. The instructor navigator
       states he heard this instruction but says he thought that he was over Nordholz at the time
       and that the signal did not apply to him. Appropriate steps are being taken to deal with
       those responsible for the errors made.</p>
                        <p>From the debriefing of the crew, we can find no basis for the conclusion that
       “the crew knew exactly where it was.” I was particularly interested in
       your statement that you had received information, according to which the American command in
       Europe intended to continue reconnaissance flights over Eastern Germany. I should be glad to
       have any additional information bearing on this statement. From our own most thorough
       investigation, I am convinced that any suspicion that this violation was a deliberate
       provocation is unfounded. I recognize that this is an astonishing series of errors, and upon
       my instructions the American military authorities have established the most rigorous
       procedure possible in order to prevent any repetition of such an incident.</p>
                        <p>I think it most important that we deal with each other frankly in matters of this kind. I
       shall be glad to cooperate with you in reducing tension in this most sensitive area of the
       world. In this connection, may I tell you that I have been disturbed that the East German
       press has for some time been carrying on a campaign of accusations of alleged violations of
       traffic regulations by our military vehicles in East Berlin. After most careful
       investigation, it appears that, with rare exceptions relating to quite accidental episodes,
       these allegations have no basis in fact. I was, therefore, disturbed when your military
       authorities protested to ours on the basis of these allegations. For my part, I have given
       renewed instructions that our military vehicles take every precaution to avoid any incident
       in the future, and I hope that your own authorities will carefully investigate and establish,
       to your own satisfaction, whether or not East German allegations of this kind are
       well-founded.</p>

        21, it reported that a “damage assessment” was being taken to

        asked <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> to prepare an assessment for the period
        of his Ambassadorship. (Ibid.)</note> Reply to <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> re
       prejudice to national security through recently discovered microphone network must, in my
       opinion, be considered in at least three different categories:</p>
                        <p>1. Interception of Conversations.</p>
                        <p>A. Fortunately, secure rooms have been available during entire period of my incumbency.
       Consequently, I have invariably operated on assumption that conversations or oral exchanges
       outside these rooms and particularly in my own office were being overheard and/or recorded.
       In exchanges with staff and with American and foreign visitors or in press conferences I have
       refrained from any statements which I was not willing for Soviet side to overhear. Indeed, I
       have frequently made statements deliberately in the hope, if not expectation, that they <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0103"/>would be overheard. For example, as to what I thought
       would happen in the case of the shooting down of an American observer plane over Cuba.
       Exceptions to this practice have been in case of frequent consultations with my British,
       French and German colleagues which invariably take place in the secure rooms of my own or
       their embassies and less frequent conversations with selected colleagues or on sensitive
       subjects with a few others, notably the Canadian and Australian Ambassadors.</p>
                        <p>B. The same rule described in (A) has been applied by all members of the staff working on
       substantive or sensitive questions. I know of no significant slips or violations. However,
       our security officer is looking into this aspect in greater detail and will be reporting
       separately.</p>
                        <p>C. My own discussions on sensitive matters with staff members have been held in a secure
       room and the same rule has been applied with respect to conversations on such matters between
       staff members.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, the rule has been followed that all material to be enciphered and all other
       material of a classified nature must be dictated in one of the secure rooms or prepared in
       the form of handwritten drafts. Here too, I know of no slips or violations.</p>
                        <p>2. Compromise of Telegraphic Traffic.</p>
                        <p>A. If it is assumed that all outgoing and incoming telegraphic traffic has been known to
       the Soviet Govt then this would have been more seriously prejudicial to the national security
       in ways going beyond the compromise of codes and cryptographic techniques.</p>
                        <p>B. Even knowledge of telegraphic traffic, however, I do not believe would seriously have
       compromised any of the principal negotiations which have taken place since I arrived in Sept
       1962—notably the Cuban crisis, the Test Ban Agreement, the new Cultural Exchange
       Agreement and the Consular Convention. In most instances (except Cuba, handled semi-publicly)
       the basic position papers or negotiating positions were transmitted by courier. Outgoing
       telegraphic traffic consisted principally of factual reports of negotiating sessions, the
       substance of which was already known to the Soviet side. Incoming traffic was generally in
       the form of modified or fresh instructions which were the basis of communications to and
       discussions with the Soviet side within a short period after receipt. I have been unable to
       recall any specific occasion, however, when the Soviet side seemed to have been forewarned of
       a new position in advance and to have been able to prepare a counter which gave them a
       negotiating advantage.</p>
                        <p>C. The Soviets would have profited particularly from a knowledge of the considerable flow
       of information telegrams this Embassy receives, not only from the Dept but from other posts
       throughout the world, particularly those in critical areas, such as Germany, Laos. This <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0104"/>is very difficult to evaluate. I personally am somewhat
       skeptical as to whether Soviet officials have received this kind of information since I can
       recall no specific instance when Soviet officials seemed to be in possession of really
       accurate information coming unquestionably from American sources about our activities or
       intentions. The one occasion on which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
       alleged to have possession of specific info coming from our own communications was about my
       role in the wide diameter pipe embargo and this was clearly inaccurate, as I reported at the
       time. However, it is conceivable that there has been some flow of information which has
       influenced Soviet actions with respect to such critical problems as the situation in Berlin,
       harassments on the Autobahn and in air corridors, the situation in Laos, the situation in
       Cuba and their attitude toward the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. There is one type of conversation which takes place in the Embassy which may have
       facilitated KGB counter-intelligence operations. This would be discussions which have taken
       place from time to time between Emb officers and individual Americans, notably exchange
       students and professors, regarding the latter's personal problems and difficulties
       in the Soviet Union. Generally speaking, such conversations have not taken place in the
       secure areas and could have provided to the KGB material facilitating their exploitation of
       the individuals. This aspect will also be gone into in more detail by the
       Embassy's security officer.</p>

       Government. I went over with him steps being taken to review east-west trade by Executive
       Branch, Senate Foreign Relations Committee and private groups such as Chamber of Commerce. I
       then outlined problems arising from (a) lack of strong economic basis for substantial trade
       increases on bilateral basis between two economies which historically have not traded
       significantly with each other; (b) matters of trade practices such as patents, copyrights,

       interests. He doubted this but I got impression he was referring to tentative discussions
       with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> businessmen of exchange of steel plants for advanced
       chemical plants on which there probably would be a licensing problem.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The Soviet Union is still a land of paradox and nowhere does it show up more clearly than
       in the information and cultural fields. Although <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0106"/>I was
       able to engage in some remarkably frank and free exchanges with writers, artists, and even
       professional propagandists, the repressive hand of the bureaucracy (in my case, in the form
       of the Ministry of Culture) was never far away. On the same day, for example, I engaged in a
       free-swinging discussion of the Sino-Soviet rift with the leaders of Novosti, the
       “press service” which serves as an overseas propaganda organ of the
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and then was prevented by the Ministry of Culture
       from spending an innocuous evening with the editors of a music magazine watching the Red Army
       Chorus perform.</p>
                        <p>This paradox of today is still a vast improvement over the Stalinist orthodoxy of eight
       years ago. Since that time the U.S. Government has slowly expanded its information and
       cultural activities in the Soviet Union. The process has been, and still is, one of trial and
       error. The proper approach has been, and still is, one of pushing firmly but not
       belligerently on a number of doors marked “exchanges”,
       “cultural presentations”, “radio broadcasting”,
       “magazine distribution”, and the like. If the door doesn't
       open, return in a while and push again. If it does open, keep your foot in it and establish a
       program, no matter how meager.</p>
                        <p>Several years ago, our problem in the information and cultural field was the basic one of
       identifying the opinion leaders of the Soviet Union. Today, they have been identified and we
       are in contact with a number of them. The problem now has become one of maintaining and
       expanding those contacts.</p>
                        <p>If the present political climate prevails, the U.S. Government programs should be able to
       continue expanding at a gradual and unspectacular rate. Overoptimism and an excess of
       eagerness should be avoided. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has said
       there will be ideological coexistence and the bureaucracy that does his bidding clearly
       understands this. Nevertheless, the infrequent visitor and the American correspondent, in
       particular, are naturally attracted to the liberal elements of the society who are willing to
       talk more freely with them. This produces reactions and stories in the Western press that
       tend to overemphasize the magnitude of the liberal influence. They are there, they are of
       immense importance, but their position is still fragile. They are the potential enemies of
       Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and of the mysterious forces
       surrounding him and this fact is never forgotten. We must be extremely careful in courting
       them. To court the “unapproved” artists and writers too assiduously and
       to ignore the “approved” ones can set back the liberalization process.
       The brand of “pro-American” could prove disastrous to those whose
       courage and creativity we most admire. We must be careful to maintain our relationships with
       them but also careful to maintain our relationships with those whose work is approved by the
       Communist Party. The liberal elements understand the necessity of such a
       “balance” and welcome it. As Eugene Staples, our extraordinarily
       capable <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0107"/>chief Cultural Officer puts it, “We
       are still far from the day when we can safely predict even how many Soviet intellectuals will
       be brave enough to come to dinner, much less state with confidence that we will bring a given
       Soviet citizen or group into our sphere of activities.”</p>
                        <p>Present indications are that the creative artists have pretty well weathered the storm
       inflicted upon them in the winter and spring of 1963. For example, although Premier <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> himself described the sculptor Ernest Neizvestny as
       a “pederast” and his work in words of even fouler connotation,
       Neizvestny is still sculpting in the same ways and has even received an occasional official
       American visitor such as Jack Masey, head of <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>'s Graphic Arts Exhibit. For 48 hours, I had an on-again, off-again
       appointment with Neizvestny which was finally scrubbed. But it is significant that the
       Ministry of Culture found itself in an embarrassing and confusing quandary over whether to
       let an American “propagandist” visit the man whom <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had tried to humiliate a year earlier.</p>
                        <p>An interesting example of how the Soviet creator adjusts to his ambivalent position was
       provided by Mr. Efremov, director of the Contemporary Theater, who presents modern Soviet
       plays to sellout audiences. Efremov, who did come to dinner with me, spoke at some length on
       how he was able to open “Two for the Seesaw” a year ago at his theatre.
       Forced by the Ministry of Culture to get approval for all his plays, he slipped the
       “Two for a Seesaw” request to a sympathetic friend in the Ministry of
       Culture who approved it somehow without the top-level being consulted. When the play opened,
       to some very hostile reviews from the Party press, there was consternation. Still, the
       Ministry was afraid to close the play once it had opened. Finally, L.F. Iliychev, head of the
       Party's Ideological Commission, came to check it and apparently he approved
       because it was allowed to be shown to wildly enthusiastic audiences.</p>
                        <p>Reports from the Embassy and the press since my departure indicate that the position of the
       intellectual in Soviet society continues to change constantly. Iliychev had another session
       with writers and artists at which the latter apparently won some additional concessions.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Current Programs</p>
                        <p>The present U.S. Government program directed at these people is generally well-conceived.
       The heart of the matter is the exchanges program which is being better handled now that more
       Embassy staff time is being devoted to following up with the Russians who have returned from
       the United States.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, we should see to it that important Soviet exchanges, especially those in
       the literary and arts fields, are exposed to the people and institutions which we consider to
       be important to them. <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0108"/>In the cultural field, it seems
       to me, the principle of reciprocity—so important and sound in other areas of
       exchanges—need not be so insisted upon since it is just as much in our interest to
       expose Soviet intellectuals to the United States as it is to have Americans travel to the
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>I have the following comments on the three major programs for which we are fully
       responsible both here and in Moscow:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Voice of America</hi>. The <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> has
       been unjammed in the Soviet Union since June 19, 1963 for reasons still somewhat unclear to
       our Embassy. There is no question that the Voice is listened to by a wide and growing
       audience. There is now no opprobrium attached to listening. In scores of conversations, with
       students in Leningrad, with a female economist from Tomsk, with a young embittered Armenian
       in Tbilisi, with the talented film director A.A. Tarkovsky, with the leader of
       Moscow's new theater movement, Mr. Efremov, with the most hidebound bureaucrats,
       it was apparent that the Voice has become an important source of information. The news is
       most popular for <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> listeners as well as <gloss target="#t_BBC1">BBC</gloss> listeners. Jazz on <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> is next
       although I observed an interesting phenomenon here. Russian jazz fans, and this includes a
       great many of the young intellectuals, complain that <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>'s music programs are outdated and not up to the latest being played
       in New York's most far-out joints. For this they are turning to Radio Luxembourg.
       It would seem that the avid Russian fan, like his American counterpart, has a passion for
       being up with the very latest.</p>
                        <p>The main objections to <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> centered around charges of
       “propaganda” about the United States that were hard to believe. There
       was little complaint about distortions in programs related to life in the Soviet Union and
       the Communist world—a tribute to <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>'s
       effort to adhere as closely as possible to the known facts. The intelligent Soviet listeners
       that I spoke to struck me as shrewd judges of the objective-fact-filled program compared to
       the emotional super-charged program. <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>'s Russian
       programs, by all accounts, have improved notably in this direction in the past six months.
       However, there is much left to do under the new leadership in the Russian section of <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>. The lead taken by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>, a former head of <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>, and our staff in
       Moscow in providing a critique in depth of Russian programming has been of great value and
       must continue.</p>
                        <p>As the liberalization process hopefully continues in the Soviet Union, we will constantly
       have to be on our toes with <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> to keep it up to date. More
       access to the West calls for an increasing degree of sophistication to hold the listening
       audience.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The Exhibits Program</hi>. In effect, we have had a permanent exhibits
       program on location in the Soviet Union since 1961 when the first of five travelling exhibits
       opened in Kiev. The most recent show on the Graphic Arts in America has been a resounding and
       runaway <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0109"/>success, topping all the others. Over 1.5
       million Soviets saw this show in Alma Ata, Moscow, Yerevan, and Leningrad which is more than
       saw the other four shows combined. It was a happy combination of timing and circumstance. The
       subject matter of graphic arts fits in perfectly with the growing opportunity—and
       recent unsuccessful repression—for freer expression in painting. The hit of the
       show was a section containing a number of abstract works. Incomprehensible to many, derided
       by many others, the abstract work still opened up something totally new to Russian eyes and
       they were fascinated.</p>
                        <p>Each of the exhibits has been accompanied by a troupe of young American guides and these
       have provided the main pay-off for the U.S. Government. Russian-speaking and usually in their
       early twenties, they soon become proficient in ideological exchange. I believe their
       experience has largely gone unnoticed in the government. Few Americans have had a better
       opportunity to talk to the Russian people than the Exhibit guides.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Amerika Magazine</hi>. Amerika, currently at a level of 60,000 copies
       per month, is directed at the 8–10 million young Russians who are educated, intelligent and
       presumably have an interest in the outside world but no access to it. Some intellectuals I
       talked to were critical of it. They argued that when it was the only Western publication they
       had access to, it was fascinating. But now that they have some increased access to Western
       books and publications they feel Amerika is too slick and too shallow. They would like more
       poetry, more artistic criticism, more on the arts, and less “general
       Americana”.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the Ambassador points out correctly that we do not publish Amerika
       solely for the benefit of the intellectuals but also for those young and already established
       opinion leaders who have little or no access to things foreign.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Future Possibilities</p>
                        <p>These programs plus our cultural bulletin, (which is now mailed to 6,000 addressees), our
       English Teaching Newsletter, our Science Bulletin, our special mailings, the highly effective
       presentations (books and records primarily) program, and of course the all-important
       exchanges program must be continued and expanded where possible. In addition the following
       possibilities, prepared by Staples and our staff in Moscow and approved by IAS here, should
       be explored:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Reach Soviet Industrial Managers</hi>. There is an important and
       influential element of Soviet society devoting itself to the science of industrial
       management. We have much of interest that we can share with them in publications and
       exchanges. This is an area that is relatively untouched by our present programs and we should
       examine the possibilities that exist.</p>
                        <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0110"/>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Expansion of the English-teaching Program</hi>. The audience for
       English-teaching materials is unlimited in the Soviet Union. This applies to written
       materials, films, and TV shows. While there, I pressed Mr. Enver Mamedov, Deputy Chairman of
       the State Committee for Radio/TV to look at our extensive television materials on
       English-teaching. We should keep trying to open that door and other English-teaching doors
       because they lead to important new contacts and opportunities.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">More Direct Contact Work with Soviet and Communist
       Correspondents</hi>. To date we have been able to do very little in trying to place articles
       and photographs with Soviet and other Communist correspondents in Moscow. This may be a
       promising field and was mentioned—with a favorable response—in my
       conversations with D.F. Kraminov, the editor of Za Rubezhom.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Increased Scientific Information Work</hi>. So far, two copies of a
       new Science Bulletin have been mailed to a selected list in the Soviet Union. This should be
       continued and increased. Furthermore, there are apparently new opportunities for distribution
       of U.S. scientific material to Soviet science writers.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">More Work with Africans</hi>. Now that there is a new African
       specialist in the Embassy, work with this highly important group should be expanded. We
       should examine what materials we can supply the specialist from here for presentation to
       African diplomats and students.</p>
                        <p> Staples feels that, of necessity, the program in the Soviet Union has grown like Topsy. We
       are at a sufficient operating level now where we should attempt to survey the entire Soviet
       scene in cultural and information terms. As he puts it, “We should know this
       country well enough to be able to say with assurance that Rostov would be a good city for an
       industrial design exhibit in spite of the fact that the Soviets claim there is no exhibit
       space there—when we in fact know excellent space is available; that no one in
       Yalta has ever seen a copy of Amerika magazine in spite of the fact that according to the
       Soviet distributing agent 73 copies are sold there; or that Duke Ellington should be
       scheduled into Novosibirsk because our scientific exchangees tell us the Novosibirsk jazz
       club plays his arrangements.”</p>

                        <p>1. In accordance with the referenced memorandum, the Security Committee has completed a
       preliminary damage assessment of the audio-surveillance penetration of the U.S. Embassy,
       Moscow which is attached.<note n="3" xml:id="d35fn3">Not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Based on the technical assessments and inquiries conducted to date by the various
       departments and agencies, findings and conclusions are as follows:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">a. Findings</p>
                        <p>Complete Soviet control of the American Embassy in Moscow during the construction enabled
       the Soviets to install an elaborate and effective system of audio-surveillance penetration
       devices. [<hi rend="italic">9 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>Technical penetration would have furnished the Soviets foreign policy information involving
       direct U.S.-Soviet negotiations and matters of informational interests to the Embassy. In
       addition, the Soviets would have been able to acquire considerable data concerning the daily
       operations of the Embassy including the military attaché program and the external
       and internal political staffs.</p>

                        <p>A thorough and objective analysis of the findings to arrive at definite conclusions is most
       difficult since the opposition would not take any actions or counteractions which would be
       directly and obviously revealing of the success of technical penetration.</p>
                        <p>In the assessment of damage to the U.S. foreign policy interests,<note n="4" xml:id="d35fn4">See <ref target="#d47">Document 47</ref>.</note> the sum of the individual
       State Department assessments is that either the Soviet Government did not obtain the
       information assumed to be compromised or that the material did not reach the Soviet decision
       makers, or that the latter did not act on the information available to the U.S. detriment in
       ways observable by the U.S. In addition, while analysis of the telegraphic traffic for the
       period 1953–1964 has not detected any important damage to U.S. foreign policy interests, an
       area of uncertainty is necessarily left due to the lack of complete knowledge of Soviet
       decisions and actions.</p>
                        <p>In the damage assessment of areas outside the foreign policy interests, it must be assumed
       that the Soviets did compile a reservoir of knowledge concerning U.S. intelligence collection
       requirements within the framework of the attaché program, the success or failure
       in achieving its collection requirements and the modus operandi of the attaché
       program in Moscow. Presumably, extensive knowledge would also have been secured concerning
       all personnel of the Embassy, their personal habits and interests, their areas of official
       responsibilities, and the substance of their official viewpoints, attitudes and reporting.
       This reservoir of information can benefit the Soviets in their assessment of U.S. personnel,
       programs, operations and intelligence collection patterns.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>I received your verbal message of May 1<note n="2" xml:id="d36fn2">For text, see <ref target="frus1964-68v11#d26">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964–1968, vol. XI, Document 26</ref>.</note>
       even before my trip to the United Arab Republic.<note n="3" xml:id="d36fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> visited the United Arab Republic May
        9–25.</note> I have thought it over and I wish, in turn, to express a few thoughts.</p>
                        <p>First of all, I should like to assure you that I also am pleased with the measures taken
       simultaneously by us concerning the cut-back in the production of plutonium and uranium-235
       for military purposes. They have met with widespread approval throughout the world. After
       concluding the treaty banning nuclear weapon tests in the atmosphere, in outer space, and
       under water and reaching the understanding not to station in outer space any objects carrying
       nuclear weapons, this new step agreed upon between us constitutes, in effect, a third
       milestone on the way to ending the nuclear weapons race.</p>
                        <p>It is good that such a course is gradually becoming established in the relations between
       our countries, and in international relations in general, although, of course, we both know
       that the progress achieved along this line is still limited, on the whole, especially if it
       is compared with the vastness of the problem that confronts our countries and all mankind,
       that is, the elimination of the threat and the very possibility of a nuclear war.</p>
                        <p>As I learned from your message, you agree with our proposal that we now take a step forward
       in the field of cooperation between our countries in the peaceful uses <pb n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0114"/>of atomic energy, that is, in solving the problem of the
       desalinization of sea water. That is also a useful undertaking and, after receiving your
       reply, I immediately gave instructions to our appropriate organizations to start preparing
       for the forthcoming meeting with the American representatives.</p>
                        <p>You suggested that both sides issue a statement simultaneously concerning our mutual
       interest in solving the problem of the desalinization of sea water. That is acceptable to us.
       For our part, we are prepared to publish a statement by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> State Committee on the use of atomic energy concerning the understanding
       reached on the meeting of Soviet and American specialists for the joint study of scientific
       and technical questions relating to the desalinization of sea water by means of nuclear
       energy. If you have no objection, such a statement by us and a similar one from the American
       side could be published about a week after the transmittal of this communication by
       Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. As for the practical details of
       the preparations for the forthcoming meeting, including the time and place of the meeting, it
       will not be difficult to coordinate them through diplomatic channels.</p>
                        <p>We are, of course, pleased with whatever contributions have been made to the improvement of
       the international situation; this provides further assurance that cooperation between the
       Soviet Union and the United States of America in this matter is not an impossibility but
       quite within the realm of reality. In this connection, I liked your recent statement<note n="4" xml:id="d36fn4">Not further identified.</note> that you will henceforth try every path
       to peace, that you intend to keep moving forward and that, after all, the United States is
       not standing still. I can definitely assure you that we, for our part, will be equally
       dynamic and equally flexible in searching out ways to promote peace.</p>
                        <p>Actually, when in my previous communication I alluded to the question of reducing the
       number of foreign troops in Europe as one on which it would be worth having an exchange of
       views, what I precisely had in mind was whether we could not seek to find some way to reach a
       mutual understanding on the question of strengthening peace in this area. Hardly anyone would
       dispute the fact that the military confrontation between the USA and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in Europe is one of the fundamental sources of international
       tension. We did not, and do not, want this confrontation. As long as John and Ivan, gripping
       sub-machine guns, are tensely eyeing one another across the boundary between the two German
       states, the situation will remain dangerous, regardless of what anyone says. After all, they
       are both backed up by weapons of maximum destructiveness. In no other part of the world are
       our soldiers standing directly opposite one another; isn't that in itself
       something positive?</p>
                        <p>Therefore, even if, for whatever reasons, we both cannot send our soldiers home
       immediately, it would be natural for us to reduce—at least gradually-the level of
       the Soviet-American armed confrontation in this area.</p>
                        <p>You express doubt as to the possibility of progress on the question of the reduction of
       foreign troops in Europe under existing conditions. You indicate that, in order to achieve a
       substantial reduction of the US <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0115"/>troops in Germany,
       changes must occur in the situation which would afford the Germans and the other Western
       Europeans some other way of feeling secure. It is hardly advisable to enter into a dispute
       now on the question of what constitutes a threat to the security of the European countries.
       Our views on this point obviously differ from yours. But if you consider that it would be
       difficult for the United States, under present conditions, to reduce its forces in Europe,
       perhaps it would be easier for the USA if we took the first step in this direction. I can
       tell you that the Soviet Government intends very shortly to reduce by 15,000 persons its
       permanent contingents stationed outside the Soviet borders in Europe.</p>
                        <p>It would be good if you could take a counter step in the same direction, carrying out a
       similar reduction of your permanent troops in Europe. Here we do not insist on the principle
       of a precise correlation of our moves in time, nor do we insist that both sides apply the
       same quantitative measures-on a “soldier for soldier” formula. If we
       follow a policy of mutual example in this case, it will be possible to reach a number of
       flexible decisions.<note n="5" xml:id="d36fn5">
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> raised the issue of reducing forces in
        Europe during a conversation with <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> on June 8.
        According to <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s memorandum of the
        conversation the following exchange ensued: “I said we had already done so.
        ‘Why don't you do the same thing?’ I pointed out we had
        withdrawn some 10,000. He corrected me, ‘only 7,500,’ and suggested
        that wasn't enough to be meaningful.” (National Archives and Records
        Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 17 <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>In your message you mention the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> proposals submitted at
       the Geneva conference on disarmament. I am acquainted with these proposals, just as you
       yourself are of course acquainted with ours. I do not think there is any need at present to
       enter into details, but if it is a question of the whole gamut of disarmament proposals, then
       we surely have before us an unlimited field for serious work on the finding of ways to
       achieve agreements. The Soviet Government has made, and is making, considerable efforts to
       plow this field and to grow a good crop on it. However, to be perfectly frank, we do not have
       the feeling that the other party is acting along the same lines. The fact is that there has
       not yet been any progress in the Geneva negotiations, and the state of the disarmament
       problem naturally leaves us with a strong feeling of disappointment.</p>
                        <p>Now you are in favor of our representatives, who are dealing with disarmament problems,
       being instructed to make a really persistent effort to reach agreement in this important
       area. Why not? Let them work a little longer, and a little harder; we have to explore every
       possibility to the end, that is my feeling. We shall give our representative in the Committee
       of 18 the necessary instructions. And to increase the chances of success, to ensure that the
       disarmament negotiations do not sink <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0116"/>again into
       routine, let us both follow the work of our representatives more closely; let us prod them a
       little if that is needed. As you will obviously remember, as early as 1962, before the
       beginning of the work of the Committee of 18, the heads of states and the member-governments
       of the Committee agreed to take a personal interest in the course of the negotiations. That
       was a sensible decision.</p>
                        <p>I am thinking that sometime soon it might be useful to instruct our ministers of foreign
       affairs to examine the course of the negotiations. They could do this, for example, during
       the XIX Session of the General Assembly of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. They will
       of course have other matters to discuss. Let us see what concrete results can be achieved by
       our ministers. And then, perhaps, the need will arise for us to meet. We understand that
       similar views are current in Washington also. But this is, of course, a matter for the
       future. We should not run too far ahead.</p>
                        <p>When you state that we must strive to adjust our differences in all fields with due
       consideration for the interests of others, we understand. We must do everything possible to
       reinforce, and develop further, the progress made in relaxing international tension and in
       increasing trust. I cannot [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] [cannot help but]<note n="6" xml:id="d36fn6">All brackets in the source text.</note> note in this connection the great
       importance of eliminating such a source of complications as the continuing encroachments on
       the sovereignty and security of the Republic of Cuba. You know our point of view on this
       question. It remains unchanged, but I allude to it once again because precisely in recent
       weeks the provocations against Cuba have been intensified, and this can only make the
       situation even more dangerous.</p>
                        <p>The pirate raids on the territory of the Republic of Cuba, the landing of diversionists and
       weapons, the demonstrative statements of Cuban counter-revolutionary emigrés on
       the preparations for a military attack on Cuba-all this aggravates the situation and compels
       the whole world to keep a watchful eye on the development of events in the Caribbean Sea, and
       to wonder what is going to happen there next. The American Government has on several
       occasions explained that it does not encourage this activity by Cuban emigrés and
       that it does not make <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> territory available for such
       activity. But then, one may ask, where is all this coming from?</p>
                        <p>One cannot help thinking that this new outburst of hostile activity on the part of Cuban
       emigrés coincides in time with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
       Government's statement of its intention to continue the intrusions of American
       airplanes into the airspace over the Republic of Cuba for intelligence purposes.<note n="7" xml:id="d36fn7">For text of President Johnson's statement on April 21 about

       fail to emphasize that our position is the same as outlined in our message. It is important
       that all parties be quite clear on this matter.</p>
                        <p>I know and feel that it is not very agreeable for you when I talk about all this. Believe
       me that it gives me no pleasure; but concern for the preservation and strengthening of peace
       compels me to call things by their proper names. Peace is equally necessary to us all. This
       means that sources of tension have to be eliminated and that the situation in potentially
       dangerous areas has to be normalized. This must be done everywhere where danger
       exists-including the Laos-South Viet-Nam-Cambodia areas where the threat is now arising of a
       collapse of the peace system created by the Geneva Agreements of 1954 and 1962.<note n="8" xml:id="d36fn8">For text of the July 20, 1954 agreement, see <ref target="frus1952-54v16">

       interests in this area, and that we only want the peoples of these countries to live as they
       themselves want, without any outside interference. Unfortunately the United States of
       America, in this matter also, pursues entirely different aims. This is what complicates the
       whole picture and pushes events in a dangerous direction.</p>
                        <p>I repeat, it is imperative that sources of tension be eliminated. This is what comes to
       mind every time you try to picture to yourself the future course of events in the world.
       There is much to be done in the strengthening of peace, and we have to increase our efforts
       in order to achieve more tangible results.</p>
                        <p>Let me raise one more question. You note in your communication that nothing could be of
       more benefit for the cause of peace in the world than a proper settlement of the German
       problem, and you state that the United States is prepared for any settlement of the German
       problem that would satisfy the legitimate interests of the German people and of other
       interested peoples, including the Soviet people.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, there you hit upon the fundamental question. We consider the German question
       fundamental because it is the source of all existing tension and dangerous developments in
       the world. Why the German question? Because the lack of a solution of this question compels
       both you and ourselves to concentrate the armed forces of one side against the other. If this
       German question were solved, there would then be no need for you or for us to put out such an
       enormous quantity of troops and of weapons; there would not be, so to speak, the great
       confrontation of John and Ivan.</p>

                        <p>This question may and should be solved-so that the people of the whole world could breathe
       more easily and, when they go to bed at night, would not be afraid that a war would break out
       the next day and that they would never get up again. If matters proceed further in their
       present direction, the threat of war will increase, and there will be no end to this
       dangerous development. Meanwhile, every statesman bearing responsibility for the preservation
       of peace can easily see the danger of the existing situation, and, consequently, draw the
       correct conclusions.</p>
                        <p>The armies of the Soviet Union and the USA fought together against Hitler's
       Germany and scored a victory. This was a triumph not only for the peoples who were fighting
       against Hitler's Germany, it was a triumph for all the peoples of the world. Of
       course, the Soviet Union and the United States of America, supporters of socialism and
       capitalism, adopted different approaches to the question of how events should develop after
       the collapse of Germany, and along which lines the German state system should develop.</p>
                        <p>Let us be frank. Both Roosevelt, and Truman after him, believed that since Germany was a
       capitalist country, a country of monopolies, it should remain one even after its collapse-the
       only difference being that the people who ruled Germany earlier should be replaced.
       I'll go even further; some people who supported the capitalist system tied their
       hopes to its preservation in Germany on the assumption that other countries, weakened and
       bled white by the war, with disrupted economies, would also follow the same road. But
       history, as is well known, has decreed otherwise.</p>
                        <p>I will not hide the fact that we, being Communists, hoped of course that the development of
       Germany, of the entire German state, would go in a better direction. And a better direction,
       to our way of thinking, is the movement toward socialism.</p>
                        <p>Each side had the right to judge for itself and to nourish its own hopes.</p>
                        <p>Nineteen years have elapsed. Neither you nor we need any longer rack our brains as to the
       direction in which the German regime is developing. Now we simply take note of the facts, of
       the situation which obtains. In the place of the former German Reich two independent German
       states have been formed, not only with different but with frankly conflicting socio-economic
       systems. Western Germany (<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>) has become economically
       strong, is militaristically inclined, and increasingly reveals itself as a state with
       aggressive and revanchist aspirations; it openly demands revision of the results of World War
       II, it attempts in every way to counteract the relaxation of international tension and the
       creation of firm bases for peace in Europe. Alongside the Federal Republic of Germany another
       German state has become established and <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0119"/>is developing
       successfully, the German Democratic Republic. I stress the fact that it is developing
       successfully and I feel it necessary to stress it-so that there will be absolutely no
       illusions with respect to the German Democratic Republic, so that no one will mistake the
       wish for reality. And the realities must be evaluated correctly: The <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> is developing as a peace-loving socialist country and is eminently successful
       in its development.</p>
                        <p>If all countries bearing responsibility for the peaceful democratic development of Germany
       acted courageously and discarded unreal and illusory hopes, if they took a sober look at the
       present situation and correctly assessed future prospects, then in the name of the future and
       to prevent a catastrophe more terrible than that unleashed by Hitler and his regime, they
       would sign a German peace treaty.</p>
                        <p>The signing of a peace treaty would harm no one. None of the parties would lose anything it
       has today. It is true that the West German revanchists claim that they would lose the German
       Democratic Republic, but after all you cannot lose what you don't have. And if
       another hundred years elapses, and even if the capitalist system continues to exist, they
       still will not get what they want. Such is reality whether Bonn likes it or not.</p>
                        <p>Speaking frankly, the prospect of reunification of Germany into one state does not please
       the ruling circles of Great Britain, of France, or of the United States of America. And if
       they nevertheless support for the time being the position of the revanchist forces of West
       Germany, this is only as a result of the tension which has arisen-primarily between our two
       countries. They support the revanchists in the hope of obtaining victory in the cold war, of
       seeing the triumph of their “positions of strength” policy, as it was
       formulated by Dulles and Adenauer. Right now, the Western powers have their money on West
       Germany. They support its dangerous revanchist plans, urge it to arm, and recently they have
       propounded the idea of creating the so-called <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
       multilateral nuclear force-through which they intend to supply the West German Bundeswehr
       with atomic weapons.</p>
                        <p>All this is done to gratify the West German revanchists and militarists, and it does not
       reduce tension, but, on the contrary, intensifies it. However, if we want to avoid
       catastrophe (and no one is immune as long as the question of the German peace treaty is not
       settled; it can break over people's heads quite unexpectedly), then sooner or
       later national leaders will have to muster up courage and soberly assess the existing
       situation.</p>
                        <p>What kind of courage is required? I would say great courage and at the same time not so
       great. Great courage from the viewpoint of understanding the responsibility we bear for
       preserving peace on earth, and not too great in that we are actually talking about giving
       form to <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0120"/>a situation that already exists. This would
       not entail sacrifices or losses for either side. On the contrary, both parties would gain
       from it and the greatest gain would be for the cause of peace-from reducing the armed forces,
       relieving the peoples of the heavy burden of the armaments race, and from the relaxation of
       tension. This would be a boon for the whole world.</p>
                        <p>The most important element in the German question is already decided, in effect, but has
       not yet been given proper form by those who should have done so. Even such a zealous
       proponent of a “position of strength” policy as Adenauer recognized
       that the German issue cannot be settled by military means. And even though this is clear to
       all, the West continues to pursue an arms race policy, builds up its armed forces, and
       carries out other military preparations.</p>
                        <p>But one is, after all, in conflict with the other, and this contradiction contains the
       basic danger, since ultimately it could well lead to such tension as to unleash a
       catastrophe.</p>
                        <p>At present, opinion throughout the world is virtually unanimous on this important question;
       namely, that the German issue cannot be resolved by liquidation of the German Democratic
       Republic, its absorption by West Germany and the creation of a single German capitalist
       state. This is impossible. We are against it. If there still exist people who pursue such
       aims, they are adventurists. They conceal their aggressive revanchist aspirations under the
       pious slogan of the extension to all nations of the right to self-determination, although
       they understand perfectly well that the principle of self-determination is not applicable to
       the German question and has absolutely nothing to do with the unification of Germany.</p>
                        <p>Two German states exist upon German territory. This is true. However, the division of
       Germany took place not along national but along social lines, and the differences between the
        <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> are not
       national but derive from the socio-economic structures of the countries. This is the decisive
       factor. There is no force capable of making the workers of the German Democratic Republic
       renounce their socialist achievements and enter the Federal Republic of Germany where
       capitalism prevails and the workers are exploited, where the prevailing system represents
       everything against which the adherents of socialism have been fighting.</p>
                        <p>The fact that mankind is moving toward socialism is recognized now not only by Communists,
       but by most of the countries of the world. After all, nearly all the countries which today
       are freeing themselves from colonial enslavement declare their determination to build their
       lives on a socialist basis. The ideas of socialism have become so popular in the world that
       even some rather well known leaders in the USA have suggested that some different name be
       found for capitalism, since <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0121"/>capitalism has become
       synonymous with imperialism, colonialism, and the oppression of peoples.</p>
                        <p>How can one seriously expect that the German Democratic Republic, having tasted the sweets
       of free labor would voluntarily reject the socialist order? This is an illusion, the illusion
       of people who with every fiber of their being, hate what is new, what is socialist, what is
       not capitalist, and who continue to look at the world of today with the eyes of the past,
       maintaining stubbornly that only one system, the capitalist one, has the right to prevail in
       the world. These illusions have long since been cast out by the peoples of Russia and cast
       out for good. The remarkable achievements of the Soviet Union in the economic, political,
       social, cultural, and scientific fields are known to the whole world. Other countries have
       set out on the road to socialism and have already made great strides.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, I hope my remarks will be taken in the right spirit. If we recognize that
       the German question cannot be settled through force, through war, that the people of the
       German Democratic Republic cannot be persuaded to renounce socialism-that they will not
       do-then there remains only one way out; to allow history to take its course and for us to
       sign a German peace treaty and thus wrap up the Second World War.</p>
                        <p>The peace treaty would in no way bar the road to unification for the Germans. On the
       contrary, in our view the treaty should provide for the possibility of unification of both
       German states on the basis of mutual agreement. And until there is such an agreement, the
        <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> could
       gradually establish and develop contacts in the fields of trade, culture, etc., in order to
       multiply the ties between the German states. The German Democratic Republic, through its head
       of state, Walter Ulbricht, long ago advanced the idea of a German confederation, the
       existence of which would have been a good foundation for cooperation and for the gradual
       rapprochement of the two German states.</p>
                        <p>On our side, as participants in the anti-Hitler coalition of World War II, we could write
       in the peace treaty that we shall further the efforts of both German states to create a
       single peace-loving, democratic German state through mutual agreement, and this would be in
       line with the fundamental principles of the Four-Power Potsdam Agreement, which were aimed
       against the resurrection of German militarism and Nazism.</p>
                        <p>In any event, the peaceful settlement of the German question must be carried out in a
       practical manner; ways toward a solution must be sought. Is there a possibility that such a
       search might succeed? I believe that there is. After all, only 2–21/2 years ago a certain
       rapprochement of positions was achieved on such key problems of the German peace settlement
       as: the German borders, the question of arming the <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0122"/>Germans with nuclear weapons, respect for the sovereignty of the countries which have been
       formed on German soil, the development of a new status for West Berlin which will be both
       more stable and-if you will allow me-more timely than the present one, and access to West
       Berlin. Not all the difficulties were overcome at that time, but a certain basis for further
       progress was nevertheless established.</p>
                        <p>Has the time not come, or at any rate is it not growing nearer, to return to these
       questions, to take a new look at existing differences of opinion, taking into account the
       progress achieved since then in the relation of international tension, in the strengthening
       of international confidence? It is quite obvious that if we postpone for long the settlement
       of German affairs, this can only render the situation more dangerous.</p>
                        <p>These are the thoughts and the reflections which come to me, Mr. President, after thinking
       over your verbal communication of May 1 of this year. I have endeavored to set forth my
       thoughts in a frank manner, bearing in mind the fact that our dialogue should enable us to
       understand one another better and should lead to further constructive results in the
       interests of our peoples, in the interests of peace in the entire world.</p>

                        <p>The Attorney General called me today to give me an account of a luncheon which he had with
       Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. He reported that the Ambassador

       that there would be some Soviet participation in the Oral History project.<note n="2" xml:id="d38fn2">A copy of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s

        history project) and promised to send Soviet documents and other materials pertaining to
         <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s foreign policy. (National

        Embassy delivered newsreels, tapes, photographs, and newspaper clippings for deposit in the
         <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> Library. (Memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_ORI1">Owen</persName> to Davies, August 25; ibid.)</note> He reported that the
       Ambassador's questions turned mainly on the degree of continuity between the
        <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and the Johnson Administrations. Did
       President Johnson share President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s
       objectives? (<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s letter was very
       warm in its praise of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>.) The Attorney
       General said he had tried to set the Ambassador's mind at ease on this point.</p>
                        <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0124"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he understood how hard it was to make any further progress now, but he
       did think perhaps we could sign the air agreement which had already been initialled. I told
       the Attorney General that we were holding up on this because of a tactical concern lest such
       signature complicate our efforts to intensify the isolation of Cuba at the forthcoming <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> meeting. He expressed understanding and we agreed that he could
       not make this explanation to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had expressed his concern about the Chinese,
       who wanted a war in which other societies would be destroyed, while there would be 200
       million Chinese left. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that this was
       building a civilization on a graveyard and the Poles and Russians had asked where such a
       policy would leave them. But the Chinese had not given any ground. Mao was now becoming a
       god, like Stalin at the end. People were required to bow down toward Mao and to memorize his
       teachings. Yet the Ambassador hoped that the situation in Laos would work out all right, and
       he asked where American policy was heading in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General had answered that American policy in Vietnam was following a course
       laid out and followed by <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, and Johnson, one after the other. It was a policy
       based on both principle and prestige. In response to the Ambassador's question,
       the Attorney General said that the U.S. did not wish to expand the war. But if it were faced
       by a choice between expansion northward as against defeat and withdrawal, the U.S. would take
       the former course.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador had spoken of the dangers of nuclear proliferation and said the Soviet Union
       was ready to sign an agreement right now if only the United States would give up the MLF. He
       believed the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would not help, and we should reconsider our
       commitment to it.</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General asked him what would happen if the Chinese tested a nuclear weapon.
       The Ambassador's answer was that the test would be only the first step toward a
       real delivery system. The Chinese economy was in bad shape and the Ambassador indicated no
       immediate concern about this danger. The Attorney General then reported to me that he had
       heard from a reportedly reliable journalist of the <hi rend="italic">London Observer</hi>
       that Tito in Poland had said that the Soviets were determined not to permit the development
       of a Chinese nuclear weapon. (This is a separate matter which the Attorney General did not
       discuss with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>.)</p>
                        <p>All in all, the Attorney General reported that the conversation was friendly and
       straightforward, and that he found Dobrynin understanding in his acceptance of the fact the

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> came in at his own request today
       to have an informal talk before his return to the Soviet Union for consultation and holiday.
       The Ambassador was in his usual cheerful frame of mind, and the conversation was not of great
       moment. The principal point which he made on his side was that he supposed nothing much would
       happen in the coming months because of our election. I said that with respect to larger
       initiatives this might be correct, but that we should press forward our discussions in Geneva
       and that in our view it was important also to make progress in Laos, as I was sure he knew
       from his conversations with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I took advantage of the occasion to tell the Ambassador that he should not suppose that the
       campaign would make any difference in the main thrust of American policy. We would continue
       in the search for peace, just as we would also continue to hold up our end in issues where we
       had differences with the Soviet Union. I warned the Ambassador against any Soviet
       intervention in our election campaign, and the Ambassador indicated his understanding.<note n="2" xml:id="d39fn2">In his memoir, <hi rend="italic">In Confidence</hi>, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> recalls a meeting with <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> on July 12, but it is apparently the same meeting. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> notes, among other things, that <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> warned him “Johnson might have to say some
        things [during the campaign] that might displease Moscow,” but that <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> also “hinted that the Johnson camp would not
        mind if the Soviet side, too, sometimes criticized Johnson, although he requested it to be
        kept ‘within reasonable limits.’” (p. 122)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to Southeast Asia the Ambassador pressed me specifically on the question of
       the Cambodian border and our reluctance to engage in 14-nation discussions of this
        question.<note n="3" xml:id="d39fn3">The Cambodian border issue is documented in <ref target="frus1964-68v27">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964–1968, volume XXVII</ref>.</note> I told him
       that we were at least as interested as his government in stabilizing Cambodia's
       borders, but that we were not encouraged by the reaction of some of the friends of the Soviet
       Union to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> efforts in this direction. I said further that
       it was unreasonable to suppose that we should side with Cambodia against her neighbors on the
       ways and means of moving toward such stabilization. The Ambassador in effect suggested that
       we should give Sihanouk more of the benefit of the doubt.</p>
                        <p>The conversation touched briefly on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, and I pressed
       upon the Ambassador that it was not <pb n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0126"/>a matter of <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> or no <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, but rather a matter
       of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> or an opening for men like Strauss, possibly in
       collaboration with de Gaulle. I told the Ambassador that if all of Europe were willing to
       leave the entire nuclear responsibility with the U.S., we would have no problem, and there
       would be no need for an <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. But this was emphatically not
       the case, and in any event the Ambassador should remember that the question was created by
       the very heavy concentration of Soviet rockets aimed at Western Europe. The Ambassador then
       remarked that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> was really not very important in
       military terms, and I said that if this were the case I was surprised at the strength of
       Soviet opposition to it. The Ambassador repeated again that the question was one of the role
       of the Germans, and I repeated that it was a question of having the Germans in and safe, or
       out and dangerous. The Ambassador said nothing, but it is my strong impression that he
       himself understands and respects this argument.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador explained at length the Soviet view of Drew Pearson's request for
       permission to publish his interview with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, a
       matter which I have reported separately.<note n="4" xml:id="d39fn4">In a memorandum to the

                        <p>Mr. David Rockefeller came to the Department for discussions pertinent to his pending visit
       to the U.S.S.R. as one of a group of prominent private Americans who will have informal talks
       on current problems of mutual interest with a comparable group of Soviet intellectuals and
       public figures. Following the unofficial conference in Leningrad, July 26–31, it appears
       likely that Mr. Rockefeller will be granted an audience with Premier <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Much of the conversation during Mr. Rockefeller's courtesy call on the Secretary
       concerned the possibilities for increased U.S.-Soviet trade and the related credit and other
       problems which make any substantial increase unlikely in the foreseeable future. The
       Secretary said that the Russians could be told that both in and outside of Government we are
       looking very seriously into the matter of increased bilateral trade. However, there is a wide
       variety of problems which suggest that any major increase is doubtful. He observed that the
       economic bases of our two economies are so much alike that neither has a ready market for a
       large range of commodities produced by the other. Furthermore, there are problems of
       financing, differing trade practices and also legislative problems.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that despite such difficulties we have been seeking ways to facilitate
       some increase in U.S.-Soviet trade. For example, we recently have granted an increasing
       number of licenses for specific exports to the U.S.S.R.; also we have not raised barriers to
       U.S. tourism there, thus providing exchange usable in trade. Essentially, we are interested
       in increased trade and quite prepared to take some steps in specific instances, but cannot
       give cause for hope of any major increase.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rockefeller wondered whether he should ask the Soviets if, in return for increased
       trade, they might be willing to take a more favorable position on other issues outstanding
       between the two countries. For example shouldn't we have a right to ask they cut
       down on the export of subversion in return for trade? The Secretary replied that this might
       be all right if posed as the kind of question which many Americans will ask. However, one
       gets in a kind of chicken-and-egg argument with the Soviets, with their claiming that
       improvement of relations follows rather than precedes an increase in trade. He said it was
       his conviction that political concessions for any increase in trade are out of the question
       as far as the Soviets are concerned.</p>
                        <p>When Mr. Rockefeller asked if there might not be some Soviet concessions with regard to
       patents or lend lease, the Secretary observed that as the Soviets now have more interest of
       their own in trademarks and patents they have started piecemeal to make some bilateral
       arrangements on these matters. The Secretary went on to draw attention to a particular Soviet
       sensitivity to any implication that their export <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0128"/>market bag doesn't contain sufficiently sophisticated export items.
       Consequently, they may stress to Mr. Rockefeller that they can offer steel mills and advanced
       technology, not just vodka and caviar. The Secretary emphasized that it is most difficult for
       a free enterprise system to have satisfactory trade relations with a state trading
       system.</p>
                        <p>In response to an inquiry, the Secretary touched briefly on credits, saying that we would
       have no real problems with regard to granting normal commercial credit, i.e., up to five
       years, depending on the items, but that long-term credits would cause difficulties. It was
       noted that the Soviets had paid cash for the U.S. wheat sales.</p>
                        <p>On the future use of U.S. bottoms in U.S.-Soviet trade, the Secretary said that any change
       in the present posture could come only within the larger context of a general increase in
       trade. It can be expected that the U.S. shippers and maritime unions will continue their
       strong opposition to the use of foreign shipping.</p>

                        <p>During the first 2 weeks of August 1964, President Johnson and Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> exchanged messages concerning two crises in
       Southeast Asia. Responding to a Soviet statement on the deteriorating situation in Laos,
       Johnson sent <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> a message on August 1 urging
       the Soviet Union not to withdraw from its co-chairmanship under the 1962 Geneva Agreements.
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied on August 7. Johnson's

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> invited me to lunch following
       his return from leave in the Soviet Union. He said he had a talk of about an hour and a half
       with Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> shortly before his departure.
       In the course of the conversation, I asked <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
       what their estimate was of the possibility of the Chinese Communists conducting an atomic
       test. He replied without hesitation that the Soviets thought the Chinese could conduct a test
       at almost any time now.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> seemed quite interested in learning whether
       we were working on any postelection plans, particularly with respect to Germany. He asked me
       directly whether or not the Ambassadorial Group was working on any papers. I replied that we
       had not had a meeting for several months.</p>
                        <p>There was considerable discussion of the American electoral campaign. When I said that in
       the course of the next month or so he would probably read statements that would not be
       particularly pleasing to them, he asked why it was that people like the Secretary felt it
       necessary to discuss publicly such subjects as the Eastern European Communist countries. I
       said that as he knew it was our policy to improve our relations with all countries but as he
       must be aware we frequently ran into difficulties because Congress sometimes put specific
       legal restrictions on some of our activities. I said therefore it was necessary to do a
       certain amount of public education. He appeared to understand my point.</p>
                        <p>I asked the Ambassador if he had any indication of the timing of the Chairman's
       visit to Bonn. He replied he did not, but when I pressed him, he expressed his personal
       opinion that it would not take place in the next month or two.</p>
                        <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102" facs="0130"/>
                        <p>In return, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked if the President had any
       plans for travel after the election. I said I understood that the President did not wish to
       leave the country until there was a Vice President, and pointed out that this would not
       happen until the end of the year. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> raised the
       question of a possible visit by the President to General de Gaulle and said that perhaps the
       President could visit de Gaulle, <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>, and then the
       Soviet Union. I said I had no idea of what the President's thinking was on this
       subject.</p>
                        <p>On his own initiative, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked what I thought
       of Soviet relations with Communist China. I said that I was unable to understand Communist
       Chinese policy and said that in view of all the difficulties they were having internally, it
       was difficult to understand why they pushed their quarrel with the Soviet Union so
       vigorously. I tried to get him to discuss the border quarrel, but without success. When I
       mentioned that the Chinese leadership was far from young, he said that this was true. He
       mentioned that some of the leaders, such as <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou
       En-lai</persName>, were somewhat younger but he said that Chou had little influence on
       Chinese policy and that it was Mao who made the decisions. I inquired whether he thought the
       Chinese would arrange a separate meeting of the Communist Parties supporting them, and he
       said he thought this was quite possible.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked me whether there was any truth in the
       rumors about various moves in our diplomatic service, including my own transfer to Rome. I
       replied that this was pure newspaper speculation and so far as I knew there was nothing to
       these rumors whatever.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked several questions regarding the nature
       of my duties as Acting Deputy Under Secretary and said that there was no equivalent position
       in the Soviet Foreign Office.</p>
                        <p>When I referred to rumors of <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>'s
       illness, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> merely said that for a good many
       years there were repeated rumors of this kind and implied that there was nothing to them.</p>
                        <p>I asked him if the remodeling of our Embassy in Moscow had been completed, thinking that he
       would then raise the question of their desire to obtain a new location in Washington, but he
       did not mention this problem.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that in the Soviet Foreign Service there
       was no compulsory retirement age. He said that they could apply for retirement after age
       fifty-five. He said that most of the people he knew who had retired soon regretted it and
       tried to get back into Government service. He said that Deputy Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> was about sixty-three or sixty-four years of age but
       was in good health and had no intention of retiring.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked me what I thought would be the main
       issues in the American electoral campaign. I said that although Senator <persName corresp="#p_GB1">Goldwater</persName>
                            <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0131"/>and other Republicans had said that foreign affairs
       would be the main issue, that I personally did not think, in the absence of some unusual
       event, that foreign policy issues would affect many voters. I said that my own opinion was
       that domestic issues would be more important. The Ambassador said that he hoped that for the
       next couple of months he and I could take things easy and that there would be no critical
       issues raised in our bilateral relations. I pointed out that there were a number of serious
       problems, such as Cyprus, Viet-Nam, Indonesia, and Laos, but he was disinclined to discuss
       these questions.</p>
                        <p>I also drew attention to the Article 19 problem in the United Nations.<note n="2" xml:id="d42fn2">The United States had raised the issue of applying Article 19 of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter to the Soviet Union-and thereby depriving it of its vote
        in the General Assembly-because it was in arrears. The Soviet Union had refused to pay for
        peacekeeping operations in the Congo and Palestine, claiming that they were illegally
        authorized. The controversy over the issue during 1964 and 1965 is documented extensively in
         <ref target="frus1964-68v33">

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that his impression in Moscow was that
       if they were deprived of their vote in the General Assembly, they would probably withdraw. I
       said that if this problem were not solved, it was a question of whether or not we could
       continue our membership. The Ambassador seemed quite surprised at this and asked me if I
       seriously thought that such a development was possible. I pointed out that it was the
       Congress that had to authorize our contribution, and said that there had long been a feeling
       in the Congress and throughout the country that we were carrying more than our share of the
       expenses of the United Nations. I said that we were not trying to exploit this issue against
       them but merely wanted to solve it. I reminded him that almost a year ago I had emphasized to
       him the seriousness of this problem and the firmness of our position, and said that as he
       knew Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> had made a sincere effort to
       work out with their representatives some solution.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>: And he asked me to give you personally, Mr.

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>: The Chairman frankly thinks, of course, that
       Tonkin Gulf, Cyprus, or the Congo do not necessarily, in his words, you know, decorate the
       U.S. policy. Yet, he added, apparently during the election campaigns some unfortunate things
       occur.</p>
                        <p> President: Now wait a minute, let me see, I'm not understanding. You said the
       Tonkin Gulf, Cyprus, and what?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>: And the Congo.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>: Congo, as he puts in his words, do not
       necessarily decorate, as he frankly thinks, the U.S. policies, but he—</p>
                        <p> President: Do not necessarily what? Now, I didn't understand that.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>: Do not necessarily, in his words, decorate,
       decorate the U.S. policy. Yet, he added, apparently during the election campaigns some
       unfortunate things occur. The Chairman asked me, in conclusion, to tell you, Mr. President,
       that he, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, vote for you, so to speak.</p>
                        <p> President: Uh-huh.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>: Though, he said, that we are not going at
       all to interfere in the American election campaign-he jokingly added that we are not going at
       all to interfere in the American campaign, but he said, that he vote for you, so to speak.
       And once again the Chairman gives you, Mr. President, his personal regards and best
       wishes.</p>
                        <p> President: Fine. Well, I think that you understand our situation here. It's
       better to leave the election matters up to the American people themselves. We never know how
       they'll handle them. Those of us that are candidates always want everybody to
       support us that will in our elections here, but we never can tell how their support will go,
       how they'll vote, and it may look good in September and be bad in November, but
       we'll just have to wait and see, and we hope that everything <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0133"/>works out, and I appreciate your bringing me the
       Chairman's good wishes.</p>

                            <item>Discussion with <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> in his office Saturday,
        September 12th—10:00 to 11:30 a.m.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. I told Rusk of my increasing concern over the evidences of dynamic military effort on
       the part of the Soviets, the appearance of more single silos, the continuation of the testing
       of new and larger missiles, evidences that they are engaged in an extensive radar development
       which may mean <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment or an anti-satellite
       effort—we could not tell, continuing improvement of their nuclear submarine
       program, etc. I said that I was so concerned about all of this that I felt immediately upon
       the completion of 11–8 and 11–3<note n="2" xml:id="d44fn2">National Intelligence Estimate
        11–8–64, “Soviet Capabilities for Strategic Attack,” October 8; and

        in <ref target="frus1964-68v10">

       President, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> and I must sit down and
       review those estimates and concern ourselves with the consequences. I said that it was
       apparent to me that the Soviets were saying one thing in Geneva publicly and doing quite
       another thing privately, from the standpoint of the arms race. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> agreed and said the meeting was necessary. He <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0134"/>hoped that the issue might not get into public print prior to the election.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows material on the Chinese nuclear weapons program and other topics.]</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked what I thought was going on in the
       Communist world. He noted that growing indications of independence on the part of satellite
       leaders, deepening rift between Russia and Communist China, and he wondered just what
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had in mind trying to organize an
       international conference. I said that we too had observed the indicators. I was particularly
       interested in Tito's trip to Hungary and I didn't think Tito was trying
       to mend <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s fences, that on the
       contrary, he was trying to increase his own independent strength. I also said that we agreed
       that the Sino-Soviet rift was deepening, we had noted the deployment of the Soviet division
       to the Chinese border and also the differing positions of local Communist parties, such as
       North Korean castigation of the Russians and their apparent cooperation with the ChiComs.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> questioned the publication of the Togliatti
        letter<note n="3" xml:id="d44fn3">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi>, September 10,
        1964. Palmeiro Togliatti was the late Secretary-General of the Italian Communist
        Party.</note> in Moscow which I could not explain. I agreed that our demonologists would
       take a fresh look at the situation and report from time to time on our analysis as the
       situation evolved and unfolded.</p>

                        <p>I had a long and cordial lunch with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> in which we touched lightly on a large number of topics of only casual
       interest. The points of principal importance are as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. The Ambassador told me that he had conveyed to Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> my private warning against intervention in the political <pb n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0135"/>campaign,<note n="2" xml:id="d45fn2">See <ref target="#d39">Document 39</ref>.</note> and that the Chairman fully understood the message. I told him
       that David Rockefeller had reported the Chairman's remark that he was impressed by
       Scotty Reston's argument to the same effect, and the Ambassador indicated his own
       belief that his message from me had been more influential (I'm not so sure
       myself).</p>
                        <p>2. The Ambassador's principal preoccupation was with the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. While he did not come to the topic until near the close of the lunch, he rang
       all the changes on the subject, representing his views as not only those of his government
       but his own personal deep convictions. Perhaps the most interesting formulation was his claim
       that the U.S. was damaging its own best interests and allowing itself to be dragged along by
       the West Germans. I made the usual argument-and to me the fundamental one-that if the Germans
       were not kept solidly tied to the U.S., very strong political pressures would develop for
       another line of policy that would be dangerous both to the Soviet Union and to us. I found it
       interesting that the Ambassador simply did not comment on this possibility. I also pressed
       upon the Ambassador that if the Soviet Union really found the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> dangerous, it was quite free to move in two directions that would promptly
       undermine the pressure for the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>: (1) it could reduce the
       number of rockets aimed at Western Europe; and (2) it could give the Germans a real prospect
       of reunification. Without saying so directly, I implied strongly that the plan for the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> was a reply to Soviet nuclear deployment and Soviet political
       intransigence. The Ambassador did not appear to be persuaded.</p>
                        <p>3. My own principal effort was to direct the Ambassador's attention to the
       problem of Communist Chinese nuclear weapons. I made it very plain that in our judgment the
       Chinese nuclear weapons would be real dissemination, while the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> was nothing of the sort. I also made it plain that we would be ready for
       private and serious talk on what to do about this problem if there were any interest in the
       Soviet Government. The Ambassador gave no direct reply, but he gave me clearly to understand
       that in the thinking of the Soviet Government the Chinese nuclear capability was already, in
       effect, taken for granted. He argued that Chinese nuclear weapons had no importance against
       the Soviet Union or against the U.S., and that therefore they had only a psychological impact
       in Asia, and he implied that this impact had no importance for his government.</p>
                        <p>4. On China in general, the Ambassador admitted and indeed emphasized the depth and
       strength of the existing split between Moscow and Peking, but he took the view that the
       primary cause of this split was the personal megalomania of Mao. He said that Stalin at his
       worst <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0136"/>had never insisted upon the kind of personal
       worship which was now accorded to Mao. He said that while in the Soviet Union younger men
       (like himself) were coming into positions of responsibility, and were able to argue openly
       and honestly with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, in Communist China the
       older generation and, above all, Mao himself, were still in full charge and were inaccessible
       to reasonable argument. He told me at some length of the dismal experience of Soviet advisers
       trying to warn against the technological nonsense of the Great Leap Forward. But he asserted
       calmly, but strongly, his conviction that in the long run there would be a restoration of
       harmony between the two countries. And at one point, in discussion of our American
       differences with Communist China, he gently remarked on the continued existence of the treaty
       between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the Chicoms.</p>
                        <p>5. The Ambassador was much interested in knowing what I thought would be the timing of
       renewed U.S. diplomatic activity after the election-would it wait until January, or would it
       come in November? I told him that while we would not be in any spectacular rush, neither
       would we be forced to wait until after the inauguration. I indicated my own belief that
       discussions within the Western alliance would be necessary before anything very serious could
       be done between East and West (though at the same time I made clear our benevolent attitude
       toward an early meeting between <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and
        <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>).</p>

                        <p>The powers are trying to keep the matter quiet, at least until after October 6 when the
       attachés should be back in Moscow. (They are concerned that premature publicity
       may force the Soviets to expel the officers involved.) The attachés are now in
       Tokyo and will return to Moscow via New Delhi. In the meantime, the Department is trying to
       get more precise information about the developments. What we have had thus far is sketchy
       information received in Moscow via a tapped telephone line from Khabarovsk.</p>
                        <p>A contingency press statement (Tab C) has been prepared in case the story leaks before

                        </p>
                        <p>There is debate between State and Pentagon on possible retaliatory action.
       State's reaction is negative-feeling retaliation is uncalled for and politically
       unwise. The general tendency at State is to play the incident down, or better yet, try to
       wish it away.</p>
                        <p>Personally, I think this would be a mistake. The Khabarovsk affair is not an isolated
       episode. The British were also involved. Moreover, it was preceded by a weird German incident
       (the mustard gas). In my <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0138"/>view, the Soviet antics
       call for a sharp response rather than noiseless acquiescence. I do not think we can hope to
       keep the lid on this story for long. When the episode hits the press our stance should be
       defensible.</p>
                        <p>We cannot acquiesce in such nonsense. An appropriate reaction would not jeopardize our
       basic relations with the Soviets. The Soviets must know they cannot play this kind of cops
       and robbers and come out unscathed. If we are going to get anywhere with Moscow, the Soviets
       must know that this kind of nonsense will not be tolerated, no matter how strong our desire
       for understanding. And if we make clear the rules of the game, the Soviets are likely to play
       it intelligently. For unless they are interested in some understanding too, there really is
       no deal.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, I think there is an advantage in our taking the lead in putting the story out. We
       used this formula in the microphone and East Berlin shooting incidents and came out well-and
       should do so here. We don't want to be in a position of attempting to cover up for
       the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>When October 6 rolls around we should put out the story frankly, and with a position that
       makes sense. I do not think we need be overconcerned about putting the Soviets on the spot.
       They put themselves there and we will be in a difficult position politically if we do not
       react with sense and vigor.<note n="7" xml:id="d46fn7">On the same day <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> replied that he “fully” agreed

                        <p rend="center">(From Net of Listening Devices in U.S. Embassy Moscow)</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary</p>
                        <p>The results of our review of the political effects of the bugging of our Moscow Embassy are
       paradoxical. On the one hand, in the judgment of the National Security Agency and the Central
       Intelligence Agency, the Soviets achieved a major intelligence breakthrough, i.e., for a
       period of years they had the capability to read most, if not all, of our telegraphic messages
       between Washington and Moscow and between Washington and posts in Eastern Europe. On the
       other hand an extensive review of major crises and negotiations over the past twelve years
       does not provide evidence that the Soviets made use of knowledge thus gained to the detriment
       of our interests.</p>
                        <p>An explanation for this paradox may be that the Soviets valued the source far more than the
       use of any particular piece of information they got from it. In order to keep us from
       discovering their intelligence coup the Soviets appear to have sacrificed many of the
       specific gains they might have made, and eschewed actions that might have given them away. We
       have not found instances where a specific Soviet action can be clearly attributed to a
       particular American message they may have intercepted, and we believe it likely that Moscow
       avoided taking such actions out of fear that they might compromise their operation. But the
       fact that damage to American political interests was not so direct and gross as to be readily
       demonstrable does not mean that there was none. In considering the possible impact which
       information derived from bugging had upon Soviet policymakers' thinking, we find
       large unknown areas. In some instances Soviet awareness of American firmness may have
       redounded to our advantage. On balance, however, we must conclude that Soviet leaders gained
       considerable advantage in their dealings with us, and, over time, they may have felt free to
       pursue more assertive policies because they had a clearer idea of what our reaction might
       be.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Extensive Compromise</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_NSA1">NSA</gloss> assessment, the assessments by State Department
       security experts and information which <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> acquired from a
       defector make it virtually certain that extensive quantities of classified information were
       compromised as a result of the Soviet microphone operation. [<hi rend="italic">8–1/2 lines of
        source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>The classified material compromised included Top Secret, Secret and Confidential
       information. According to the definition of these classifications contained in the
       Department's security regulations pursuant to law, the classifying officer is
       obliged to assign these classifications when in his judgment the unauthorized disclosure of
       the information could, with regard to U.S. foreign policy and defense interests, be
       “prejudicial” (Confidential), result in “serious
       damage” (Secret) or cause “exceptionally grave damage” (Top
       Secret). Thus, if a message was correctly classified in these categories, its revelation to
       the Soviet Union by definition could cause damage to the United States although the Soviets
       were inhibited from exercising to the full their potential to damage our interests. Some
       messages during this period 1952–62 were no doubt overclassified, but even if considerable
       allowance is made for the bad habits of many officers in this respect, small comfort can be
       derived.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Direct, Visible Damage</p>
                        <p>The damage review described above, which was based upon the worst-case assumption that
       everything had been compromised, found little evidence of political damage. Indeed, some of
       the officers working on the political assessment found it difficult to believe that an
       extensive compromise had in fact occurred. No instance could be found in which Moscow was
       shown to have made a specific decision detrimental to U.S. interest on the basis of
       information derived from reading particular messages.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Limits on Soviet Use of Information</p>
                        <p>The Soviets probably regarded their microphone installation as a major intelligence asset.
       Certainly if the circumstances had been reversed the United States Government would have
       thought so. Such a Soviet judgment would have led to a policy of self-denial of use of the
       information derived. Soviet intelligence officers may well have hoped that this source of
       information might give them advance warning in the event that the United States ever decided
       to attack the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and they would have been reluctant to
       jeopardize the source. In fact the very thing the Department's reviewers looked
       for-a Soviet action directly attributable to an intercepted message-would be the very thing
       which a Soviet intelligence officer would have resisted hardest-the use of information in a
       manner which might make us suspect the source.</p>
                        <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0141"/>
                        <p>The one instance in which a Departmental reviewer concluded that an intercepted American
       message probably altered the course of negotiation involved possible initiation of
       hostilities. The review of the Korean armistice negotiations suggested that Soviet
       interception of a May 23, 1953 cable from the Department to Moscow revealing our contingency
       plans to resume hostilities if our forthcoming proposal was not accepted may have been the
       determining factor in prompting Moscow to accept a settlement.</p>
                        <p>We know that Soviet intelligence regarded information derived from our telegrams as
       especially sensitive, and we suspect that many of the lower-ranking officials who conducted
       negotiations on such issues as the hot line or the consular convention were never privy to
       the operation. When <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> told Ambassador
        <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> that he read his message opposing sale of a
       large diameter pipe to the Soviet Union (though <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> did not describe the message accurately), he was doubtless guilty of
       a serious breach of security.</p>
                        <p>In addition to their reluctance to jeopardize their source of potentially invaluable
       information, the Soviets were probably also concerned-though to a much lesser extent-over
       possible embarrassment in being caught.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Operational vs. Background Information</p>
                        <p>Both our review of the messages themselves and inferences about Soviet handling of the
       information support the conclusion that Moscow derived very little, if any, operational
       information upon which they based specific actions.</p>
                        <p>They always had the hope that by preserving the source, they might one day derive extremely
       useful operational information, namely, advance warning of an American attack, and that very
       hope would have made them very reluctant to sacrifice their source in exploiting it for
       lesser purposes.</p>
                        <p>But apart from operational information, the Soviets did over the years acquire a good deal
       of background information. No single piece of this information would necessarily have altered
       particular decisions, but this kind of information would have given the Soviets some valuable
       knowledge of United States policymaking processes, some psychological advantages and may over
       the longer run have strengthened Moscow's capability for confronting the United
       States.</p>
                        <p>If the Soviets read our notes before they were delivered, they may have had a few extra
       hours to consider their responses which doubtless made their own decision-making easier,
       though that may well have been to our advantage at times. In reading our reporting messages,
       the Soviets would have learned no little about how our foreign service operates, about the
       personalities of various American officers and about <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0142"/>the kinds of démarches or talking points which did or did not impress us. Even
       though they refrained from taking any direct action on the basis of information in our
       messages the Soviets would have derived either confirmation or disproof of their estimates
       about our foreign policy based upon other sources of information.</p>
                        <p>In the aggregate, background information was probably useful to the top Soviet leadership.
       For example, in the period after the Sputnik and the firing of the first Soviet ICBM our
       estimates of Soviet strategic missiles were inaccurate. The Soviets would not have learned
       the details of our estimates from their microphone operations, but they probably would have
       had confirmation of their impression based upon other sources that United States policy was
       being made on the basis of estimates of the military balance which erred in their favor. Also
       of general background utility would have been the knowledge required of differences among the
       United States and its Allies.</p>
                        <p>In attempting to assess the impact which background information may have had on Soviet
       policy, we are faced with imponderables. We have no way of proving how much of a role
       background information derived from bugging played in the totality of information used by the
       Soviet decision makers. We suspect that in general Moscow derived a clearer impression of the
       limits of American tolerance for possible mischief. In many instances it was doubtless to our
       advantage that the Soviet leadership realized the dangers and stopped short of precipitating
       potentially grave situations. At the same time, a better estimate of the limits of safety may
       have tempted the Soviets to play a bit closer to the limits than they might otherwise have
       done.</p>

       reference telegrams was predictable in view of rich dividends of Khabarovsk Hotel room raid
       and regrettable publicity of incident.</p>
                        <p>Determining nature of our tactical response to Soviet moves presents serious problems. In
       first place British requirements in pre-electoral period, as Dept aware, likely be somewhat
       different from ours. Secondly, Sovs have good case in light of pertinent international law as
       well as in eyes of world public opinion (which they could support if they wished to do so by
       public display of equipment, maps and notes seized in Khabarovsk) when they argue that
       activities of attachés were not only illegal under Soviet law but impermissible
       under accepted diplomatic practices.</p>
                        <p>Thus it seems to me that if we are to go to the mat with the Sovs on this case we must
       focus our fire not on activities of attachés but rather on behavior of Soviet
       agents toward attachés. Certainly we can argue cogently that invasion of hotel
       rooms, forcible restraint of personnel, and denial of request to contact Emb are all in
       contravention of requirements placed on host state by concept of diplomatic immunity. This is
       fundamental question of principle which cannot be breached by acquiescing in Sov demand or by
       failure immediately to take issue with Sov position. Thus it seems to me that first order of
       business should be to support formally and at high level line taken by <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Toon</persName> this morning with <persName corresp="#p_SMN1">Smirnovsky</persName>.</p>
                        <p>In light these considerations it seems to me our choice of immediate course of action lies
       among following:</p>
                        <p>(1) Reject proposal contained in oral <persName corresp="#p_SMN1">Smirnovsky</persName>
       statement thus forcing <gloss target="#t_PNG1">PNG</gloss> action by <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>, and then retaliating in kind on one for one basis. This assumes
       attachés return to Moscow on schedule, which I regard as essential test, since
       Soviet prohibition of return would in fact amount to <gloss target="#t_PNG1">PNG</gloss>
       action.</p>
                        <p>(2) Accept proposal made orally by <persName corresp="#p_SMN1">Smirnovsky</persName> and
       then retaliate in identical fashion. If we follow this course of action, ideally we should
       muster similar charges and evidence against Soviet personnel <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0145"/>to be withdrawn. I assume from my own experience in the Dept that evidence
       against particular <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> personnel necessary for <gloss target="#t_PNG1">PNG</gloss> action is already on file and available for immediate
       exploitation.</p>
                        <p>(3) Reject or accept Soviet offer but in lieu of direct retaliation withdraw diplomatic
       immunity from all Soviet Attaché personnel pending clarification through bilateral
       consultations of unprecedented Soviet statement on immunity concept made to Aubrey in
       Khabarovsk.</p>
                        <p>My own preference is of course one. Conclusive consideration, in my mind is that while we
       are in weak position to counter Soviet charges, we cannot put ourselves in worse position of
       appearing to accept them by unilateral withdrawal of personnel involved. However, any of
       three suggested courses would be acceptable from my point of view, provided action taken is
       prompt and unequivocal. In any alternative, I would repeat that it should be made clear that
       action is taken in accordance with our refusal to acquiesce in fundamental breach of basic
       immunity concept rather than our insistence that activities of attaché personnel
       were legal and permissible in accordance with diplomatic norms.</p>

                        <p>1029. Literally Eyes Only for Ambassador from Secretary. Regarding our recent
       attaché problem, I want you to know that I have raised in <gloss target="#t_USIB1">USIB</gloss> the question of giving better advice to attachés and other
       intelligence personnel about methods and conduct under the different circumstances of
       different countries to which they are assigned. Quite frankly, my impression is that our
       attachés acted with great naivete and that comparable conduct on the part of
       Soviet attachés in the United States would have been considered by us as
       unacceptable. For this reason, we have emphasized the violations of immunity through
       intrusion and searches by Soviet security personnel but I am not at all comfortable <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0146"/>about the intelligence used by our own people in
       carrying out their mission. This is not the first instance where such cases have arisen and I
       have asked for a review of procedures.<note n="2" xml:id="d50fn2">On October 11 <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> replied that he, too, had long been concerned with the
        attaché problem, feeling that the requirements for their activities were based on
        obsolete concepts of intelligence gathering. In the present case he feared that the loss of
        notes and information probably outweighed all the intelligence gathered by this means over a
        long period of time. (Telegram 1075; ibid.) Citing the Khabarovsk affair and an incident in
        Poland, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> wrote <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> on December 24 proposing a review of policies and procedures governing

                            <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> announced late today that 70-year-old Nikita
       Sergeyevich <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has been replaced as First
       Secretary of the <gloss target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss> and as Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> Council of Ministers on grounds of age and health.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Move Sudden</hi>. All indications suggest that the move was sudden and
       forced upon <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. Not only was he divested of
       his top party and state jobs, but he lost his job on the Presidium of the Party. It is within
       the realm of possibility that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> indeed
       suffered a sudden deterioration in his health for he has evidently been in a less than
       perfect state of health for some time. Embassy Moscow has reported that the <gloss target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss> Presidium insisted that he take his latest vacation and that
       he severely restrict the number of visitors he received. However, his removal from the <gloss target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss> Presidium while the apparently still paralyzed Kozlov stays
       on suggests that his departure might not have been entirely voluntary.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Possible Reasons For Removal</hi>. There have been increasing signs of
       disenchantment with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
       rambunctious, shotgun initiative style of leadership. He himself admitted in August that
       “some comrades” objected to his revealing the subject of the next Party
       plenum. Domestically, the precipitating cause may have been <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s latest efforts to alter significantly the pattern of
       resource allocation away from the heavy industry-military complex towards the consumer and
       agriculture. Pravda on October 2 printed a truncated version of a <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> speech on the subject which suggests that the issues were far from
       resolved.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Little Immediate Change in Domestic Policy Foreseen</hi>. The published
       statements of both <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> have not revealed any significant <pb n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0148"/>divergence from <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s views, nor are they like several other Presidium members
       reputed to be “hard-liners.” This may well be only the preliminary
       solution. If history repeats itself, the leadership will be preoccupied with further
       resolving the succession and the direction of policy change will be expressed in further
       personnel shifts. The reported sacking of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s son-in-law as Editor of Izvestiya, the failure of two
       close <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> supporters—Shelest and
       Rashidov—to show up at a recent Moscow reception suggests that such shifts are in
       the offing. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s position as
       chairman of the <gloss target="#t_RSFSR1">RSFSR</gloss> Party Bureau will presumably have to
       be filled. The 1962 bifurcation of the Party into political and economic hierarchies left the
       Central Committee in a state of uncertainty which will open the way for considerable
       political maneuvering in the coming weeks.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Foreign Policy Issues</hi>. There are no discernible foreign policy issues
       critical enough, or on which disagreement appeared serious enough, to have served as the
       motivation for <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s ouster. While
       there may have been dissatisfaction with his China policy, Chinese personal attacks against
       him probably worked to solidify support in his favor. It is possible that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> may have been contemplating some radical new
       proposals on a foreign policy issue, perhaps Germany, but on balance we believe this
       unlikely.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Implications for Soviet Policy</hi>. Initially, at least, the new
       leadership is likely to be preoccupied with the internal problem of consolidating its own
       position and relatively cautious about actively engaging in negotiations with the West.
       Indeed, we have already been in a period of hiatus in East-West negotiations while the
       Soviets seemed to be waiting out the American election campaign. Moreover, there have been
       reasons to suppose that some of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s disarmament policies may have had opposition at home, in
       particular his initiative for a unilateral cut in the size of Soviet forces and an apparent
       intention to extend the idea of “mutual example” to troop deployments
       in Europe. Moscow's refusal at the Geneva disarmament conference even to move on
       an issue such as the creation of a technical working group on nuclear delivery vehicles may
       also have reflected a freezing of Soviet disarmament policy (after signs of motion in June)
       resulting from internal disagreements.</p>
                        <p>If, as seems likely, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s ouster
       was primarily based upon conflicts over allocation of economic resources, it would seem that
       the resultant policies would militate against further Soviet moves on disarmament issues in
       coming months.</p>
                        <p>The new leadership is likely to wish to avoid tests of strength with the West at least
       until after it feels that its internal position is consolidated. We would expect the new
       regime, even if it may feel that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s policy on the German question was faulty, at least to
       delay <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0149"/>any new crisis over Berlin. Similarly, we
       doubt that the regime will be prepared to make any early moves on such issues as overflights
       of Cuba. However, the succession period could generate sudden and unpredictable pressures on
       the new leadership, and we cannot rule out the possibility either of adventurous action or of
       some dramatic initiative toward improving relations with the West. Nevertheless, it is more
       likely that the new leaders will seek to keep things on an even keel rather than risk adding
       to their existing problems.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Effect on Sino-Soviet Relations</hi>. It does not seem likely that
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s ouster will effect any basic
       or longlasting change in Moscow's posture toward Communist China. There may,
       however, be a slight and temporary easing of the dispute as Peiping holds its fire to see how
       the Soviet scene jells, and as the new Soviet leadership also marks time to see if <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s removal offers any real prospects for
       an adjustment with the Chinese. In particular, the Soviets may temporarily call off their
       push for an international communist conference to condemn the Chinese—a course
       that has always confronted them with great difficulties and is unsure of success. In any
       case, the retirement of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will be interpreted
       by the Chinese as a victory for their policies. The new Soviet leadership will have to make
       clear as quickly as possible to the world communist movement just how it intends to meet the
       Chinese Communist challenge.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Effect on Eastern Europe</hi>. Any change in the Soviet leadership
       automatically becomes a source of instability in Eastern Europe. The peoples and leaders of
       these countries will probably adopt a wait and see attitude toward the new rulers. Unless a
       clear line emanates soon from the Kremlin, dissident elements within Eastern Europe may seek
       to take advantage of the situation, especially since some satellite leaders, e.g., in
       Czechoslovakia, have relied heavily on <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s blessing to bolster their strength.</p>

                        <p>1148. We find it difficult believe that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
       was removed from all party and govt responsibilities “for reasons of age and
       health” as announced by CC–<gloss target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss> tonight.
       Important to note that he was ousted not only from premiership and first secretaryship slot
       but also from membership in Presidium. Kozlov has been paralyzed and mentally ill for over a
       year and is still member of Presidium; Kuusinen retained his membership until his death at
       age of 83—far more advanced than <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s 70. In any case, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> apparently was in good health—although perhaps not
       spirits—when Palewski saw him at Gagra two days ago. After that he returned by air
       to Moscow, arriving on the afternoon of the 13th. Presumably he would not have done this
       unless convoked personally to the Central Committee meeting on the 14th, since a really ill
       man's “request to be relieved” could have been considered in
       his absence. Thus if there any “illness” involved it could not be any
       sudden crisis or deterioration, but something more chronic or slow-moving. This would not
       have required such precipitate action, embarrassing to the visit of the Cuban President and
       to the full exploitation of the “Voskhod” flight. We cannot therefore
       accept the published explanation.</p>
                        <p>It is also not credible that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would have
       chosen willingly to retire from all leadership activity for any other
       “personal” reasons at a time when most of the foreign and bloc policies
       with which he is identified were such failures or are in such a mess that he must inevitably
       be made the scapegoat by any successors. His belligerent posture on Berlin in the 1958–60
       period was an egregious failure; his Cuban venture of 1962 equally so. His economic and
       agricultural policies have paid few dividends and have, in the main, simply resulted in
       compounding the Soviets' economic dilemma and in the process placed severe strains
       on Soviet resources. But, above all, his personal vendetta with Mao, with the attendant
       strain on Soviet relations with bloc parties, both in and out of power, has substantially
       weakened the world Communist movement and the Soviet role as its vanguard. Beyond this,
       Soviet posture has suffered from <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s recent gaffes in his impromptu remarks to visiting
       delegations and journalists—particularly his flat statement that the Soviets would
       not withdraw from <pb n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0151"/>the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> regardless of the outcome of Article 19 issue. All of this must add up to a
       sorry record, indeed, in the eyes of his comrades.</p>
                        <p>It is, therefore, hard to escape the conclusion that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has been jettisoned by his colleagues. Just why and how this occurred
       is far from clear at the moment. The keys would seem to lie mainly in the person of <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>, whose ambitions <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has been obviously trying to frustrate and in the problem of the
       Sino-Soviet split—in what way and what proportions we cannot determine at this
       point.</p>
                        <p>At the moment we would not, as result of change in top command, expect any major change of
       policies except in area of Sino-Soviet dispute. We would guess that one of first results
       would be shift in tactics on conference issue closer to position held by PGI <note n="2" xml:id="d52fn2">Presumably a reference to the PCI (Partito Communista Italiana), the Italian
        Communist Party.</note> and Rumania.</p>
                        <p>In other major areas of foreign policy—particularly attitude toward <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>—we anticipate no basic change. In this connection, I
       am impressed in retrospect by tenor of remarks by Polyansky and Dymshits to me this evening
       at Afghan reception; both took considerable pains to impress upon me desirability continued
       improvement our bilateral relations after recovering from “shock” at
       initial exchange re “exciting news"—Embtel 1146.<note n="3" xml:id="d52fn3">Dated October 15 (9 p.m.), it reported that three usually reliable

                        </list>
                        <p>1. A special meeting of a small group of members of the National Security Council was
       convened at the White House at 1030<note n="2" xml:id="d53fn2">The President's
        Daily Diary indicates that the meeting began at 10:51 a.m. and lasted no later than 11:22
        and was held in the Cabinet Room. (Johnson Library)</note> on 16 October 1964 to discuss the
       change of government in Moscow. In attendance were the President, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BG1">Ball</persName>, Under
       Secretary <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>, McGeorge Bundy, the <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss>, and the undersigned. After some preliminary discussions, a
       great deal of which related to the Presidential campaign and the President's
       schedule of activities, the <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> discussed the fall of
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and his replacement by <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>,
       referring to the picture-chart showing the place of the various Soviet leaders in the party
       and government structure in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Then the <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> mentioned as probable cause of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s downfall his somewhat erratic personal behavior and
       statements in recent months, failure in his Communist party leadership (bringing on the
       bitter Sino-Soviet split and difficult relations with the satellites as well as Communist
       parties in Western Europe), and the bitter controversy over allocation of economic resources,
       centering in a dispute over priority for consumer goods versus military programs.</p>
                        <p>2. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that he and Ambassador
        <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> agreed with this general analysis and
       emphasized he felt the President should make sure there was no anxiety in the U.S. over this
       change of the Soviet leadership since American policy is made in Washington not Moscow. Our
       attitude should be that we are prepared for whatever comes and will continue on a steady
       course. We do not know whether the new Soviet leaders will be better or worse than <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. We should not adopt the view that they are likely
       to be worse. After all, it was <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> who brought
       on the Berlin crisis and the Cuba missile crisis in 1962. Our approach should be watchful but
       steady, and we should be ready to cooperate with Moscow in steps toward international peace
       if the new leaders wish to move in this direction.</p>
                        <p>3. It was generally agreed that this should be the U.S. position provided <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0153"/>that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, who was scheduled to see the President at 1130 hours,<note n="3" xml:id="d53fn3">See <ref target="#d55">Document 55</ref>.</note> took the cordial and
       reassuring position that everyone at the meeting thought he was likely to adopt.</p>
                        <p>4. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> also said that the thin majority of
       the Labor Government in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> was likely to be bad for
       decisive policy-making in the broader interests of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and
        <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> community. No one suggested that there was anything in
       particular that we could do about this, and Bundy observed that about all he could suggest
       was that the President should make a phone call suggesting a meeting after the U.S. election
       since Harold Wilson couldn't be kept away from the White House anyway and that the
       President might as well take the initiative.</p>
                        <p>5. The President said that he had decided it would be wise for him to cancel part of his
       campaign plans and stay in Washington for several days to deal with all of these complicated
       new developments in national and world affairs. He said that he wanted Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, and the <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> to surface some of these
       key issues, at least for the benefit of the Congressional leadership, to show that the
       President and his Administration were attending to business even at the expense, if
       necessary, of some political campaigning.</p>

                            <item>Meeting in Cabinet Room—10:30—16 October 1964</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>In answer to a question from the President, I first pointed out by reference to the
       organization chart furnished by OCI that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had
        <pb n="126" xml:id="pg_126" facs="0154"/>been elevated to Chairman of the Presidium and thus
       Head of Government. <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> as Soviet Party First
       Secretary is the head of the Communist Party apparatus which controls the Presidium. I said
       that little is known of the relationship of <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> to
        <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>. Both are known to be capable and
       well-trained for their respective responsibilities but probably lack a strong following which
       would make possible effective and dynamic leadership. I therefore surmise that the
       arrangement would be temporary and that eventually one or the other, or possibly some other
       individual, would evolve as the leader of both the Presidium and the Party. I recalled that
       this was the evolution in the years following Stalin's death.</p>
                        <p>I made the judgment that the explanation of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s age and health was a cover and that his removal from
       power was because of an issue, the nature of which we could not accurately judge. I noted
       that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s behavior in the past
       several months as evidenced by his rather odd and inconsistent statements to Drew Pearson,
       Bill Benton, to the Japanese Foreign Minister and to the Heads of Government in the
       Scandinavian countries must have displeased members of the Presidium and exposed him to
       attack by them. In addition his strong advocacy of a program giving consumer needs the
       highest priority had apparently met with resistance from the military. Also there
       unquestionably was deep distress over Moscow's loss of leadership of the World
       Communist movement as evidenced by the independence of the satellites, the actions of the
       Communist Parties in France and Italy, the Sino-Soviet split and all the rest. Any one or all
       three of these matters could be the cause of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s removal.<note n="2" xml:id="d54fn2">At a meeting of the
        National Security Council the next day, <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>
        stated that “undoubtedly his [<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s] efforts to remold their economy and change the priority
        from heavy industry and military to consumer goods was the 'straw that broke the
        back' and caused his removal.” (Memorandum for the Record by <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>, October 17; Central Intelligence Agency, <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> (<persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>) Files: Job
        80–B01285A, <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> Meetings with the President)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>I then said that <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> were logical candidates for the two positions and
       obviously were <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s choice. If
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> remained a member of the Presidium, I
       would expect a continuation of all of his policies; however with his precipitous removal from
       the Presidium I would assume that an issue of great depth arose and therefore we could expect
       a change in Soviet policy along some line and it would probably be directed towards regaining
       their leadership of International Communism which would involve straightening out the
       differences with the Chinese, but this was merely a matter of conjecture.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador said he had asked to come in under instructions to inform the President of
       the governmental changes which had been made in the Soviet Union. He read a statement that
       was virtually identical with the <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> statement announcing
       the new appointments and the resignation of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d55fn2">For text of the <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> statement, October 16, see American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1964,

                        </p>
                        <p>Speaking without notes, the Ambassador went on to say that he had been instructed to inform
       the President that the general foreign policy of the Soviet Union had been set forth by the
       Twentieth, Twenty-first, and Twenty-second Party Congresses and that this policy remained
       unchanged. He said that the Soviet Government would, in the future, adhere steadfastly to
       this course. He said that this meant the pursuit of peaceful coexistence and the relaxation
       of tensions. The Ambassador said that the Soviet Government would seek the peaceful
       settlement of current problems and would continue its efforts to achieve disarmament and to
       strengthen the United Nations. He said that the Soviet Government counted on other
       governments to show respect for the sovereignty and independence of other nations.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed his appreciation for this personal report. He said it was his aim
       to achieve better understanding with all nations. He said that the quest for peace by this
       Government had never been more determined than it was now. The President said that there was
       always some concern when there were changes in governments, but he was not as excited or
       alarmed as the Soviets probably would be if <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0156"/>we had a
       change of government here in January. He said he looked forward to seeing more of the
       Ambassador and appreciated the fact that relations with him had always been based on candor
       and friendliness. He felt that he could speak frankly to the Ambassador and thought that the
       Ambassador felt the same way.</p>
                        <p>The President referred to the death of our beloved President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> who had been doing all he could in seeking peace and pointed out that he
       had continued the same course. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s resignation for reasons of health was not as great a
       shock as had been the death of our President, but he hoped that the Soviets would maintain
       the same continuity of a peaceful policy. If the President had another term, perhaps we could
       make progress on the objective of easing tensions in the field of disarmament and in turning
       down our military activities. He said he wished to make clear that we don't want
       to bury the Soviet Union but, on the other hand, we were not going to be buried by them. The
       President thought there was no reason for us to be frightened of each other. He was prepared
       to go to bed in the same room with the Ambassador without a pistol, and thought the
       Ambassador felt the same way. The problem was how to get our peoples to understand this.</p>
                        <p>The President quoted Charles Lamb, who, after reading a book, threw the book down and said,
       “I don't like that man.” When he was asked if he knew the
       author, he said he did not and that if he did, he would probably like him. The President said
       in his experience in Government, he had often felt the same way about people but when he got
       to know them, he usually found his assumptions about them had been in error. The President
       wanted to meet the needs of our people rather than spend our money on military preparedness.
       He referred to the hot line and the Test Ban and stressed the importance of getting away from
       old antagonisms. Perhaps the Soviet Union could lead us to a more blessed world. The
       President said his guard was up, but his hand was out.</p>
                        <p>The President said he would like to stress to the Ambassador two words. The first of these
       was “peace.” In this country we had many things to do rather than make
       bombs. We needed more schools, hospitals, and roads, and he did not like spending fifty
       billion dollars a year in preparing to destroy somebody. Our mission was peace.</p>
                        <p>The President said the second word he wished to stress was flexibility. He told the
       Ambassador the story of the experience he had as a young Congressman when in a public meeting
       he had been unable to get the representative of a power company to do what the people wanted
       and had finally lost his temper and told the man to go to hell. He said everyone had
       applauded except one old man who was a lawyer. This man took him aside and pointed out that
       it was one thing <pb n="129" xml:id="pg_129" facs="0157"/>to tell a man to go to hell and a
       different one to make him go there. The man said he had spent two months getting this
       particular meeting organized and that it had been destroyed in two minutes. It was necessary
       to be flexible. The President said he had told Chancellor Erhard that Adenauer had given him
       the impression that the Communists would eat him up before breakfast, but that he was not
       scared about this. He said he had told Chancellor Erhard that in determining his policy he
       should endeavor to put himself into the Soviet shoes and to examine what their concerns
       were.</p>
                        <p>The President then referred to the missile crisis in Cuba and said that at that time
       neither side knew what would happen. It was an embarrassing business for both sides; for us
       because of the presence of these missiles so near to us, and for the Soviets because they
       were obliged to remove them. The point, however, was that in this situation we had been a
       little flexible and, for that matter, so had the Soviets. The President did not question that
       the Soviets wanted peace as we did, but we both had problems. The Soviets would have to bend
       a little bit and so would we.</p>
                        <p>The President said he had been proud when the Soviets had their recent success in space. It
       was true that we were competitive people and he would have liked to have achieved this first,
       but he looked on such things as this as being for the benefit of mankind. He said we were not
       going to be provocative and he was not going to try to be elected on the basis of denouncing
       the Soviet Union. He thought our system was best and he knew that the Ambassador thought
       their system was best. We could not see everything alike and he pointed out that every man
       did not want the same woman for a wife, some liked blondes, some liked brunettes, and some
       redheads.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the Soviet Union had the capacity to kill a hundred million
       Americans and we had the capacity to kill a hundred million Russians, but this was not what
       he wanted to do. The President referred to his early experiences as a young man when he had
       to work with his hands and feet, but what he wanted to do now was to use his heart and head.
       The President said that if Goldwater won the election, we would perhaps have to try to calm
       him down, but the important thing was that the American people wanted peace. The President
       said that in his travels around the country whenever he talked about peace and the Test Ban,
       he had a wonderful response from his audiences. While he had no doubt about Soviet desire for
       peace, he had some doubts about their flexibility. He referred to the problem of the United
       Nations and said that some way must be found to deal with this problem. The President said he
       was willing to go anywhere and talk to anyone if this would be fruitful. The President said
       that the remarks he was making to the Ambassador represented his genuine feelings; they <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0158"/>were not the result of any briefing, but said that the
       things he had been saying represented the views of his advisers and he mentioned Secretaries
        <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName>, and Ambassador
        <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that people everywhere
       wanted peace.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed and, referring to recent public opinion polls on the election, said
       that his lead over Goldwater was higher with women than with men because women particularly
       wanted peace. He urged Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> to inform
       the new Government of these frank statements of his views. He said he would not be a
       push-over but he had had all the shooting he wanted and referred to his wartime experiences.
       When our destroyer had been shot at in the Gulf of Tonkin, we had responded, but had done so
       responsibly. We could not allow ourselves to be shot at on the high seas. The President said
       a good many people wanted him to go north in Viet-Nam and he mentioned <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, Rockefeller, and other Republican leaders and said there
       were some in his own Party. What the President wanted in Viet-Nam, however, was for the
       people there to be left in peace. We wanted to get out but he would not turn these people
       over to someone attempting to dominate them by force. The independence of this area was our
       aim and he thought this was what we had agreed to. He said he thought the Soviets had even
       greater problems than we with the trouble-makers in this area.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the President said there were many changes taking place. There was
       apparently a new British Government now, a new Soviet Government, and the German Government
       was fairly new. He supposed that in time there would be new leadership in France and perhaps
       even in the United States, but in the United States we were following a policy of peace and
       flexibility and would continue to do so. He would be glad to see or talk to the Ambassador at
       any time that he had problems and he looked forward, after the election if he were returned,
       to getting on to making progress along the lines he had indicated.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>For what it is worth, this is my view of the Soviet scenario.</p>
                        <p>(1) I am struck by the coincidence of the overthrow of Nikita with the Chinese test and
       more particularly, the French Communist Party's declaration of independence.</p>
                        <p>(2) I think Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> was right in his
       message this morning pointing out Nikita's lack of success in handling major
        issues.<note n="2" xml:id="d56fn2">
                                <ref target="#d52">Document 52</ref>.</note> But a theme that seems to dominate the others
       is the Chinese-Soviet split with the consequent problems raised not only in Moscow and the
       satellites, but also reaching deep into the Communist Parties outside the bloc. The problem
       is clearly a festering one and continuing along this Khrushchevian course, it is conceivable
       that the hierarchy felt that the situation was certain to worsen.</p>
                        <p>(3) This suggests at least two possible alternatives. A decision to try to paper over the
       problem with Peking and thereby attempt to slow down the deterioration; or a decision to
       bring the problem to rapid decision, letting the chips fall where they may, but ending the
       uncertainty and consequent confusion and conflict.</p>
                        <p>(4) In either circumstance, it is not difficult to postulate the hierarchy's
       need to eliminate Nikita. If the papering over course was to be followed—and this
       will be tested by what the new regime does or does not do about the forthcoming December
       meeting—then Nikita had to be replaced by a leadership more palatable to
       Peking.</p>
                        <p>(5) On the other hand, if the decision is to break quickly and cleanly with Peking,
       Nikita's tactics were unsuitable and new hands and leadership were needed.</p>
                        <p>(6) Significant in all this is the new government's attempt to reassure other
       governments (Western governments) of Soviet intentions to continue on the Khrushchevian
       course of peaceful co-existence. If <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0160"/>Moscow enters a
       more serious stage of conflict with Peking, then there is a need to batten down the hatches.
       This perhaps would also be true if Moscow wanted to try papering over its problems with
       Peking. But in the latter contingency Moscow has to be ambidextrous for peaceful co-existence
       with the West is not compatible with Moscow-Peking cooperation.</p>
                        <p>(7) In any event, it is clear that for the moment we are going to see a slow down in Soviet
       diplomacy, at least as far as East-West relations are concerned, until the government shakes
       itself down and the leadership takes hold.</p>
                        <p>(8) Over the longer term, two-headed leadership is improbable. It couldn't work
       in this country, and is even less likely to work in the Soviet Union. It is only convenient
       during the interregnum when time is needed to establish leadership. At this juncture, the
       odds are in <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s favor. He controls
       the important lever of power. However, the Soviet game also includes coalitions and
       divisions, and the shape of the possible coalitions is not clear. I would go slowly in
       suggesting that Podgorny is the most likely successor. He may be, but no one really
       knows.</p>
                        <p>(9) From our viewpoint, it is important to indicate to the new government our intention to
       continue along the course we have been going. This is the only one that makes any sense and
       permits us to deal with the urgent and crucial issues facing both of us.</p>

                                <ref target="#d52">Document 52</ref>.</note> While we believe our initial analysis of
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s downfall remains essentially
       valid, some refinement, as result further reflection and on basis additional
       indicators—especially today's Pravda leader—now seems
       warranted.</p>
                        <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133" facs="0161"/>
                        <p>With new team moving to establish itself we are seeing beginnings of exposition of its
       position, from which it possible to read something of anatomy of change which has
       occurred.</p>
                        <p>As key statement thus far, <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> leader serves general function of
       assuring Soviet population and other readers of legitimacy of new leadership and of essential
       continuity of national policies and goals. This is, in a sense, paralleled by statements
       Soviet Ambassadors in West are now making to host governments concerning continuity of
       policy. We would suspect that new leadership is in communication as well with bloc
       leaders—particularly on matters of direct bloc significance and interest.</p>
                        <p>Burden of Pravda leader lies in strong if general assertion of main line of party in
       classical terms with emphasis on continuity of drive toward Leninist goals, with people,
       party and collective leadership moving together. In this connection, we are struck by renewal
       of reference, along with 20th and 22nd, to Twenty-first Party Congress—still
       ignored as recently as previous day—possibly designed to show leadership as heirs
       to entire range of recent party decisions. Tone of declaratory portions of statement is
       exhortatory and includes call for solidarity which, however, in less strident terms than
       previous such appeals and may imply confidence that its position and control established.</p>
                        <p>Beyond thematic function, statement bears on number of policy areas to shed some light on
       line or tactics of new leadership:</p>
                        <p>1. Foreign policy statement essentially repeats previous coexistence line, with inclusion
       of references to strengthening defense potential of <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
       safeguarding integrity of frontiers. This not only calculated to reassure Soviet military and
       dissuade any who might contemplate attempt exploit change but should give pause to
       speculation that strategy, as opposed to tactics, toward Chinese may be shifting. At same
       time, reference to safeguarding security of entire socialist community, while not new, is
       reminder to Chinese and world at large that Soviet commitment remains valid.</p>
                        <p>2. Position statement on international Communist conference stands almost alone in Pravda
       leader as explicit expression of policy on specific issue. This quick declaration seems
       clearly to demonstrate urgency and fundamental importance of issue as factor in leadership
       change.</p>
                        <p>Declaration on conference noteworthy for (1) silence on preparatory meeting (2) reference
       to universality of attendance and (3) broadened catalogue of aims, which should make it
       acceptable to all including Italians, Rumanians, and possibly Chinese.</p>
                        <p>There is no hint—and we believe it would be basic mistake to read
       signs—to shift in strategy on or lines of policy on Chinese issue. What statement
       does is to open options to new leadership which <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0162"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s actions had foreclosed.
       Above and beyond fact that he personally, as Chinese devil, represented bar to any cooling of
       dispute, series of Soviet actions had left little choice to forcing December 15th meeting in
       spite almost inevitable failure to achieve declared Soviet purpose. Recent protestations new
       statement opens possibility that leadership can (1) leave schedule as it presently stands
       pending reaction from other parties and make renewed private appeal to all parties to attend
       upcoming meetings with special efforts to placate Rumanians, Cubans, Indonesians, Vietnamese
       etc. or (2) use <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s removal as
       excuse to postpone conference till more propitious time or, conceivably decide to drop whole
       idea as <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> mistake. Publication today of
       resolution adopted by French CP plenum October 9 and 10, would tend to suggest that for time
       being new leadership favoring first option.</p>
                        <p>Key, however, lies in very fact that options are now available along with greater
       possibilities to repair relations with bloc and other major parties, while gaining breathing
       space to deal with underlying and continuing power struggle with Peiping.</p>
                        <p>3. Treatment of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s faults could
       relate primarily to economic-administrative problems. It appears likely that some
       Khrushchevian economic policy or perhaps even specific economic-administrative proposition
       may have been important factor in formation of a coalition against him. Possible that such
       proposal or policy may have been advanced by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> or discussed at length at the recent mysterious meeting of the
       Presidium, Council of Ministers and top party and economic leaders of the country reported
       Embtel 957.<note n="3" xml:id="d57fn3">Dated October 2. (National Archives and Records
        Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 12 <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>It would be in keeping with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
       character and past performance on economic-administrative matters to have thought up some
       sweeping radical reorganization of economic management or shift in emphasis of allocation of
       resources and to have aired it at the enlarged economic meeting or sometime before as
       something he intended to accomplish at the November plenum. This proposal might have been so
       radical, at least it might have threatened to gore so many oxen that it facilitated
       organization of anti-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> coalition of power in
       Central Committee during <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
       absence on vacation almost immediately after meeting.</p>
                        <p>While a drastic Khrushchevian administrative proposal might have been averted, there is
       some indication that conservatives may have opposed his “consumer
       oriented” line. In this connection, absence in the Pravda October 17 editorial of
       any references to individual or consumer welfare which have been Khrushchevian stock phrases
       may <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0163"/>be significant. Only positive economic
       references may be read as reminders of the grim slogans of an earlier period: construction of
       material-technical basis of communism inseparably linked to Communist education (as opposed
       to material incentives); and the emphasis is on sacrifice and achievements of labor and the
       construction of new enterprises. On other hand, conservative emphasis may simply reflect the
       closing of ranks on most hallowed traditional party grounds as immediate aftermath of palace
       coup and that the initial conservatism may soon give way. This latter thesis would seem to be
       supported by <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s personal
       identification with consumption sector and light industry.</p>
                        <p>Quick and vigorous attack on <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> (which adds
       some new words to lexicon of denunciations) erases any doubt that new leaders determined to
       destroy him and use alleged sins to help justify shifting tactics and explain away continuing
       difficulties over which they may trip. It is surely opening gun in effort to undermine his
       personal popularity and justify removal to population, which particularly necessary if no
       conspicuous changes or improvements become apparent to them. Mirrored against the action
       taken against <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, words of condemnation seem
       to support conclusion (reftel) as to origins and causes. Along with other indications
       discussed above, these bring us again to see his removal as triggered by complex of factors
       of which struggle with Chinese and difficulties with bloc and world CP movement on one hand,
       and internal economic problems and issues on other hand, predominant. Concern over other
       failures or blunders and irritation over Khrushchevian tactics and behavior played additional
       role of greater or lesser importance to the various former colleagues who brought him
       down.</p>

        U.S.-Soviet Relations</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>We can only conjecture as to the significance for U.S.-Soviet relations until we have more
       solid information as to the circumstances and rationale of the event, and until we can
       observe the revised Soviet leadership in action.</p>
                        <p>It seems certain that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has been forced out
       against his will. All indications thus far suggest an orderly transition of power to his top
       lieutenants and long-time associates, <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>,
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>. They probably will share their power with the other members of the
       Party Presidium for at least an interim period. Their new preeminence may be transitory.</p>
                        <p>Of the numerous problems which may have contributed to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s ouster the relatively most critical at the moment is, in
       the context of the Sino-Soviet dispute and the competition for influence in International
       Communism, Soviet relations with bloc parties and key parties outside the bloc. In the short
       term the new regime's probable granting of priority to this problem above others
       argues for the continuance of Soviet policies directed at the gradual improvement of
       U.S.-Soviet relations or as a minimum the avoidance of actions which could severely strain
       those relations. On the other hand, we should expect no early major Soviet initiatives in
       U.S.-Soviet relations.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing assessment is consistent with what we know of the personalities and past
       actions of <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>. None of these
       politically sophisticated individuals is associated with inflexible Stalinist attitudes
       toward the United States. It must be noted, however, that we as yet have no measure of any
       alignments of forces within the Presidium which could condition their policy positions
       vis-á-vis the United States. Should there continue to be serious divergences of
       opinion within the top Party leadership contributing to an atmosphere <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0165"/>of indecision, this would support the maintenance of the status
       quo in U.S.-Soviet relations.</p>

                        <p rend="center">IMPLICATIONS OF <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">KHRUSHCHEV</persName>'S DOWNFALL</p>
                        <p>1. The first public acts of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
       successors were to reassure the Soviet people and the world that they have no intention of
       repudiating fundamental doctrines and policies developed since the 20th Party Congress in
       1956. In one sense, this is hardly surprising, for the policies and programs symbolized by
       de-Stalinization at home and peaceful coexistence abroad represented prudent adjustments to
       post-Stalin realities in both domestic and foreign affairs. But in a higher political sense,
       the public expression of fidelity to the “Leninist line worked out at the 20th and
       22nd Party Congresses,” followed by assurances to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and other foreign governments that Soviet foreign policy will be unchanged,
       commit the new leaders to continue the broad policy lines of the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> era. These pronouncements also serve notice to the Chinese Communists
       that they should have no illusions that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> may now be
       disposed to abandon or compromise the “principled” positions it has
       long defended against Peiping's assaults.</p>
                        <p>2. The announcements that the Central Committee and the Supreme Soviet Presidium had
       “granted” <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s request to be relieved of his duties were clearly
       intended to emphasize that normal constitutional procedures had been scrupulously observed in
       handling the transfer of authority. This, and the invocation of the party congress lines,
       suggest that, in the period immediately ahead, the new leaders will concentrate on
       consolidating their domestic position and refrain <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0166"/>from any major foreign initiatives, both in the contest with Peiping and in relations with
       the West.</p>
                        <p>3. The key to Moscow's policies over the longer term, of course, lies in the
       unanswered question as to what precipitated <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s downfall at this time. As in all major turning points in
       Soviet history, it would be vain to attribute this coup to any single event or issue.
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> unquestionably aroused the resentment and
       enmity of many powerful and ambitious men during the long and eventful period of his
       leadership. There must have been many officials in the upper reaches of the Soviet party and
       administration who strongly believed that some of his policies and innovations were not only
       misguided but reckless and damaging to the long-range interests and strength of the Soviet
       state. These officials were obliged to endure the disruptive effects of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s ill-advised ventures in economic policy
       and organization, many of which were hastily reversed or abandoned. In the foreign policy
       field, there is no question that some of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s colleagues felt that certain of his major ventures
       subjected Soviet security to needless risks for highly dubious objectives and that his
       penchant for bluff and intimidation damaged the nation's prestige and the
       credibility of its basic objectives without yielding significant gains.</p>
                        <p>4. A survey of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s recent
       conduct of Soviet foreign policy and his strategy in dealing with the Chinese, however, leads
       us to believe that there were no differences within the leadership on these questions serious
       enough to have precipitated the move against <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. This does not mean, of course, that the indictment of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s leadership did not include criticisms
       of his handling of foreign ventures, such as the Berlin offensive of 1958–62 and the Cuban
       crisis. But it seems unlikely that charges of failure or ineptitude on specific policies or
       tactics extended to sharp differences over fundamental objectives of long-established Soviet
       policies which are deeply rooted in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s
       national security and political interests.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s downfall, in our view,
       was the product of an accumulation of what might be termed personal-political resentments and
       dissatisfaction with his leadership, combined with a climatic showdown on basic issues of
       economic planning, management and personnel having a direct bearing on the long-term
       structure and direction of the Soviet economy and military posture. The strength of these
       feelings was evident in Pravda's 17 October denunciation of
       “subjectivism and drifting in Communist construction, hare-brained scheming,
       immature bragging and phrase-mongering, commandism,” and intolerable
       “armchair methods, personal decisions, and disregard for the practical experience
       of the masses.”</p>
                        <p>6. The catalyst which appears to have brought these disparate forces and issues to a head
       was <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s attack, culminating in <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0167"/>his late September speech at the Kremlin meeting on a
       new long-term economic plan, on the entrenched economic traditionalism and vested interests
       which he believed had long frustrated his program of economic reform. This attack, in the
       eyes of powerful elements in the party and in the industrial and military establishment,
       threatened to upset the existing balance of influence and resources which these elements, by
       a kind of tacit agreement, were determined to maintain. As Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> noted in September 1963, a stalemate exists among the
       rival claimants to Soviet resources. He viewed the Soviet economy as becoming increasingly
       similar to the American economy in that there is a variety of entrenched interests which
       compete in the allocation of limited resources. In Kohler's view, these rival
       claimants had imposed sharp limitations on any radical departures in economic policy and,
       particularly, on any substantial diversion of resources to the consumer sectors. In his
       judgment, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> at best could only freeze the
       existing structure of allocations and rely on the annual increments in GNP for investments in
       his favorite programs, such as the rapid expansion of the chemical industry.</p>
                        <p>7. In his talks with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and
       Undersecretary <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> in the summer of 1963,
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> indicated that he intended to freeze
       investments in all sectors of the economy other than chemistry and agriculture. However, by
       the late summer of 1964, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> apparently had
       made the critical decision to [go?] far beyond this strategy and to mount a fundamental
       attack on traditional economic doctrine and the existing division of resources. The breaking
       point thus came when, in late September, he made his major bid to break the stalemate and to
       force through a definitive reorientation and overhaul of the economy in which the
       “main task” would be to ensure a “more rapid development of
       the consumers goods industry.” In contrast with this unequivocal demand for
       preferential development of consumer industries, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had assured the Central Committee plenum last February that consumer
       requirements would continue to bow to defense needs in line with traditional policy. The
       thrust of the late September speech, however, strongly implied that defense priorities would
       be downgraded indefinitely under the new long-term plan. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> also asserted that traditionally defense-oriented heavy industries
       must increasingly contribute to consumer production. The first concrete manifestation of this
       new direction appeared in the party-government decree of 5 September which outlined <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s program for accelerating poultry
       production and designated the State Committee for Aviation Technology to organize the
       necessary production of machines and equipment.</p>
                        <p>8. In addition to this demand for a major reorientation in economic priorities, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> may have been planning other far-reaching actions at
       the Central Committee meeting scheduled for some time in <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140" facs="0168"/>November and at the semi-annual Supreme Soviet session anticipated in December.
       These may have included important personnel changes in the party and administration. This is
       an area in which he apparently had temporized for a long period. The large accumulation of
       “dead wood” at high levels has long been obvious. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, moreover, has frequently complained about
       obstructionists and bureaucrats, although these remarks probably were not aimed at members of
       the top leadership. Within the party presidium, however, there are a number of aging, sickly,
       or apparently ineffective members. Fear of being ousted from places of authority and
       privilege may well have been one of the factors that forged the anti-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> alliance.</p>
                        <p>9. If these were, in fact, some of the considerations which precipitated <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s downfall, it seems likely that his
       successors will be inclined to pursue a cautious domestic policy of consolidation and status
       quo, avoiding any challenge to entrenched interests and the existing balance of internal
       power and resources. It also seems unlikely that there will be any sharp departures in other
       areas of domestic policy, such as regime attitude toward the intelligentsia. The new leaders
       probably will develop their initial gestures to reassure the Soviet people that they need
       have no fear of any reversion to more repressive policies.</p>
                        <p>10. It is difficult to see how the changeover in Moscow could produce any basic change in
       attitude toward China. It is possible that the new leaders, in the initial period of
       consolidation, may wish to revert to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s pre-1963 policy of temporizing in order to avert a formal
       schism in the Communist movement. But it seems unlikely, particularly in the aftermath of
       China's successful nuclear detonation, that the Peiping leaders would accommodate
       the Russians on such an option. The new regime probably will find their hands forced by the
       Chinese and that they will be no more able to temporize than was <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                        <p>11. The Chinese have not confined their assaults to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> himself but have denounced his entire “clique.”
       There is no reason to believe that <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> and
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> may be disposed to try to work toward a
       reconciliation. In his speech in East Germany on 6 October, <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> attacked the “splitting policy of those who—for
       the sake of their chauvinist aims—try to divide, to undermine the unity of the
       socialist countries” and he specifically endorsed the “impending
       international forum of Communists"—presumably a reference to the December
       preparatory meeting. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was less direct in his 3
       October speech on the 15th anniversary of East Germany, denouncing the “absurd
       theories of the contemporary left-wing opportunists who advocate the establishment of
       isolated national economies” and restrict economic contacts between socialist
       countries.</p>
                        <pb n="141" xml:id="pg_141" facs="0169"/>
                        <p>12. Although it is possible that the new leaders questioned the wisdom of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s moves to bring the conflict with
       Peiping to a head, it is doubtful that they would be willing to accept the political costs of
       deferring or abandoning proposals for a preparatory meeting and for a full-scale conference
       next year. The Pravda article of 17 October stated specifically that “our party,
       as hitherto, will pursue an active line for the convocation of an international meeting of
       all Communist parties to discuss topical problems of the struggle for peace … and
       for the consolidation of the unity of the Communist movement on the immutable principles of
       proletarian internationalism.” <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s successors must expect the Chinese to exploit his
       downfall as a repudiation of his stand in the Sino-Soviet conflict. [<hi rend="italic">1 line
        of source text not declassified</hi>] sources close to the Chinese government regard Moscow
       developments as a “big victory” and believe the December meeting
       “inevitably” will be postponed.</p>

                        <p>1183. While ouster of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was sudden and
       complete with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> overnight becoming unperson
       in best Communist tradition, we should not assume that present installation is a stable one,
       nor that jockeying for position among power contenders will not soon become apparent. The
       successive steps in the removal process reveal some notable developments in the system
       relating to the method of rule and process of changing leadership which would tend support
       idea that what we have seen is perhaps only first of a series of moves, exact nature and
       intensity of which at moment unpredictable. The experience of and precedents established by
       the 1957 ouster of the “anti-party” group and the principles of rule
       touted in the de-Stalinization campaign have had their impact and were reflected in the
       current crisis in the leadership. Paradoxically, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was the prime mover of both these events and, therefore, planted the
       seeds which eventually facilitated his own fall.</p>
                        <p>In reflecting on <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s ouster in
       the context of the pattern of rule since Stalin's death, the following points
       emerge:</p>
                        <pb n="142" xml:id="pg_142" facs="0170"/>
                        <p>First, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> himself established principle that
       the party's Central Committee is a custodian of legitimacy, although its
       policy-making role remains limited. In 1957 a majority of the Presidium attempted to unseat
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and were outmaneuvered by the
       latter's summoning of the Central Committee and military backing to support him.
       This experience was not forgotten by the other leaders on this occasion (as well as in the
       shake-up of May 1960) and an advance sounding out of the key figures and provincial party
       bosses who are members of the Central Committee undoubtedly was completed before Presidium
       members initiated their removal action. While the vote in the Central Committee then became a
       perfunctory rubberstamp of a Presidium decision, the legitimizing role of the Central
       Committee has been further institutionalized.</p>
                        <p>Second, the power to initiate such a removal action, on the other hand, as well as the
       basic policymaking power remains concentrated in the hands of the dozen or so Presidium
       members. While the Presidium now is constrained to legitimize major personnel shift with
       Central Committee endorsement, such endorsement of policymaking moves is not so apparent.
       Central Committee discussion of policy in its plenums in the last five years or so has
       increasingly become a mass gathering of members of the Central Committee plus many
       non-members, convoked to listen to a series of non-controversial speeches followed by
       approval of a prepared resolution. There are still many decisions issued in the name of the
       Central Committee without the convoking of a plenum.</p>
                        <p>Third, there is a certain encouragement of conspiracy in present leadership arrangement.
       The role of the First Secretary is not always the all-powerful one that Stalin had made it
       and the situation develops at certain points (and may continue to in the future) where the
       next ranking secretary can acquire the power and prerogatives to engineer the overthrow of
       the top leader. It became obvious in the successive cases of Kirichenko and Kozlov that
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had to delegate and entrust powers to the
       next subordinate and each aggrandized his authority thereby. The significant factor in
        <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s case is the speed with which he
       was able after only a few months as a fulltime secretary to line up the Presidium members to
       support the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> ouster (although we have heard
       Mikoyan initially spoke out against the drastic action contemplated-which, if true, may bode
       ill for Mikoyan), probably almost unanimously.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>, of course, now becomes subject to same
       pitfalls as <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. As First Secretary he is in a
       stronger position than other leaders to perpetuate his power for the near future, but it is
       still at the behest of the Presidium. If he aspires to wear two hats as First Secretary and
       Premier in the future (as he probably must in conformity with <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0171"/>the power pattern set by his predecessors) he will have to worry even more
       about the conspiratorial activities which the next subordinate Party Secretary will be able
       to mount against him. A reversion to repressive action to preserve his position may only
       bring him down more surely in the end or convulse Soviet society.</p>
                        <p>Fourth, for all of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s opening
       up of informational channels to the Soviet public and his use and manipulation of public
       opinion by grassroots tours and public appeals, no ground swell of public reaction has yet
       been apparent on his behalf. Thus far the precipitate action has evoked less popular reaction
       than that of Stalin, Beriya and the anti-party group (this may, of course, be a function of
       the almost total lack of support among the apparatchiks for <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s mode of rule). Again, paradoxically, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is the victim whose ouster demonstrates the
       correctness of his apparent belief that a great deal more relaxation and license could be
       granted Soviet society without a resultant significant increase in its political
       participation or role which would jeopardize the party's political monopoly.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, the affair is not ended. As indicated in Embtel 1178<note n="2" xml:id="d60fn2">Dated October 17, it reported that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> over
        the past year seemed to be grooming Podgorny as his successor at the expense of Brezhnev.
        (Ibid.)</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s power is limited and collective
       leadership of the Presidium is the dominant feature of the regime at this moment. This
       collectively solidified in recent months although its origins probably go back as far as 1960
       at least, at the time of the U–2 incident, and was augmented sporadically in the following
       years by successive failures of foreign and internal policies, which swayed individual
       leaders in their loyalty to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. The ambitions
       and views of various leaders, however, will eventually break this calm of collectivity. The
       role of Podgorny, who was the most obvious of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s favorites in the past year, is unclear and unless he
       soon falls in the wake of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, he may represent
       a curb and even a threat to the power of <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> in
       the future. Similarly, other leaders, some of a younger generation, are undoubtedly waiting
       to find their opening to increase their personal role in the post-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> rearrangement of power. Polyansky, who reportedly also spoke at the
       Central Committee meeting on <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
       agricultural failures, could be a strong contender for either a party secretaryship or
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s job. In the background are also
       Voronov, the <gloss target="#t_RSFSR1">RSFSR</gloss> Premier, Kirilenko, the virtual boss at
       present of the <gloss target="#t_RSFSR1">RSFSR</gloss> Party apparatus, and candidate
       Presidium members and lesser party secretaries such as Yefremov, Polyakov and Andropov whose
       stature has been rising in the past few years. In sum, the arrangement of the top leaders
       devised for the near future is not necessarily permanent and is only the reflection of the
       present collective leadership which will erode <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0172"/>as
       the dynamic of Presidium politics begins to operate again and as the immediate need for
       closing of ranks recedes in importance.</p>

                        <p rend="center">BRIEFING BY AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">THOMPSON</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>We have had cables now from our Embassies in all of the principal capitals and all of our
       Allies seem to be in agreement with us on what we know and don't know about what
       has happened.</p>
                        <p>I think we are all agreed that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was forced
       out and that health and age was not the real reason for his removal. There are a number of
       things which support this. One of them is the fact that they announced that they had put him
       off the Presidium of the Central Committee. Kozlov has been off with a heart attack for many
       months and he is still a member and there was no reason to kick <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> out if his removal had not been forced.</p>
                        <p>We have, of course, known for a long time that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s style of leadership was bothering his other colleagues
       and we think that that is probably the basic cause for his removal, although obviously some
       particular issue must have triggered it at this particular time. One thing that supports this
       thesis was the Pravda editorial which came out a few days ago. Without mentioning him by
       name, it listed his faults. It accused him of subjectivism, drifting in communist
       construction, hare-brained scheming, immature conclusions and hasty decisions and actions
       divorced from reality, bragging and phrasemongering, commandism and unwillingness to take
       account of the achievements of science and practical experience, using armchair methods,
       personal decisions, disregard for practical experience of the masses and finally the <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0173"/>practice of personality cult. All of those with the
       possible exception of the mention of science are about method rather than substance, so it
       leads us to believe that this was the main thing that was bothering them. What triggered it
       at this time, so far we have no clues. It is rather curious because <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was himself obviously surprised. He was seen by
       Palewski the day before and told him he was leaving suddenly for Moscow but it was presumed
       it was because of the cosmonauts. <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> was in
       Germany for the Fifteenth Anniversary celebration during the preceding week. This is rather
       curious for if they had been planning it one would have thought <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> would have been there. There must be something we don't know
       that kicked this off.</p>
                        <p>There have been a whole series of controversial issues being debated in the Soviet Union
       and this could have been kicked off by any one of them. The two main ones I would think were
       the problems related to the disintegration of the Communist Bloc and particularly their
       quarrel with Red China. The Italians came out and published the Tagliatti memorandum, a sort
       of declaration of independence. The French Communist Party made a similar statement.
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had gotten himself in a box by insisting
       on going ahead with the meeting of Communist Parties in December, which was going to lead to
       a complete break with the Chinese Party. This was opposed by a number of the Communist
       Parties in Eastern Europe and this change in leadership at least will now give them some
       maneuverability if they want to pursue a different policy. They have announced they are in
       favor of a conference but in a different context because the personal quarrel between Mao and
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is eliminated.</p>
                        <p>The other set of issues that we think was probably the most serious that they were facing
       were those that are related to the allocation of resources. There has been a fight going on
       about this; what it amounts to is who gets the big appropriations. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> made a speech in late September at a meeting to
       which had been called people from all over the Soviet Union in which he said that they had
       enough military strength now and had built up their basic industry so that they could now
       afford to expand the consumer goods industry. This is a policy which the Soviet military have
       long opposed as well as the people interested in heavy industry and it certainly would gain
       military support for his removal if they thought he was going to press this very far. Related
       to this is the question of military strategy in general. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, for a number of years, has said that in an atomic age it
       doesn't make sense to have large conventional armies and air forces and navies and
       some years ago he announced a cutback in military forces of about a million and a half men.
       He told me personally at the time that he had to use all of his authority to get it across.
       Later on they dropped it because of the buildup in the Berlin crisis. Certainly the speeches
       and articles that have been written by military men in the <pb n="146" xml:id="pg_146" facs="0174"/>Soviet Union show that there has been a real division among the military
       opposing reliance on military missiles rather than conventional forces.</p>
                        <p>There are also other issues that could have been involved. One is the German problem. The
       fact that <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> was in Germany might have been
       indicative. The Germans were disturbed about <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s trip to Bonn. There was this rather mysterious attack on
       a West German diplomatic officer in Moscow with mustard gas which in some quarters was
       interpreted as an attempt on somebody's part to disrupt the prospect of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s trip and there was a good deal of talk
       that he shouldn't come until it was satisfactorily explained. Before this change
       in Moscow took place, the Russians gave the Germans a conciliatory note. Another issue that
       could have been involved was the Cuban issue because Dorticos the President of Cuba was in
       Moscow at the time, although we think it is unlikely that this could have been the kind of
       thing to cause this change.</p>
                        <p>There are a lot of other things in which there is disagreement. Foreign aid is one of them.
       Lots of people don't think they should be giving aid to bourgeois governments. The
       Chinese have been criticizing them for this. There has also been a question there about the
       wisdom of spending so much money on space. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
       spoke to me about this once and showed he was well aware how much it was costing and he is
       interested in their economy.</p>
                        <p>It is rather interesting that there are several major divisions in the Soviet Union. One of
       the political ones has always been between Leningraders and Ukrainians. Each of these men
       come from a different part. <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> is Ukrainian and
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> comes from Leningrad. There is also a more
       important division between the Communist Party professionals and the government bureaucrats
       which in the Soviet Union means all of industry as well as governmental functions. Brezhnev
       is the Party man and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> is mainly an
       industrialist. He came up there in the light industry side of their economy. He was at one
       time head of their planning commission and would tend to be more interested in these problems
       so they have kept a balance in both of these things by naming these two men.</p>
                        <p>As far as these two men are concerned, I have had many talks with both, particularly
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. They are, I think, very able administrators
       but neither of them is the type of man I would think would become a strong leader the way
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was so it seems quite possible that
       somebody else will eventually get power the way <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> did. There are other strong figures in the Presidium, one of which
       might eventually come forward. We would expect these people to follow a rather more cautious
       policy. One of the attributes of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that
       disturbed us as well as his own colleagues was his impulsiveness <pb n="147" xml:id="pg_147" facs="0175"/>and tendency to launch into ventures without thinking them through. We think
       these people would be less inclined to do this particularly as they are less firmly in power.
       I would also think they are apt to follow a more orthodox Communist line. I don't
       think they have the imagination <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had. He is
       a pragmatic fellow and I think these men will be less inclined to deviate from the standard
       Communist line. One of the things we will be following more closely is how this is going to
       affect their relations with China. It is reported, but not confirmed, that <persName corresp="#p_SMA1">Suslov</persName> presented the charges against <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. When the Soviets were having their negotiations
       with the Chinese, they had two sets of them. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had <persName corresp="#p_SMA1">Suslov</persName> and Kozlov handle
       them and it would seem likely that they would take the positions <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> took and are pretty well tagged with them. <persName corresp="#p_SMA1">Suslov</persName> is their top theoretician and is mainly interested in
       relations with other Communist parties and because of that and the fact that they are losing
       control of these parties in Eastern Europe we would think that he would want to moderate the
       quarrel with China; but, basically, as an ideologist he would want to stick with the
       positions he has already taken. We will have to wait and see. They have already announced
       that they still advocate a meeting of the Communist parties but with the object of unity
       rather than apparently what <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was going to
       do; that is, force the break.</p>
                        <p>I think they have begun to realize what this quarrel was costing them. In meetings of front
       organizations the Chinese were coming in and making shambles of them. It almost pays them not
       to meet rather than have public quarrels.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, the Soviet Ambassador, came in and
       told the President<note n="2" xml:id="d61fn2">See <ref target="#d55">Document
        55</ref>.</note> that their basic foreign policy was going to be unchanged and they have
       done the same thing in other foreign capitals around the world. We don't know if
       its true. He mentioned foreign policy would be based on the XX, XXI, and XXII Party
       Congresses and explained it meant consolidating peace, relaxation of tensions, developing
       peaceful coexistence. I would think myself that their primary concern now will be first of
       all to consolidate their position in the Soviet Union, deal with some of these internal
       problems; two, to address themselves to the problems of the Communist Bloc and only in the
       third category to deal with foreign affairs. In any event, toward the last three or four
       months they have been on dead center so far as the West is concerned. They were waiting for
       the British and American elections and were showing no disposition to want to tackle any
       important problems. The President, when he saw Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, gave him an excellent and strong presentation of our policy which
       could be summarized with the p<pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0176"/>hrase his guard is up
       but his hand is out. He emphasized flexibility on their part and particularly with the coming
       problem in the United Nations—Article 19—but the Ambassador had
       obviously no instructions other than this little piece which he had said, and all he did was
       to listen.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">KHRUSHCHEV</persName>'S FALL AND ITS CONSEQUENCES</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Grievances</p>
                        <p>1. The official complaints against <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s style of leadership clearly have great substance. If this
       were all, however, the result would be irritation, not a coup. Given the man's
       incessant initiatives, opposition must have coalesced around the need to thwart his current
       projects. Even so, it could only succeed because so many of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s policies had both injured or upset every important group
       in Soviet politics and produced a long record of failures.</p>
                        <p>2. One immediate cause was probably the raising of the long-contested question of economic
       priorities. There are indications that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in
       late September made a major bid to break the stalemate on this issue. The abridged account of
       his speech claimed that “now when we have a powerful industry” and
       defense “is at its proper level,” the “main task
       …is the further raising of the people's standard of living.”
       He may have given notice that he meant to press a decision at the November plenum. When he
       thereupon left for Sochi, his colleagues, who had long resisted him on this matter,
       apparently decided that cause and opportunity conspired.</p>
                        <p>3. Another immediate cause probably was <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s handling of the split in the Communist movement. It
       seemed clear that, in pressing for the 15 December meeting which was to prepare for a world
       Communist conference, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was heading for
       another failure: a number of demonstratively empty chairs and further concessions to <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0177"/>those who seek a loosening of international discipline,
       with no palpable gains against China. His successors can hardly have a different basic
       attitude to Peiping, but a tactical change probably seemed necessary.</p>
                        <p>4. We know of no equally tense issues in relations with the West, but it is possible that
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s handling of the German
       question contributed to his downfall. The early 1965 visit to Bonn, with its hint of a new
       German policy, was clearly disquieting to the East Germans (and Chinese attempts to play on
       Ulbricht's fears confirm this). Reservations were reinforced by
       Adzhubei's deliberate indiscretions about Ulbricht's health.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Opposition</p>
                        <p>5. Deposing <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> must have required a heavy
       Presidium majority and, below that level, a broad anti-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> consensus. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s repeated reorganizations had given offense to both the
       party and state apparatuses. He kept the military constantly busy coping with his attempts to
       hold down defense spending and shift funds from the ground forces to the missions of
       strategic attack and defense. His successors' early endorsements of military
       priorities suggest the way in which the marshals were enlisted, or at least neutralized. It
       was also necessary at least to neutralize the police.</p>
                        <p>6. Soviet succession politics is inherently unstable. In the present case, some of the
       specifics are:</p>
                        <p>a. The <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> team is not merely a duumvirate of personalities, but a combination of
       two bureaucracies—party and state—with a history of conflict. It is
       possible to interpret some of the postcoup evidence as reflecting, already, the beginnings of
       personal competition.</p>
                        <p>b. Podgorny is a potent rival to <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> in the
       party apparat.</p>
                        <p>c. In the filling of vacancies, the impulse to factionalism is practically irresistible.
       Replacements are needed now for those who may have fallen with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> (apparently a small group so far) and for the unlucky Marshal
       Biryuzov and General Mironov,<note n="2" xml:id="d62fn2">Major General Mironov, a veteran
        secret police official who had close ties to <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>, was the chief of the watch dog department in the party apparatus

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Consequences</p>
                        <p>8. In formulating policy over the next several months, and in the years ahead, the new
       leaders face a wide set of policy problems which have not been eased by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s fall.</p>
                        <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Internal Affairs</hi>: The complaints about <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s style of rule, together with the
       character of his successors, suggest a return to a less impulsive, more cautious approach.
       Some in the new leadership, such as <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, may wish
       to concentrate on regularizing administrative procedures; others, such as <persName corresp="#p_SMA1">Suslov</persName> may seek to give policies a greater ideological cast;
        <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s initial statements exalt the
       role of the party. The question of how fast and how far to pursue de-Stalinization, and now
       “de-Khrushchevization” as well, may not yet be resolved. But there will
       probably be strong pressures from within the regime for caution concerning the Stalin
       question (and this could spell cooler weather ahead for the intellectual dissidents), and
       there has already been considerable pressure from other Communist parties for caution in
       handling <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s record.</p>
                        <p>10. The major question affecting the economy is the future division of resources between
       defense and defense-associated industries on the one hand, and agriculture and consumer goods
       on the other. There are some clues that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s programs for the chemical industry and agriculture may
       lose some of their “crash” nature. In the main, however, it seems
       likely that the present pattern of allocations will be frozen for a time. Thus the main
       problems of the Soviet economy will continue unsolved. A year hence, the record of economic
       performance may move some politician to return to something akin to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s initiatives.</p>
                        <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Eastern Europe</hi>: It is in this area that major consequences have
       already registered themselves, and they are negative. Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and
       East Germany have praised <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
       merits instead of following the Soviet line on his failings. East European leaders are simply
       unwilling to weaken their domestic positions by repudiating their established line at the
       behest of a Soviet leadership which—who knows?—may itself be
       short-lived. These reactions serve notice that they will resist any Soviet efforts to reverse
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s relatively liberal policy in
       this area. The impulse to look to national interest has received powerful encouragement.</p>
                        <p>12. The reaction from Western Communists has been analogous but even more explicit. Several
       parties have ostentatiously dissociated themselves from the decision and demanded a full
       public explanation. Further losses in Soviet authority seem inevitable, and some of these
       losses will also be Chinese gains.</p>
                        <p>13. <hi rend="italic">China and the Communist Movement</hi>: Whether to proceed as planned
       with the 15 December meeting poses an acute tactical question <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0179"/>to the new leaders. Many important pro-Soviet parties have not favored this
       meeting because it seemed certain to aggravate the split. The Soviets now may modify the
       terms of the meeting, defer it, or leave it open while seeking bilateral talks with the
       Chinese. Meanwhile, there probably will be some moderation of polemics.</p>
                        <p>14. Beyond this, the successors have little room for maneuver. The removal of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, plus the Chinese atomic feat, practically ensure
       that any substantial rapprochement would be on Mao's terms. Both sides are wary
       and quiet at present, but the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is at a tactical
       disadvantage because China can afford to wait and to make large demands.</p>
                        <p>15. <hi rend="italic">The Neutrals</hi>: <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
       personified the Soviet policy of cultivating the nonaligned, and his successors have had to
       move quickly in confirming his commitments. It will take time (and money) to overcome the
       nervousness of these countries and repair their confidence. Meanwhile, any suggestion of
       reneging will be costly, and this will give the new regime extra incentive to sustain its
       support of, for example, Indonesia and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>16. <hi rend="italic">The West</hi>: Peaceful coexistence has been reaffirmed, and indeed
       the factors which commend tactics of détente—strategic inferiority,
       economic faltering, the dispute with China—have not lost force. Some of specific
       consequences may be:</p>
                        <p>a. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, pleading a new government, can probably get
       increased support for postponing any showdown in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on the
       Article 19 issue which confronts the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> with the loss of
       its vote in the General Assembly because of Moscow's refusal to pay peacekeeping
       costs.</p>
                        <p>b. On the Cuban overflight issue, the successors are in a somewhat poorer position to
       resist Castro if he urges a showdown. But they are also in a somewhat poorer position to take
       on the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in an early crisis. There is a good chance that
       Castro will be less inclined to press the matter soon; he will need time to convince himself
       that the Soviet commitment is unaltered.</p>
                        <p>c. There are no strong reasons to expect a change in Soviet policy in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>d. Policy toward Germany will probably be immobile. It is worth remembering for the longer
       run, however, that an alternative German policy probably was developed (by Beriya) in the
       last succession struggle, and that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> may have
       had in mind a shift here which, at least to his colleagues and to Ulbricht, seemed risky.
       Further, the likely trend in Eastern Europe will sharpen the contradictions in the
       traditional Soviet position on Germany.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusion</p>
                        <p>17. Factionalism in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has a way of hurting the
       Soviet state. De-Stalinization is a case in point; <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s secret speech was in great part a blow against his
       rivals, but the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is still paying for its <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152" facs="0180"/>larger consequences. The present display of the uglier side of
       Kremlin politics has weakened party prestige at home and Soviet prestige abroad. It has set
       internal politics on an unfruitful course which stores up future troubles. It has produced
       another lurch westward in Eastern Europe. It has played into Chinese hands. It has provoked
       second thoughts among many Soviet friends and clients abroad. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s departure may remove a certain disorderly and erratic
       quality from Soviet policy-making, but at the expense of losing the dynamism of his personal
       leadership. All in all, his ouster may prove to be a costly move for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>18. For the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, the meaning of the change is uncertain.
       Within the limits imposed by the world relation of forces, the new men and their jockeying
       for power could move Soviet policy in directions that would be either less troublesome or
       more dangerous to the West.</p>

                        <p>1267. I called on <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> at 1130 this morning and
       had 35 minute talk with him. I was accompanied by Toon. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was attended by an unidentified aide and Vinogradov as interpreter.
        (<persName corresp="#p_TOA1">Troyanovsky</persName> met us in outer office, thus presumably
       putting end to speculation as to his downfall with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.)</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> I deeply appreciated opportunity he
       had accorded me to pay my respects and again convey my personal congratulations to him on his
       designation as Premier since I recognized that at this time he must have a very busy
       schedule. As he was aware the President had been pleased that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had called on him<note n="2" xml:id="d63fn2">See <ref target="#d55">Document 55</ref>.</note> promptly after change in Soviet Government and was glad to
       receive the message through <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that the new
       government intended to follow previous policies especially those affecting bilateral
       relations between <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Soviet Union. I felt sure <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had reported in detail on his meeting with the
       President and if <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> now had anything further to
       say <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0181"/>with regard to govt change and to policies of
       Soviet Government, I should be glad to convey any message he might have to Washington.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said he would ask me to transmit his personal
       deep gratitude for the congratulatory message from the President<note n="3" xml:id="d63fn3">Transmitted in telegram 1139, October 17, it reads: “I extend greetings to you
        on your designation as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Union of Soviet Socialist
        Republics. Our countries bear heavy responsibilities for the maintenance of world peace. It
        is my hope that our governments will work constructively in attempting to resolve the urgent
        international problems facing us and the world.” (Johnson Library, National
        Security File, Country File, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, Vol. VI)</note> and to
       reassure him as <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had indicated in his first
       meeting with the President and as has been expressed in public statements in Moscow the
       Soviet Government contemplates no changes in its internal and international policies. The
       government would remain the same except for the fact that the former Chairman of the Council
       of Ministers had retired.</p>
                        <p>I commented that we had noted with satisfaction the public statements by the new Soviet
       Government to which <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had referred particularly
       the speeches by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> himself as well as
        <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Continuing, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that the basic line which
       the new government intended to follow was the line laid down at the 20th, 21st and 22nd Party
       Congresses. All in Central Committee and government staunchly support the principles of
       peaceful coexistence with states of different social systems and do not contemplate any
       change in this policy. Furthermore, new government hopes to preserve all existing channels of
       communications with President Johnson and would like to continue friendly and confidential
       conversations if this is also the wish of the President. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> felt that in current world context system of our relations is not a bad
       one and he hoped it would be continued.</p>
                        <p>I said I was sure that President shared <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s view on need and desirability maintaining existing channels
       of communications and as President had already indicated to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, was gratified that new government intended continue previous policies,
       especially those affecting our two countries which we had found mutually useful. I personally
       considered it my duty as well as a privilege to report accurately and sympathetically on
       Soviet Government's attitudes with a view toward improvement our mutual relations.
       I was devoted to the concept, I had worked assiduously toward this aim and would continue to
       do so.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said he was glad to hear this and he would
       welcome any continued efforts in this direction. He felt we were engaged in a number of
       useful pursuits in the mutual interests of our two countries and he hoped that we would
       continue our efforts and contacts toward this end.</p>
                        <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0182"/>
                        <p>Recognizing that he was preoccupied with a number of pressing problems at present time I
       said that I did not wish to discuss any substantive problems in detail at this meeting. I
       felt he should know, however, that the President and Secretary of State wished me to return
       to the United States for consultation after the elections and I hoped before then to have a
       substantive talk with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and
       perhaps with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> himself on specific issues.
       Meanwhile, I would like briefly to refer to a major and topical problem which had been
       discussed by the President with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and
       subsequently by the Secretary of State and Stevenson with the Soviet Ambassador. This problem
       related to the question of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> arrearages.<note n="4" xml:id="d63fn4">See <ref target="#d42fn2">footnote 2, Document 42</ref>.</note> I wished to
       reaffirm to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> that while there are differences
       between us on this question my government does not regard the question as a Cold War issue
       between our two countries and hopes sincerely that the Soviet Government will re-examine the
       problem in the light of their stated intention to strengthen the United Nations. It was our
       sincere desire to help resolve the problem before the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> meets
       in order to avoid a sharpening of our conflicting views in the early days of our two new
       administrations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that the Soviet Government's
       point of view on this issue remains unchanged. With regard to expenses of the Congo
       operation, he wished emphasize that Soviets did not participate “in this
       war” and they would not pay any assessments in connection with it. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> hoped we would give serious thought to possible ways
       out of impasse. Meanwhile, he wished point out that whatever our motivation might have been,
       it was we who raised the matter in such “acute and active” way. Soviet
       Government did not understand, saw no logic in and were puzzled as to purpose of our actions.
       What did we intend to accomplish by posing problem in this way? Is purpose to force <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> out of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>? <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> personally doubted this. In any case, he wished to make
       crystal clear that Soviet Government attitude on this is matter of deep principle which they
       intended to defend to end.</p>
                        <p>I said I did not wish to enter into a detailed discussion of issue but I felt I should
       clarify one point. We had not taken any initiative to raise this question; the question
       arises automatically in accordance with Articles 17 and 19 of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> would recall that the
       General Assembly had endorsed Congo operation through five resolutions four of which the
       Soviet Union had voted for. We felt strongly—also on grounds of
       principle—that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would be finished, would no
       longer be a viable institution if members should be permitted to choose assessments which
       they were prepared to pay. The initiative we did take was to enter into discussions with
       Soviet representatives in order <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0183"/>to attempt to find
       way to prevent problem from coming to a head. I reiterated that our purpose was simply to
       preserve the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter and in no sense was our action
       directed deliberately against the Soviet Union or any other country. Our position thus was a
        pro-<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> position, not an anti-Soviet position. I felt strongly
       that we and the Soviets had a shared interest in maintaining the strength of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> through preserving the Charter as well as <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> financial stability. In no sense did we seek to embarrass the Soviet Government
       by our position on the Article 19 issue and if the Soviet Government could find some way to
       strengthen the financial stability of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> while at same
       time maintaining their political position, we would, of course, be glad to cooperate in their
       efforts.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said he too did not wish to be drawn into a
       detailed discussion of this issue at this meeting, but he felt I should understand clearly
       that Soviet Government maintains unchanged its previous position. The war waged in the Congo
       was not the Soviet Government's idea, it was not popular with the Soviet people
       and the Soviet Government is not going to pay for any expenses in connection with Congo
       operations. With regard to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> itself, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> could assure me that the Soviets were prepared to spare
       no efforts and use all possible means to preserve the institution and to facilitate
       cooperation among states within the framework of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
       Charter. He must emphasize again that the Soviet Government's position on the
       Article 19 issue is shared by “all here” and represents the interests
       of other states as well.</p>
                        <p>I apologized for raising the question at this meeting but explained that both the President
       and Secretary of State felt deeply that our position should not be misunderstood by the
       Soviet Government. Specifically, I wished <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> to
       understand that we did not regard the problem as a Cold War issue, our position was not
       anti-Soviet. I felt it important to clarify this point in view of <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s remarks which could be interpreted as questioning our
       motivation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> assumed that we would each draw our own
       conclusions from the conversation. He felt I would agree that the question tended to
       aggravate our relations and he personally failed to understand why we had raised the problem
       in such a “sharp” way. For this he felt we must assume full
       responsibility.</p>
                        <p>I said I could not accept this charge.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that while perhaps I could not agree we
       were at fault, I would recognize that each side regards the issue from its own point of view.
       I would perhaps also agree that if we changed positions with the Soviet Union we would take
       the same attitude as they.</p>
                        <p>I said I would simply restate my hope that we could resolve problem before it came to a
       head. Meanwhile, leaving this problem aside, I would hope to do everything possible to
       advance good relations between <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0184"/>our two countries and
       toward this end I would always be at disposal Kosygin in order convey his wishes and receive
       his advice. In concluding conversation Kosygin noted that President at present time is deeply
       preoccupied with electoral campaign. He and all his colleagues wished him every success in
       the hard and arduous task which lies ahead of him; this was not simply <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s personal view but the view of the entire
       collective leadership of the Soviet Union—the Central Committee and the Council of
       Ministers. He hoped that the Soviet's Nov 7 holiday would also be cause for
       celebration of the President's victory and the President's personal
       holiday would coincide with the Soviet national day.<note n="5" xml:id="d63fn5">With his
        Presidential campaign in mind, the President proposed in a telephone conversation with
        McGeorge Bundy on October 27 that Bundy “blow up” Kohler's
        October 23 visit with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> by saying that
         <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> called in the U.S. Ambassador and notified
        the President that there would be no change in policy and that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was “communicating with us” and
        “courting us"—“it puts us on a little different level from
        Barry [Goldwater].” (Johnson Library, Recordings and Transcripts, Recording of a
        Telephone Conversation between the President and Bundy, 1:59 p.m., Tape 6410.13, PNO 24) In
        a campaign speech in Salt Lake City on October 29, the President noted that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had informed him “this week”
        that the Soviet Union “would maintain its present policies” and would
        “continue its communication with the United States.” For text, see
        Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.

                        <p>I said I would be pleased to transmit <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s wishes to the President and I was sure he would be glad to
       receive them.<note n="6" xml:id="d63fn6">In telegram 1268, October 23, <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> commented that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> “habitually looks worn and morose” and that he
        did at their meeting, although he was affable and friendly throughout it. In commenting
        further the Ambassador said there would be no “freewheeling by the new Soviet
        leaders, and they would avoid in both public and private statements any remarks that did not
        accord precisely with the view of the new collective leadership.” (National

        Smyth had invited V. S. Emelyanov, Soviet Representative to the International Atomic Energy
        Agency, to come up to his room to discuss the recent events in Moscow. (Ibid.)</note>
       Conversation with Emelyanov Oct 24, 1964.</p>
                        <p>Pursuant to the brief talk with Emelyanov on Oct 19 already reported I asked him whether we
       could continue and he agreed to come to my room at The Imperial Saturday morning. He came
       about 10:00 and talked for about two hours. In making the appointment he had said that he
       would speak for my ears alone therefore I didn't feel I could take notes. At the
       end of our conversation I pointed out that much of what he had said would be of interest to
       my colleagues. He replied as long as nothing he said was given to the news media he had no
       objection, in fact felt it desirable that responsible officials should know what had
       happened. It is essential that the source of my information be protected for the sake of
       future relations. I have every reason to believe that what he said was honest reporting of
       facts observed or beliefs held.</p>
                        <p>The talk was roughly in two parts, the first having to do with the Chinese bomb, Indian
       activities and intentions and related subjects. The second part a specific account of recent
       events in Moscow.</p>
                        <p>Most of the material in the first part was familiar and need not be reported.</p>
                        <p>As to the Chinese bomb he did not pretend to know much. In fact he was assuming that it was
       a plutonium bomb and apparently had not seen <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> press reports
       that it was U–235. He spoke at considerable length of the concentration of Chinese scientists
       in China made up of senior men trained in Europe or the USA and younger men many of whom were
       trained in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>He stated that the Russian scientists in China before the break in relations were aware
       that there was a major installation to which they did not have access.</p>
                        <p>On the whole he appeared to have little or no direct knowledge of the Chinese affair. He
       has not been there.</p>
                        <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0186"/>
                        <p>On the events in Moscow recently his account was approximately as follows:</p>
                        <p>He had been having some disagreements over many months with Petrosyants, his nominal boss,
       and concluded he had to clarify his position. Therefore shortly after his return to Moscow
       from the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> general conference (probably Sept 25 or later)
       he had attempted to see <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> who is a friend of
       his. This he found impossible since <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> was
       continually reported out of his office or busy.</p>
                        <p>This became understandable when one afternoon late (presumably Tuesday, Oct 13) Emelyanov
       got word that the Central Committee was to meet at six o'clock. Emelyanov went and
       found the whole Committee assembled (three categories, he belongs to the middle category,
       candidate member). After they had all gathered there were still several chairs vacant which
       were then filled by the leaders coming in led by <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> and including <persName corresp="#p_SMA1">Suslov</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and a
       few others. (Emelyanov gave me the list in order of appearance but I cannot reproduce it nor
       can I remember whether <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> came in with this
       group. I think so. Certainly he was there because Emelyanov frequently referred to the fact
       that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was sitting with his head in his
       hands.)</p>
                        <p>Apparently <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> presided but shortly turned the
       meeting over to Suslov. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> (or possibly Suslov or
       both) referred to troubles in the Presidium which they had been unable to resolve over a
       period of many months and about which they had just been meeting for two days. Suslov then
       described the nature of these difficulties. According to Emelyanov this was done in a very
       quiet restrained but systematic and devastating way.</p>
                        <p>The kinds of charges against <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> which
        <persName corresp="#p_SMA1">Suslov</persName> made in his speech (or which Emelyanov
       mentioned) were the kind reported in the N.Y. Times European edition during the last few days
       (i.e. Oct 21, 22, 23), i.e. arbitrary exercise of power, unwillingness to accept advice,
       nepotism, rude and violent reaction to any criticism or suggestion.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, Emelyanov described a row about agriculture that had taken place last
       February where <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had supported Lysenko
       against other scientific agricultural experts in the academy, had told the opposing faction
       they were stupid ignoramuses and had threatened to disband the academy.</p>
                        <p>(Because of such digressions as the above I find it difficult to be sure of the order of
       events he related.) To resume the account of the meeting:</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SMA1">Suslov</persName> gave the conclusion of the Presidium meeting
       that the present one-man rule must end, that there must be new men appointed as Premier and
       as Secretary.</p>
                        <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0187"/>
                        <p>He then said there was agreement that policies should not be changed, that the
       recommendations of the 20th, 21st and 22nd Party Congresses should continue to be carried
       out. At this statement there was general applause including applause by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> himself.</p>
                        <p>Either at this point or earlier <persName corresp="#p_SMA1">Suslov</persName> stated that
       the conclusions of the meetings of Presidium had been unanimous.</p>
                        <p>Shortly after this <persName corresp="#p_SMA1">Suslov</persName> said that the business of
       the meeting was to approve the recommendation of the Presidium, nominate a new Secretary of
       the Party and recommend a new Premier.</p>
                        <p>(Emelyanov made quite a point of distinguishing between the right of the Central Committee
       of the Party to name a party official but only to recommend someone for Premier.)</p>
                        <p>(At this point the account began to sound more and more like an account of an American
       party convention.)</p>
                        <p>When the question of nomination for Secretary came up there were shouts of <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> from
       all over the hall and apparently no other nominations. Emelyanov says the voting was
       unanimous but he was so excited he didn't notice how <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> voted or whether he did. This comment implies vote by a show of hands
       but Emelyanov did not actually say how the vote was taken.</p>
                        <p>When the question of recommending Premier came up, the process was similar, shouts of
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and then a unanimous vote.</p>
                        <p> Emelyanov mentioned two documents (presumably accounts of proceedings in the Presidium
       meeting, the Central Committee, or both) one of which he said had been made public, the other
       he thought should be and probably would be. At least he hoped so. He may have been referring
       to two sessions of the Central Committee but I had the impression he was reporting one
       continuous session.</p>
                        <p>Apparently the reports by Suslov of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s inequities were echoed and reinforced by speeches or
       interjections from the floor voicing grievances from various groups all over the country.
       There was apparently no defense of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in the
       committee although I have the impression he had been given a hearing in the Presidium.</p>
                        <p>One comment that Emelyanov made was that it had become increasingly difficult to know
       whether <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> or Adzhubei was Foreign Minister. He
       also complained about <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> taking not only his
       immediate family but a variety of relatives on trips at government expense.</p>
                        <p>In speaking of relations with China Emelyanov said he did not believe that there would be
       any basic change but that if <persName corresp="#p_SMA1">Suslov</persName> were to go to
       China he would be less violent, much “smoother” than <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> which might lead to an easing of strain. Emelyanov
       clearly feels that the basic split is at present irreconcilable particularly in the light of
       their difficulties along the border.</p>
                        <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0188"/>
                        <p>I received no impression as to what determined the timing of the ouster action.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the subsequent public vilification of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, Emelyanov said he thought it was mostly from individuals giving vent
       to personal spite based on grievances.</p>
                        <p>He said he did not know where <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was,
       probably in his apartment near the university or at his country house.</p>
                        <p> Emelyanov gave me quite a speech about the time having passed when Russia or any other
       country could be ruled by a single czar or king. This was along the same lines as his earlier
       remark to me about the need for them to move toward greater
       “democracy.” Though these appear to be his own views he obviously feels
       the recent action is consistent with them.</p>
                        <p>In a later conversation in a general group he said things have changed since
       Stalin's time, now if you are out of favor you lose your job but not your
       head.</p>
                        <p>We did not discuss the cosmonauts at any point.</p>

                        <p>1333. While too soon to draw firm conclusions, I would venture some tentative propositions
       which seem to emerge from ouster of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
       fortnight ago.</p>
                        <p>I. Internally. As a political system, Soviet Communist Party rule has been weakened and has
       acquired a new kind of institutionalized instability. The principle that Central Committee of
       the Party is the custodian and source of legitimacy, established by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> (in self-defense) in 1957, has now been successfully
       used against him, and thus confirmed. The door is thus open for maneuver, intrigue and
       conspiracy among rivals for power within this 170-odd member body, as well as within the
       Presidium proper.</p>
                        <p>
                            <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0189"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> is presently in best power position as Party
       First Secretary, but has been there too short a time to be in full control of party personnel
       and machinery. He is vain and ambitious and, in due course, may well be tempted to follow
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s example by combining top
       party and government roles. Strongest challenger presently visible within leadership is
       Podgorny, whose toughness and ambition are both evident. Younger aspirants, like Polyansky,
       Kirilenko and Voronov, will probably remain in wings while rivalry of older group is played
       out.</p>
                        <p>Both governmental and party organizations have been disrupted by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s tactics. As he groped for ways to make
       an increasingly complex society work, economic management was first decentralized, then
       partly recentralized and then reorganized. The party was split functionally into agricultural
       and industrial sectors, a reform which, though still not fully implemented, clearly involved
       extensive dislocation and disgruntlement of party personnel and will probably be abandoned by
       the new leadership.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet elite in general—bureaucrats, managers, scientists,
       intelligentsia—was practically unscathed by the changes. Indeed, the reaction of
       its membership ranged from indifference to pleasure. It is this elite which collectively
       keeps Soviet society ponderously rolling forward, and it will presumably continue to do so
       under almost any conceivable conditions.</p>
                        <p>Since the dismissal of Marshal Zhukov, the military seems to have been brought under firmer
       party control and they played no direct role in the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> ouster (other than as individual party figures). However, the
       marshals loom in the background, representing a power potential which must be satisfied and
       contained. In a condition of continuing struggle for party power, they might be called upon
       for support by one or the other aspirant. However, the military establishment is unlikely to
       play an independent political role unless the party situation should deteriorate beyond
       anything now foreseeable.</p>
                        <p>The Communist Party system of rule is farther removed from the people. The extent to which
       they were already conditioned by the de-Stalinization campaign was visible in the widespread
       apathy to recent events, and the ouster and obliteration of the image of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> can only increase popular skepticism, even cynicism,
       toward their Communist rulers. It is paradoxical that such should be the net result of the
       efforts of the first ruler in Russian history who actively sought public favor and
       support.</p>
                        <p>II. In the Communist World. In the Communist world, there is likely to be a truce in the
       Sino-Soviet conflict, but no real reconciliation. The conflict is basically national in
       nature, and in the struggle within the world Communist movement, the Soviet position has been
       weakened by the change. With the disappearance of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, Mao Tse-tung <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0190"/>remains the
       only old-line world-known Communist figure, with no visible Russian rivals of significant
       stature. His works circulate everywhere, at a time when <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s declarations are being withdrawn and discredited in his
       own country. It is not credible that Mao will offer terms for settlement of the conflict
       which the Soviet side could possibly accept.</p>
                        <p>While the main immediate purpose of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s ouster was to check the increasing loss of influence and
       support inside world communism, the new leadership has in fact only avoided a looming crisis
       at the cost of weakening the Soviet position for the continuing struggle. If <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> could not exert authority over the Eastern and
       Western European parties, a <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> or a <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> cannot be expected to deal successfully with the more
       prestigious figures in the Soviet family, such as Gomulka, Kadar, Tito, and even Gheorghi
       Dej. That this is the case seems already confirmed by current European Communist reaction to
       recent events here.</p>
                        <p>III. In the Outside World. I believe the fears of the Afro-Asians that the Soviets might
       shift from supporting “national, democratic” governments to supporting
       local Communist parties are unjustified. Not only has the new leadership reaffirmed its
       policies of a united front against “imperialism, colonialism and
       neo-colonialism”, but the dynamics of Moscow's continuing struggle
       against Chinese orthodoxy requires the Sovs to continue along this line in practice. On the
       other hand, it is clear that one of the major charges against <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was his lavishness with foreign aid and his successors will examine
       much more carefully just what they can expect from their investments in such places as India,
       Egypt, Algeria and Cuba.</p>
                        <p>The immediate implications for us of the changed leadership seem fairly obvious; the
       long-range ones less so. The new regime will be more cautious in its approach to the West in
       the dual sense that it will eschew policies which may result in direct <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet military confrontation and at the same time will be less enthusiastic
       than <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in finding areas of common interest,
       with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in particular. Latter, of course, will be function
       of changed Sov tactics in their dispute with Peiping. In sum, there will be no 1962 Cuba, nor
       will there be any spirit of Camp David.</p>
                        <p>We do not envisage any substantive change in Sov positions on major issues, but style of
       diplomacy will be totally different, at least until collectivity phase runs its course. We
       have seen the last of personal, off-the-cuff remarks on major policy issues. Soviet spokesmen
       will follow carefully prepared briefs, whether in public or in private. Such more orthodox
       diplomacy may, in fact, be an advantage for us in that we should have a clearer understanding
       of Soviet positions, undiluted by Khrushchevian bombast.</p>

                        <p>IV. Far Horizons. If one dares look far into the future, the long-range prospect, after a
       period of temporizing and muddling, would seem to be for the evolution of Soviet society in
       the direction of a national socialist state in loose association with Communist Parties which
       have won power or lost their revolutionary elan, while the ChiComs develop a small but tight
       and expanding organization dedicated to perpetuating Marxist-Leninist-Maoist revolutionary
       orthodoxy.</p>

                        <p>There are many controversial issues in the Soviet Union and it seems clear that the Soviet
       leadership divides in different ways, depending upon the issue concerned. Although most of
       the leadership appears to have been agreed upon the necessity of dropping <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, this does not mean that they will hold together on
       other issues. One of the most important divisions is between what might be called the
       Stalinists on the one hand and the Revisionists or Modernizers on the other. The Stalinists
       do not, of course, advocate a complete return to the methods and policies of Stalin but do
       believe in strict Party control and minimum tampering with the ideology.</p>
                        <p>Although the new regime will doubtless be at pains to conceal the direction of their
       policies as long as possible, the few clues we have would appear to indicate that the
       Stalinists are in the ascendancy. Future developments in Soviet policy will be importantly
       affected by the success or failure of the efforts of the new leadership to resolve, or at
       least diminish, their differences with Communist China.</p>
                        <p>Although the United States and other Western countries can probably not determine the
       outcome between the contending factions in the <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0192"/>Soviet Union, they can, to some extent, at least influence developments. Until the trends
       of Soviet policy become more clear, it would be advisable for us to keep open the option to
       the Soviet Union of continuing the broad lines of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s policies toward the West.</p>
                        <p>One of the most important steps which we could take in this direction would be a serious
       attempt to develop our trade relations with the Soviet Union to which they appear to attach
       an exaggerated importance. It is suggested that we be prepared to move promptly after the
       election in this direction.</p>
                        <p>It would appear to me that undue attention has been focused upon the personalities of
        <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. Although I consider <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> the
       more competent of the two, I do not think that either one is capable of establishing himself
       as the sole leader, and I suspect that even now other members of the Presidium have more
       influence in the formulation of policy.</p>

         <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> that reads: “Ambassador came in to

                        <p>The Soviet Government received with satisfaction the statement of President Johnson in his
       discussion with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            <note n="2" xml:id="d67fn2">See <ref target="#d55">Document 55</ref>.</note> that the desire
       of the Government of the U.S.A. for peace has never been so strong and decisive as at
       present, and that the President hopes upon his reelection for another term for the
       possibility of progress in the reduction of tension, in the field of disarmament, and in the
       reduction of military activity. We likewise do not wish to bury anyone or be buried, and we
       are convinced that the difference of views over whose social system is better should not be
       an obstacle to the development of relations between the Soviet Union and U.S.A. in the
       interests of broadening international cooperation and strengthening peace.</p>
                        <p>The President said in that discussion that the U.S.A. needs to do many more necessary
       things than the production of bombs, and that it is in no way pleasing to him to spend $50
       billion per year solely in order to be prepared to destroy someone. We understand this train
       of thought. It goes against our grain as well to divert enormous resources to military
       purposes, which however we must do since the U.S.A. and its allies continue to expand their
       armaments. We are convinced that many other countries as well, which now strive to follow the
       greater powers, would likewise prefer to cast from their shoulders the burden of military
       expenditures. Must we together acknowledge impotence in the face of the arms race, admit its
       inevitability instead of first restraining and limiting it, and then decisively reversing it?
       The Soviet Government advocates this.</p>
                        <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0194"/>
                        <p>Why not for instance pursue a further reduction of military budgets, and a more substantial
       one than was done by the Governments of our countries in the last budgetary year? This could
       be accomplished without any formal agreement as parallel measures by the governments of our
       countries.</p>
                        <p>To give concrete form to the expression of President Johnson concerning the desirability of
       reducing military activity, in our view the possibility of a further mutual reduction of
       troops in Europe deserves attention.</p>
                        <p>In this connection we would like to inform President Johnson that the Soviet Government has
       already reduced its troops stationed outside Soviet borders in Europe by 15,000 men, i.e., it
       has fulfilled the intention concerning which it informed the President in June of this
        year.<note n="3" xml:id="d67fn3">See <ref target="#d36">Document 36</ref>.</note> In its
       turn, as could be understood from the statements of Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> in his recent conversation with the Soviet Ambassador, the
       Government of the U.S.A. has also undertaken a similar reduction of its troops in Europe. Why
       don't we follow this path further? We believe that in this case also it is not the
       form of agreement which is important but the concrete results, and if it suits the Government
       of the U.S.A. more, then appropriate measures can be undertaken in the form of mutual
       example.</p>
                        <p>In a word far from all possibilities have yet been exploited to move forward the reduction
       of international tension which has been noted since the signing of the Moscow treaty on the
       banning of nuclear tests in three environments. In our belief there are still large
       potentials, for instance, in the field of disarmament, problems of effective security in
       Europe and the peaceful regularization of Germany, as well as in other current international
       questions.</p>
                        <p>We share the opinion of the President on the necessity for a display of greater flexibility
       in the approach to the resolution of problems on our agenda and in reaching agreements on
       questions which arise touching the interests of our countries. It is also very important that
       an agreement reached between us on one or another question be honestly observed by both
       sides. We are sure that the President will agree with this, since departure from this
       principle in our relations would not only deprive our efforts to seek genuine mutual
       understanding of a real basis but could result in situations the consequences of which it
       would be difficult even to foresee now. We speak of this not because any doubts have arisen
       on our part for example concerning the observance by the American side of certain obligations
       concerning non-attack on Cuba, we trust the word of the President and trust the agreement <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0195"/>which was reached between the U.S.A. and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on this score. What is at issue is that the fruits of an
       easing of international tension must be enjoyed by all states—large and small,
       friends of your country and friends of our country, no matter how far removed they may be
       from the U.S.A. or the Soviet Union. The state of affairs in the world at the present time is
       such that any infringement of the sovereign rights and legitimate interests of small
       countries is inadmissible in and of itself, inevitably creates or intensifies centers of
       tension and introduces additional complications in relations among large powers, and
       primarily between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the U.S.A.</p>
                        <p>Speaking about the necessity for manifesting flexibility in policy, the President mentioned
       the so-called problem of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> financing. In Moscow, attention
       was paid to Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s
       statement in a recent conversation with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            <note n="4" xml:id="d67fn4">Presumably a reference to the meeting on October 20, also
        attended by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName>. The text of the

       effect that the U.S. Government is not interested in a confrontation with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on this question. The Soviet Government also would not want
       this.</p>
                        <p>We have already said more than once and emphasize again that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> advocates the strengthening in every way possible of the United Nations in its
       activity aimed at the maintenance of peace and security in conformity with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter. In this we are prepared for the closest cooperation with
       the U.S.A. However, the way out of the “financial crisis of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>” should be sought not by means of violating the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter, i.e., of the arbitrary application to one or another
       state of Article 19, but on the basis of strict observance of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, there are manifestations of U.S. foreign policy which cause an exacerbation
       of the international situation, lead to the creation of centers of tension, including also in
       relations between our states. But at the present time we would like to emphasize not those
       questions on which there are differences of opinion between us, but those areas where there
       are points of convergence between us.</p>
                        <p>On the whole we feel that it is necessary to seek agreements, to achieve concrete decisions
       on unsettled questions, to eliminate everything that hinders mutual understanding, to expand
       the spheres of Soviet-American cooperation, including in the exploration of outer space,
       about which the President has spoken, and we note with satisfaction that the intentions
       expressed on this score by the leaders of both of our governments coincide. We think that a
       useful and practical beginning could be made in this matter by continuing the exchange of
       opinions on questions of interest to both sides between the U.S. Secretary <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0196"/>of State and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> Minister
       of Foreign Affairs during the forthcoming <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly
       Session.</p>
                        <p>We would like to say once again that the Soviet Government values relations of trust with
       President Johnson and considers it mutually useful to maintain and develop them, using all
       the channels which have been established.</p>
                        <p>There have been different periods in the history of Soviet-American relations. There were
       times when our countries conducted mutually profitable trade. In the recent past we were
       allies in the grim war against the forces of fascism. The Soviet people treasure the memory
       of the great American President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who did much to create the
       anti-Hitlerite coalition and under whom the principle of mutual respect and understanding of
       the interests of one another was laid as the basis of relations between our countries. We
       speak about this, knowing how highly President Johnson values the activity of President F.D.
       Roosevelt, and believing, that if both our countries will adhere strictly to this tested
       principle, Soviet-American relations will attain the character of genuine good-neighborliness
       and mutually advantageous cooperation.<note n="5" xml:id="d67fn5">A draft reply to this

                        <p>The following are the highlights of a long conversation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>:</p>
                        <p>I did not myself directly raise the question of Sino-Soviet relations, but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> volunteered the fact that everyone else he had talked
       to had raised this question. He said that the Chinese Communists were now pretending that all
       of their difficulties with the Soviet Union were attributable to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> which he said was, of course, not the case. He said
       that while they did not desire to quarrel with the Chinese, the Soviets would not abandon
       their positions of principle. He said this issue had really been decided by the American
       election. If Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GB1">Goldwater</persName> had been elected, he thought
       his Government would have been obliged to review and reconsider its policies. He indicated
       that one of the most strongly held Soviet policies involved was that of peaceful
       coexistence.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> seemed convinced that the new regime
       would follow a more sensible and consistent policy in dealing with Soviet economic problems.
       He strongly implied that the economic reorganization would be along the lines of the Liberman
        proposals.<note n="2" xml:id="d68fn2">For text of Soviet economist Y.G.
        Liberman's article on the role of profit earning capacity and profits in general
        in the Soviet economy, see <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi>, September 9, 1964.</note> He said
       that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had tried to solve all economic
       problems through organizational changes, but what was needed was to deal with substantive
       matters. He did indicate, however, he thought the bifurcation of the Party had been a great
       mistake and would be changed to the extent that it had been implemented. He said that the
       fact was that it was unworkable and the reform had by no means been fully carried out. He
       thought that the Government would try to do away with the duplication and overlapping that
       existed between Party and State organizations.</p>
                        <p>In discussing our own economy, I suggested that most Soviets did not understand the role of
       the regulatory agencies in our economy and that they would be well advised to make a study of
       this.</p>
                        <p>We discussed trade matters at some length and I explained that our trade relations with the
       Soviet Union were being seriously examined. He inquired whether, in the event that economic
       obstacles were removed, political questions would prevent the development of trade. I replied
       that obviously if the Soviet Union embarked on an aggressive policy along the lines advocated
       by Communist China, there would be little prospect of developing active trading relations. In
       this connection, I referred to the role of Congress and existing legislation. I said,
       however, that I thought we recognized that there would always be political matters on which
       we did not agree and that trade could be developed <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0198"/>despite these differences if the overall attitude of both countries was one of attempting
       to resolve problems and not create new ones.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The long-standing draft bilateral air agreement with the Soviet Union provides an excellent
       vehicle for an initial step forward in our relations with the new Soviet regime. As you
       recall, the agreement was negotiated and initialed in August 1961 but signature was postponed
       because of the general deterioration in our relations with the Soviet Union. It is ready to
       be signed at any time and the Soviets have continuously indicated their desire to complete
       the agreement and initiate passenger service. If signed this winter, the agreement would
       permit the initiation of flights between New York and Moscow early next summer. In view of
       the significance of a final decision on this question you may wish to discuss it with Senator
        <persName corresp="#p_FW1">Fulbright</persName> and confirm our impression that conclusion
       of the air agreement should not jeopardize ratification of the consular convention. If
       Senator Fulbright believes that it would, then presumably we would wish to delay signature
       until after the Senate has acted on the consular convention.</p>
                        <p>For purpose of your discussion with the President tomorrow<note n="2" xml:id="d69fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, together with McGeorge Bundy, met with the
        President for 2–1/2 hours on November 10 at the LBJ Ranch in Texas. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName>
        joined them part way through the meeting. (Johnson Library, President's Daily
        Diary)</note> you may wish to recommend that he authorize you to conclude the air agreement
       subject to Senator <persName corresp="#p_FW1">Fulbright</persName>'s concurrence
       in terms of timing.</p>
                        <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0199"/>
                        <p>The advantages of signing the air agreement would be:</p>
                        <p>1. Signing would be an important psychological step in improved relations between the
       United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>2. At a crucial juncture in Sino-Soviet relations, it would provide the Soviets with
       evidence of the success of their “peaceful coexistence” policy as an
       alternative to the Chinese hard line. Since major multilateral agreements with the Soviets
       seem unlikely, bilateral agreements take on added importance.</p>
                        <p>3. Additional Russian tourists and other visitors should be able to come to America, it
       will be easier for United States travelers to visit the Soviet Union, and a significant
       expansion of professional contacts in the civil aviation field will ensue—all
       these represent important strengthening of our program to increase and improve
       communication.</p>
                        <p>4. There are a number of secondary advantages, such as familiarization with Soviet aviation
       techniques, improved courier service to the Embassy, a modest enhancement of Scandinavian
       bargaining position against the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on aviation
       matters.</p>
                        <p>On March 4 of this year in a memorandum to the President<note n="3" xml:id="d69fn3">Presumably a reference to <ref target="#d22">Document 22</ref>.</note> on this subject you
       recommended that the question of signing the agreement be reassessed once prospects for
        <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> action against Cuba had been exhausted. In addition, in
       discussing the disadvantages it was assumed that the Brazilian Government under President
       Goulart would immediately follow our action by permitting Aeroflot to gain entry in Brazil.
       Both of these disadvantages have been reduced or removed since that time. Remaining
       disadvantages would be:</p>
                        <p>1. Our efforts to restrict air contact with Cuba might be impaired.</p>
                        <p>2. Bloc airlines might exploit the signature to gain access to Latin America, although this
       seems somewhat less likely given the change of government in Brazil.</p>
                        <p>3. Our ability to prevent air agreements by Communist countries which would permit their
       operation to other less developed countries would be reduced. However, this capability is
       already seriously diminished in Africa and the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>Should your talks with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> at the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> proceed favorably, you may wish to consider signing the air
       agreement together with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in New York at that
       time.</p>

                        <p>1465. I saw <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> this afternoon at 2:30
       (appointment postponed at his request) and had conversation with him on broad range of
       subjects lasting hour and a quarter. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> took
       initiative in raising Article 19 issue to which much of conversation devoted and made clear
       that the Soviet Govt's position is unchanged. While I cannot be sure from his
       treatment of subject, I had impression that probably his attitude toward participation in
       bilateral talks, if not his attendance in GA session may be affected by outcome Article 19
       issue. At least, he tried leave that impression.</p>
                        <p>I started conversation by expressing hope Hornig and I would be able conclude
       desalinization agreement before our departure on 19th,<note n="2" xml:id="d70fn2">For text of
        the Agreement of Cooperation in the Field of Desalination, including the Use of Atomic
        Energy, signed at Moscow on November 18, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy:
         Current Documents, 1964</hi>, pp. 663–664. Donald Hornig, Director of the Office of Science
        and Technology, traveled to Moscow to sign the agreement with <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>.</note> pointing out that <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> this
       morning had handed Smirnovsky our tentative revision of original Soviet draft text which I
       stressed had not yet been cleared by all interested agencies US Govt. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> indicated some familiarity with problem and said that
       he hoped <gloss target="#t_MFA1">MFA</gloss> would be in position to give us their reaction
       to revised text beginning of week in time for signature of agreement before our departure. I
       then referred to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s promise of last
       Feb to provide us with leased line and said I hoped be in position report to principals in
       Washington that our needs had been met. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said
       he too hoped problem “with long beard” would be resolved soon and
        <gloss target="#t_MFA1">MFA</gloss> would probably be in position to give us more specific
       info in near future. I then discussed briefly certain details with regard to social
       activities in connection with upcoming business international meeting and then asked him if
       he were in position inform me as to his own plans with regard opening of <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> on Dec 1. I pointed out that as in past the <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> hoped to have opportunity for talks with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on major problems including bilateral issues and noted
       Sov Govt had also expressed such wish.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he had planned to be in New York on Dec 1
       but outlook for <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> opening may affect his plans. Sov Govt had
       great difficulty in understanding why Article 19 problem had been posed in such sharp terms
       immediately after elections. Sovs had welcomed Pres Johnson's <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173" facs="0201"/>expressed desire to continue former policies directed toward
       development of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Sov relations, and they were at loss to
       understand why in immediate post-electoral period <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had
       stirred up so much agitation over “so-called financial crisis in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>” and “so-called Soviet
       arrearages.” Certainly the Soviets intend to direct their policies toward
       continued improvement <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Sov relations, as reflected in
       statements by both <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, but they had impression that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Govt on contrary is pursuing action which can only result in
       increased tensions.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that so far as <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Govt was concerned our position on Article 19 issue was exactly the same now as
       before elections. As he would recall from my conversation with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>,<note n="3" xml:id="d70fn3">See <ref target="#d63">Document
        63</ref>.</note> which I reaffirmed to him, <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Govt did not
       regard issue as cold war question but one which affects very survival of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. We certainly had no desire to exploit any possible arrangement
       the Sovs might be able to work out which would meet their own political requirements as well
       as avoid automatic application of Article 19. In fact as Stevenson had already demonstrated
       to Fedorenko in <gloss target="#t_NY1">NY</gloss>, we would be prepared to cooperate with the
       Sovs in preventing issue from coming to head.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said Sov Govt does not regard <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter as scrap of paper and would do nothing to violate or
       weaken Charter. This is precisely what would happen if Sov Govt should accept <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> position on arrearages. Sovs had never said they would pay
       expenses incurred by other powers or accede to decision imposed by mechanical majority in
        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. In Sov view all questions relating to peacekeeping forces
       are matter for decision by Security Council alone. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> regretted that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had adopted position on
       question which could only be obstacle to development of good <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Sov relations toward which Sovs have indicated readiness to do all in their
       power.</p>
                        <p>I said we too were genuinely interested in improvement mutual relations but not at price of
        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter. We were convinced that if members of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should be permitted to select assessments they prepared to pay
       this would be death of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. I recognized there was very real
       difference between our points of view but I hoped some way could be found to avoid issue
       coming to head.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said it was simply impossible for Sov Govt to
       agree to payment and at same time maintain position of principle. This would be contrary to
       Charter and Sovs not prepared to do anything in violation of Charter. Sovs are deeply
       convinced their position is correct one, beyond reproach.</p>
                        <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174" facs="0202"/>
                        <p>I said I regretted the Sov attitude since I had hoped some way might be found of preventing
       issue from being joined before opening of <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. I then suggested
       we leave this problem and discuss issues of which <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> might wish raise with <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> on
       assumption he would be in New York.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that in Sov view primary question is to
       ascertain how administration and Pres Johnson personally views prospects of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Sov relations. Sov position in this respect had been made clear
       by <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> in his cosmonaut and Nov 6 speeches<note n="4" xml:id="d70fn4">For text of <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s October 19 speech hailing the achievements of three Soviet
        cosmonauts, see Current Digest of the Soviet Press, November 4, 1964, pp. 5–6. For text of
         <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s November 6 speech, see ibid.,
        November 18, 1964, pp. 3–9.</note> as well as by <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> in his recent statements. Sovs intend to pursue “Leninist
       course of peaceful co-existence between states regardless of differing social
       systems” which had been established as Sov foreign policy line at 20th, 21st and
       22nd Party Congresses. This, in <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s
       view, should be first question for discussion with <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> in
        <gloss target="#t_NY1">NY</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>I said I could assure <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that we hoped to
       continue and expand progress which we had begun last year with signature Test Ban Treaty. We
       had noted favorable references in <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s speeches to desirability of progress particularly in
       disarmament area and I was sure <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> would wish discuss with
        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> concrete issues with hope of injecting new
       life into disarmament discussions. Meanwhile there were certain questions which I would like
       to put to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on which I would be expected to
       comment on my return to Wash. First of these related to Cuba. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would recall past refs to Cuban problem and I had recently noted the
       significant remark by Castro to Sulzberger that the Sovs retained veto on use of surface to
       air missiles deployed in Cuba. I thought it would be useful to have <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s comment on this statement by Castro, as
       spokesman for other interested party.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said since he had not read the full text of
       Sulzberger's interview he would prefer not to comment and in any case he felt it
       desirable avoid discussion of questions directly affecting Cuban-Sov bilateral relations.
       Reverting to my request regarding concrete issues which might be considered in talks with
        <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> noted
       a little progress had been made as the result of past exchanges of views in <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> and elsewhere. It is Sov desire to see such basic problems as
       disarmament and European security on road to solution. If radical solutions of problems not
       immediately acceptable then approach through partial measure should be tried.</p>
                        <p>This approach could be implemented in number of ways—either formal agreements or
       through mutual example. Specific subjects (not exhaustive) <pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0203"/>which <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had in mind were: 1) cuts
       in military budgets; 2) reduction in forces stationed abroad (although Sovs of course favor
       complete withdrawal); 3) non-aggression pact (on which no progress had been made despite
       certain promises made by <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> negotiators during test ban talks to take action aimed at bringing matter to
       positive solution); 4) nuclear free zones or Polish variant which encompassed limitations on
       both nuclear and conventional forces; and finally, bilateral relations, especially economic
       relations. Re latter <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> wished make clear Sovs do
       not intend “beg” for improvements in economic field; Sov position is
       based on ideas that development of trade of mutual benefit. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> recalled conversations with <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>,
        <persName corresp="#p_BG1">Ball</persName> and late Pres <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> on problem in which <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> spokesmen had
       indicated interest, made certain promises, but pointed out action on question should be
       deferred until after election. If <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> side now has proposals or
       observations to make, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would be happy to hear
       them.</p>
                        <p>I said that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s catalog was
       illustrative of the broad range of questions which might be discussed at talks in <gloss target="#t_NY1">NY</gloss>. Meanwhile I was glad to note <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s confirmation of Sov acceptance of step by step approach in
       disarmament. Without going into substance, I said I had list of nine Soviet and eight
       American proposals in disarmament field; we would be prepared discuss all and assumed from
       his remarks he would too. Re bilateral issues we would be prepared to discuss trade and
       related questions, and, of course, we hoped to take early action on consular convention
       ratification. I then reverted to questions on which I might be expected to comment in Wash
       and asked <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> for his views on recent Chinese
       nuclear explosion, particularly why there had been no Sov public reaction to event.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said important thing was to recognize fact of
       nuclear explosion by China and draw appropriate conclusions therefrom. If he were asked what
       conclusion <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> should draw from event he would say first of
       these should be renunciation of traditional <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy toward
       China. He recognized that certain aspects of Chinese policy may be unpalatable to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> but this was no basis for unreal non-recognition policy. In Sov
       view China should be admitted to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and should be participant
       in all negotiations on international problems, particularly those related to disarmament,
       nuclear weapons and security. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that such
       advice of course was pertinent before explosion but in his view this conclusion was made more
       obvious by event.</p>
                        <p>I said that there might be logic in <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s advice if we could be sure that China itself were aware of
       need for more rational approach to world problems. I wondered if in course of conversations
       in recent days with Chinese, Sovs had received any reassuring indications of this.</p>
                        <p>
                            <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0204"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said Sovs could not speak for Chinese and no
       one was authorized to do this except China. If <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had certain
       questions with regard to Chinese policy such questions should be put to Chinese directly. I
       said we do this regularly, but with negative results. I had hoped to hear their talks were
       more reassuring.</p>
                        <p>I then said final question on which I would be asked to comment in Wash was who manned Sov
       end of hot line.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was taken aback, hesitated and then said I had
       put very concrete question to him which he was not prepared at moment to answer. He suggested
       we could return to question at later date. Obviously, he said, if a nation has a govt it
       certainly has to have an authorized spokesman.<note n="5" xml:id="d70fn5">On November 19

                        <p>The most striking aspect of the lunch was <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s insistence on drinking several martinis while I had a glass
       of vodka.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> expressed gratification at the
       outcome of the U.S. elections, and I gave him some details on the extraordinary landslide for
       the President in New York State and the repudiation of Goldwaterism. I said now that there
       had been three elections—the U.K., U.S.S.R. and the U.S., the atmosphere might be
       clearer.</p>
                        <pb n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0205"/>
                        <p>He expressed regret that we had not been able to make more progress since the signing of
       the Test Ban Treaty, and contended that the non-aggression pact had been selected by the
       Soviets for a next possible step, as after considerable discussion it was thought to be the
       easiest for Western countries to accept. I explained the difficulties caused by limitations
       placed on it by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s refusal to
       include access to Berlin.</p>
                        <p>In reply to his question as to how to make progress, I suggested that each side analyze
       carefully the other's proposals for arms limitation, and see whether some program
       would not thereby develop.</p>
                        <p>He, himself, had no specific suggestions, although he contended that the new Government
       would wish to find a basis for further understandings.</p>
                        <p>I asked him why <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s idea of
       voluntary retirement hadn't been carried out. He contended the meetings had been
       orderly, with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in the chair, and the votes
       taken in his presence. I commented that the publicity around the change certainly did not
       give it the impression of as orderly a decision as he maintained. Although he threw no new
       light on the reasons for <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
       removal, he appeared to want us to accept the view that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s independent methods were the basic reason.</p>
                        <p>He pointed to the need in the present circumstances of getting Party approval in the
       Presidium. In answer to my direct question, he maintained that the two jobs would be kept
       separate. When I suggested that <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>, as Party
       Secretary, would call the signals for <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>,
        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> dodged by stating <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> as Secretary would preside over the Communist Party
       meetings.</p>
                        <p>He brought up Article 19 and argued for discussion at the end of the General Assembly
       meeting. I reiterated the impossibility of any delay from our standpoint. He argued also
       about the difficulties which this created for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. I
       underlined the need for the Soviets to face the issue, and accept voluntary payment
       compromise.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> came up for its usual argument. At one point, I asked him
       why the Soviets didn't propose <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> for China. He
       replied that China was now a nuclear power, which I scoffed at. In spite of my pressing, he
       threw no new light on Sino-Soviet relations, although he tried to get me to believe that
       their unity was based on both countries being communist.</p>
                        <p>He kept coming back to further progress in settlements of outstanding issues, so I asked
       him how soon the Soviet Union would get tired of its vast expenditures in Cuba, and
       reiterated that we would never accept a Cuba as a base for communist subversion. He dodged
       this one.</p>

                        <p>The conversation throughout was genial and at times jocular. I had to break it up early as

                        <p rend="center">MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION WITH SOVIET AMBASSADOR ANATOLIY DOBRYNIN </p>
                        <p>Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and I had dinner last evening (November 18)
       with Ambassador and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. Following dinner
       the Ambassador and I had a rather long and wide ranging talk while the two ladies went off to
       look at movies.</p>
                        <p>I called Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s attention
       to news stories indicating that, as we now see it, the prospect is that our defense budget,
       to be presented to the Congress, would show a continuation of a slightly downward trend and
       that the total would be just under $50 billion. In addition to the slightly more than billion
       dollar decrease in the over-all total, I said that he should take into account that this also
       represented an absorption of a substantial military pay increase of approximately a billion
       dollars. I reminded him that in commenting on this public information I wished to underline
       that we were not talking about any agreement or understanding or any loss of freedom of
       action but that if the information I had discussed was relevant to decisions being made in
       Moscow he could call it to their attention. I added the comment that we were still interested
       in some technical talks about the comparability of our two defense budgets. I told him that
       we were not at all clear about the meaning of the defense cuts announced by the Soviet Union
       last year because we were under the impression that their research and development budget had
       been significantly increased. He said he was not aware of the latter point but would check
       into it.</p>
                        <p>We then had a long and inconclusive discussion of Article 19. I pointed out to him, in
       connection with the Soviet charge that we were <pb n="179" xml:id="pg_179" facs="0207"/>whipping this up into a great issue, that Moscow had apparently overlooked the fact that we
       had made no special campaign of the matter on the basis of failure of the Soviet Union to pay
       these assessments during the past two years. Were their arrearage moved beyond the two year
       level a constitutional issue under the Charter was raised and this issue very much affected
       our own interests and our own constitutional arrangements here at home for obtaining the
       necessary support for the United Nations. I said that we were surprised and disappointed that
       the Soviet Union presented us with this problem through a failure to keep their arrearages
       within the two year limit. He repeated the well worn Soviet position. We agreed that it would
       be better for the discussions to continue in New York with the informal committees working on
       the problem, with the Secretary General and between our delegations. He seemed to press
       rather hard for the idea that the issue ought to be deferred until the end of the General
       Assembly to give more time to work out an agreement on the “present and future
       aspects of the problem.” When I questioned him about the
       “present” aspects of the problem, he backed away fast and indicated
       that he saw no chance for a change in the Soviet position on that portion. I told him I
       thought it would be very difficult to postpone the Article 19 problem if the General Assembly
       expected to go ahead with its business, including voting procedures.</p>
                        <p>He left me the definite impression that he expected <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in New York about the 29th of November.</p>
                        <p>We talked somewhat about non-proliferation and I told him that it was my information that
       both Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> had commented to foreign visitors in recent weeks that
       the Soviet Union had provided the Chinese with information and materials suitable for a
       nuclear explosion and that the Soviets had been somewhat surprised that the explosion had not
       occurred much earlier. I told him that this had not coincided with earlier information which
       the Soviets had given to us about having limited their cooperation to the peaceful uses
       field. He said he was not aware of the point I raised but that he would “check
       into it.”</p>
                        <p>We then discussed Cuba along standard lines. The only thing of any particular interest was
       that, in connection with my strong emphasis upon Castro's interference in other
       countries in the hemisphere, he seemed to be trying to say that this had been stopped in
       recent months. I called his attention to the special importance of the most recent meeting of
       the Foreign Ministers of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> and pointed out that the
       Foreign Ministers exchanged information among themselves about Castro's activities
       in the hemisphere which went considerably beyond the particular Venezuelan case and that the
       Foreign Ministers had taken all of the “peaceful” measures that were
       available to them under the Rio Treaty. I emphasized that we hoped that Castro got the clear
       message <pb n="180" xml:id="pg_180" facs="0208"/>that such activities must stop. In
       connection with the Soviet military personnel in Cuba I told <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that we were aware that there has been a considerable reduction of
       their military personnel but that those who remain are too many. He said that they were there
       to train Cubans in the use of large quantities of Soviet military equipment which the Cubans
       did not know how to use.</p>
                        <p>In connection with talks with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in New
       York I suggested that it might be useful for us to “box the compass” to
       see where there might be any points in which we could make some headway. I described our
       attitude as like “an infantry advancing on a broad front.” Where we
       could move forward we were prepared to do so but if we encountered difficult problems or
       obstacles it might be necessary to take more time.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the conversation <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> tried to leave
       the impression that Moscow was expecting some real fresh starts from the Johnson
       Administration following the election and that they hoped that this would affect more things
       than possibly some increase in trade.</p>

                        <p>Dear Nick:</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> has reviewed with me the course
       of the proceedings in the Ivanov espionage trial, and has reported on his talks with you in
       May 1964 and again last week. As the trial of Ivanov comes to a close, I believe we should
       consider carefully what disposition of the non-American defendant would best serve the
       national interest. As you know, the Soviet Government pressed strongly for the release of
       Ivanov following his arrest and indictment last spring. We made it clear to the Soviets that
       release could not be considered at that time, and that Ivanov would have to stand trial.</p>
                        <pb n="181" xml:id="pg_181" facs="0209"/>
                        <p>In the event of conviction, the question arises whether he should serve whatever sentence
       may be imposed by the trial judge, or whether he should be permanently expelled from the
       United States following imposition of sentence. I believe it would be in the over-all
       interest of the United States that Ivanov's sentence be suspended and that he be
       permanently expelled from this country.</p>
                        <p>We have, from time to time, cases of Americans who are arrested and held in the U.S.S.R.
       and other Soviet Bloc countries on a variety of grounds. It is a continuing concern of the
       United States Government, and indeed a statutory responsibility of the Executive Branch under
       22 U.S.C. 1732, to afford all reasonable protection and assistance to American citizens
       imprisoned abroad. While, of course, we would not want to adopt a policy of deportation for
       Bloc nationals in all cases, I believe that in present circumstances action to deport Ivanov
       following a criminal conviction would be helpful to our efforts at safeguarding the rights of
       Americans and securing their release when detained.</p>
                        <p>As you know, the relations of the United States with the U.S.S.R. extend over a very wide
       range of questions. Taking into account the whole spectrum of those relations at this time,
       and considering the Ivanov case in their context, I believe it would best serve United States
       interests to expel Ivanov after conviction and sentence rather than require him to serve a
       prison sentence in this country.</p>
                        <p>I write now to ask your concurrence in such a course of action, so that arrangements may be
       made for an appropriate recommendation to the trial judge by the United States Attorney
       following completion of the trial. I would hope that the case might be terminated and Ivanov
       deported very promptly, without any substantial lapse of time between conviction and
       sentencing.</p>
                        <p>If you would be prepared to proceed as suggested above, I should like officers of the
       Department of State to work out with officials of your Department the further steps which
       might appropriately be taken.<note n="2" xml:id="d73fn2">On December 1 <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> replied saying that the release of Ivanov, a career
        officer in the KGB, for an American tourist, Peter Landerman, would be a bad bargain, and he
        could not concur in the suggestion made in <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s letter. (Ibid.) On December 8 <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> raised the issue again saying that the reason for expelling Ivanov was not
        to gain the release of Landerman but to help in protecting and assisting all American

       discussed, and provide further indications of shape of Sov foreign relations in coming
       period.</p>
                        <p>1. Internally, this week's organizational and personnel changes reflect
       leaderships preoccupation with need to establish control of party and administrative
       apparatus. In general, they seem not only to be reworking party structure, but continuing
       search for economic reforms and improvement of methods of industrial management.</p>
                        <p>2. Chou visit and related statements (Embtel 1546)<note n="3" xml:id="d74fn3">Dated
        November 17. (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66,
        CSM 1–1 CHICOM–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>)</note> have reinforced indications
       that basic differences between <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> will continue and that Soviets will be faced with need to try
       to avoid complete fragmentation of world movement, while trying to forestall airing of
       dispute which would help bring this about.</p>
                        <p>3. Responses of <gloss target="#t_EE1">EE</gloss> leaders and of such major free world CPs
       as Italian and French to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
       removal, while varied, have given current Sov leadership little reason for confidence that
        <gloss target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss>'s leading role in movement is enhanced or
       even undamaged by last month's events. Soviets may well be able to improve
       relations with some friendly bloc parties, utilizing argument that they have amended tactics
       in Sino-Soviet dispute along lines recommended by Poles, Rumanians, Italians in order
       establish modus vivendi without sacrifice of principle. However, with bargaining position
       weakened, Sovs likely to be unable to restore fully their central role and will continue to
       face pressures for greater autonomy.</p>
                        <p>4. To extent that Soviet policy toward free world has been thought out and restated in past
       month, it consists of cautious repetition of main lines with increased emphasis on peaceful
       coexistence and improved relations with West. This appears most clearly in latest <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> speech (Nov 6) and Pravda leader (Nov 13). Latter
       while essentially exegesis on former, increasingly highlighted positive aspects of E–W and
       underplayed anti-imperialism, military vigilance, etc. (Note that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s remarks at signing desalting agreement (Embtel 1557)<note n="4" xml:id="d74fn4">Dated November 18. (Ibid., E 11–3 <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>)</note> were unusually positive.)</p>
                        <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0211"/>
                        <p>It would be erroneous to infer shift in Sov outlook toward West, nor is there any reason to
       believe <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s departure from scene
       would cause such shift. With no change in goals or even in major policies Sovs have, however,
       signalled shift in tone and probable tactics. If nothing else, combination of private and
       public expression reflects desire for period of calm in E–W relations.</p>
                        <p>Reasons for this would seem to lie along two lines. First, with strong reiteration of
       peaceful coexistence line in confrontation with Chinese, not only are Soviets turning down
       alternative, vigilant, hardened line which Chinese would wish, but Moscow puts itself under
       pressure to demonstrate some success for its approach. Second, and probably more basic reason
       lies in totality of pressures in domestic and intra-Communist areas which enforce need for
       period of relative quiet in relations with non-Communist world.</p>
                        <p>If this so, we can expect period of some passivity in E–W relations coupled with interest
       in indications of détente, particularly in areas such as expansion of trade and
       exchanges, but lacking in serious initiatives leading either to improvement or to
       tensions.</p>
                        <p>On other hand, however, leadership can be expected to be more defensive and to show concern
       to avoid actions reflecting its weakness. This would include both sharp reactions to moves
       which seem to challenge Sovs and verbal restatement of firm position on contentious issues
       where this brought into question. This pattern of action likely to become most apparent on
       such major problems as Article 19, Berlin, <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Forthcoming period may be one in which—even more than in past—Soviet
       actions in E–W relations will often seem contradictory or inconsistent. Most important,
       however, it promises to be period in which, while tactical shifts may occur, continuation of
       main lines of policy which current leadership has inherited will not be altered.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary thanked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> for the good
       reception given to the U.S. businessmen who recently visited Moscow.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> commented that he had detected among
       U.S. businessmen considerable interest in expanding U.S.-Soviet trade and that it was now up
       to the State Department to adopt a more forthcoming attitude.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed that there was indeed some interest in furthering trade between the
       two countries. Senator <persName corresp="#p_FW1">Fulbright</persName> was to have hearings
       in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee aimed at this objective. While any significant
       expansion would require changes in the present legislation, there were certain things which
       could be done within the existing law. However, he wished to note the practical problem of
       what the two countries could be interested in buying and selling. As he pointed out to Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> at Mr. Nehru's funeral in New
        Delhi,<note n="2" xml:id="d75fn2">See <ref target="#d33">Document 33</ref>.</note>
                            <pb n="185" xml:id="pg_185" facs="0213"/>the economies of our two countries are in many ways
       similar, so that it might be difficult to find commodities in which they could usefully
       trade. He remarked in a light vein that vodka and caviar were the obvious commodities we
       would be interested in buying from the Soviet Union, but one could not go very far only on
       that basis. In this connection, he thought it might be useful to have a strictly technical
       discussion of the commodities in which the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. could trade, putting aside
       for the moment the political aspects of the problem, such as lend-lease and the <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> question. Such a review should be conducted very quietly,
       perhaps at the Economic Counselor level and without any special delegations. Of course, the
       Soviet Economic Counselor in Washington could be supported by an expert sent from Moscow for
       this purpose. The Secretary thought that this study could be very useful in Congress, and
       particularly to Senator <persName corresp="#p_FW1">Fulbright</persName> in his hearings,
       since one of the first questions which was likely to arise would concern items the U.S. and
       U.S.S.R. could trade in.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> expressed interest in the Secretary's idea
       and observed that as far as U.S. businessmen were concerned, they seemed to be interested in
       a number of Soviet commodities. For example, U.S. businessmen seemed to regard Soviet
       equipment for hydro-electrical plants to be superior to that produced in the U.S. and might
       be interested in buying it. The same applied to Soviet equipment for transmission of
       electrical power, as well as the Soviet-developed continuous casting process.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary wondered whether the Soviet Union was now interested in selling technology as
       distinct from equipment to which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied
       in the affirmative and noted that the Soviet Union had sold licenses to a number of
       countries.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then pointed out that there was another problem which should be kept in mind.
       While the Soviet Union, with its centralized system, could undertake specific commitments to
       perform under a trade arrangement, the U.S. was in a different position. With our free
       enterprise system, the U.S. Government could not direct private companies to sell to, or buy
       from, the Soviet Union. We would be interested in the experience the Soviet Union has had in
       this respect in its dealings with other Western countries.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked whether the U.S. would be willing
       to consider a trade agreement, noting that Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BG1">Ball</persName> had mentioned such a possibility on one occasion some time ago. The
       Secretary did not exclude such a possibility, but stressed that there were a number of
       political and technical problems involved in this matter, including those he had
       mentioned.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> referred to discussion of military budgets at

        75</ref>.</note> and his understanding U.S. military budget FY 66 would be further reduced.
       He stated that “taking into account” U.S. reduction <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was prepared to reduce its own upcoming military budget by
       500 million rubles. Since their budget preceded U.S. they would probably make their
       announcement first. <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> said he did not carry all military
       budget figures in head and would not wish mislead <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. Referring to questions raised by <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> during previous conversation <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> said
       he would ascertain exact figures planned as rapidly as possible and inform Soviet side more
       specifically. During ensuing discussion complexities military budget, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asserted military figures in Soviet budget included
       military research and development and denied separate research and development figures were
       in fact military.</p>

       he himself believed actual cooperation in specific projects would be desirable: for example
       if we could have together launched Mars shot. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
       confirmed government interested in developing further cooperation in this field but suggested
       consideration would be easier if U.S. could put up concrete suggestions. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> mentioned subject had been discussed during recent visit
       President's Science Advisor, Hornig, to Moscow and suggested some specific ideas
       might emerge from this.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> thanked <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
       for Soviet Govt decision to approve leased line for Embassy communications which led to some
       jocular remarks about long beard having finally been shaved off this question. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> commented no force in Soviet Union strong enough to
       resist U.S. Ambassador's insistence.</p>
                        <p>Soviet aide raised question of premises for Soviet Embassy building in Wash. <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> assured them <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> was doing
       everything possible to move this forward and expressed hope favorable sites might be
       forthcoming near future. <persName corresp="#p_FNT1">Fedorenko</persName> then registered
       complaint about tax problem on Soviet property (“my residence”) at Glen
       Cove. Yost assured him <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> doing utmost resolve problem but
        <persName corresp="#p_FNT1">Fedorenko</persName> suggested that housing problems should be
       reciprocal. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> commented on latter <persName corresp="#p_FNT1">Fedorenko</persName> was going too far and U.S. Amb in Moscow would remain
       where he is.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> raised question of moving forward to comprehensive test
       ban and asked whether responsible colleagues should get together on subject. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> responded “at any time” and it
       was agreed Tsarapkin and Foster should meet in <gloss target="#t_NY1">NY</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> emphasized U.S. does not and will not take part in any French
       testing program and asked if <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> could say same
       with respect to Peking? <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied Soviets have
       nothing to do with China program; “we have no relations” in this field.
       Question of Chinese participation in test ban is hypothetical one which should not interfere
       with Soviet-American cooperation this field. Positive advantages would outweigh other
       considerations. However, to prevent misunderstanding <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> wished to say verification should be by national means. Kohler commented
       U.S. had been experimenting in improving seismological methods and he had invited Soviet
       participation in experiments. Invitation had been proffered and he hoped <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would still agree. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> nodded affirmatively but no commitment was made. In this connection
        <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> remarked Soviet side had sometimes refused invitations
       for example to visit Cape Kennedy. He hoped this was not out of fear that U.S. would claim
       reciprocity since if we issued specific invitation we had no such intention.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> raised question of reduction of foreign troops
       in Europe. This discussion inconclusive except both sides agreed there had already been some
       reduction.</p>
                        <p>Stressing that he was engaging in personal exploration, <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> expressed hope time approaching when we might find bold, broad concept for
       settlement of situation in Central Europe. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
       responded that pending bold and total solution we should not exclude partial solutions as we
       had done in case of reduction of military budgets and Limited Test Ban Treaty. However
       Soviets were also prepared for bold approach to solutions of problems including Germany.
       Still speaking personally <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> asked whether there might be
       any point in quiet undramatic <pb n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0216"/>four-power
       conversations, citing as encouraging in this connection recent pass arrangements in Berlin
       and in respect of trade. U.S. could not move very far without agreement its allies so
       problems of procedure as well as substance arose. As illustrative example said four-powers
       might suggest that Germans get together to consider humanitarian measures. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> responded if reunification of Germany were to be
       considered <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would say at once this is matter for two
       German states to discuss. Procedure should be subordinated to substance. He did not know what
       other countries involved would do. U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had come
       closer together on certain respects as regards German problem in 1961–1962 discussions.
       Perhaps we should start again from where we then left off. <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> replied obviously he was not speaking for France but “we
       can't go very far without others.” Suggested specific small steps might
       include movement of people exchanges, reunion of families. In reply to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s query as to whether U.S. really prepared
       make forward progress on German question, <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> agreed we had
       made some progress in previous bilateral talks but could not move on certain irreducible
       points. He expressed interest in knowing whether <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> thought there were perhaps more important points where progress would be
       possible, commenting that he would be talking with his allies in Paris in the near
       future.</p>
                        <p>In absence of further response from <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> asked if he were planning to make new proposals on
       disarmament in his <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> speech. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied nothing drastic planned; Soviet proposals already made were good
       but of course could be improved.</p>
                        <p>Following luncheon <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> reverted to subject of Germany.
       For twenty years this has been most difficult problem involving confrontation two powers and
       imposing on both great arms burden when they have unfinished business at home. It would be
       good to have real solution to German question perhaps with security features attached.
       However he saw no possibility except on basis self-determination for people involved.
       Seventeen million Germans should not have decisive influence on relations of nearly one
       billion population <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and Warsaw Pact powers. If East
       Germans should freely choose remain as they are in separate state U.S. would accept. If East
       Germans selected to go other way, then even from Soviet point of view it seemed to him other
       desirable possibilities would open up and this major question could be removed from our
       agenda. Perhaps it was not yet time for such bold approach and still necessary deal with
       smaller questions. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied either radical
       solution of German problem or partial steps were possible. The question was what does radical
       solution mean? U.S. view contemplated reunification under term
       “self-determination” as used by West. This was becoming less and less
       possible as two states developed and <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> pursued hostile line
       toward <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. In Soviet view two German states existed with <pb n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0217"/>deep watershed between them, especially as regards
       social systems. <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and Western attitude toward <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> makes watershed deeper. <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
       pursuing line remilitarization and acquisition nuclear weapons which made prospects
       reunification or even rapprochement increasingly difficult. Reunification could only be
       considered on basis decision both German states. If we were realistic radical solution would
       be by German peace settlement and solution related questions which we had discussed
       previously and on which our views at end came closer together. Though it was true we had
       found no common language on some problems and some knots remain, especially relating to
       presence Western forces in West Berlin and access thereto, Soviets believe that formalization
       two German states would contribute toward eventual reunification. However this of course
       would depend on will of both states and settlement problems involved such as sovereignty,
       frontiers, renunciation of nuclear arms. He did not mean by this to say that humanitarian
       questions mentioned by <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> were not of proper significance.
       If he were asked how to move forward he would say we should explore and seek agreement
       starting from point where previous exchange of views ended. As to role of other powers
       specific questions arose, for example France did not want to discuss disarmament. Question
       was whether things would develop in peaceful fashion or militaristic discussion as in <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> question related but has
       independent significance of its own. <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> plans prejudiced
       talks on disarmament, complicate European situation and Soviet-American relations. However we
       could talk separately on that subject. Soviets had noted with satisfaction U.S. declaration
       U.S. would not allow Germany to lead it into ventures in Europe. Serious aspect was FRG
       access to nuclear weapons. <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> agreed further meeting
       needed to discuss these questions in detail while <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in New York. However before turning to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
       problem he wished clear up one serious misunderstanding. U.S. had no intention facilitate
       proliferation nuclear weapons; quite the contrary as our acts have shown for example with
       respect to France. Problem had become acute during past ten years because of Soviet
       development of nuclear weapons and targeting of hundreds of such weapons on Western Europe.
       Those about to be incinerated had a legitimate interest in having right to be consulted as
       respects nuclear weapons.<note n="6" xml:id="d76fn6">At their third meeting on December 5

        Leaders</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>With the advent of a new regime in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the
       completion of our own elections, it would appear particularly timely to seek methods of
       increasing the political impact of our efforts through the exchange program with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. It is too early to be certain that the new Soviet leaders
       will, as they claim, continue on their present course. However, on the basis of their
       statements, the outlook for more significant exchanges now seems somewhat improved.</p>
                        <p>While we can look with satisfaction at the number of Soviet technicians, cultural figures
       and agricultural specialists who have visited the United States, a striking gap in our
       efforts to open up the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> exists in the lack of visits by
       Soviet political, economic and military leaders to this country. We consider it is highly
       desirable to move now to fill this gap. We would hope to thus achieve a better appreciation
       by Soviet political, economic, and military leaders of United States strength and provide
       them with a firsthand comprehension of the dimensions of the problem which they face in the
       pursuit of a basically hostile policy toward us. At the same time we would seek to portray to
       them the benefits of genuine peaceful coexistence and even cooperation.</p>
                        <p>In the post-election period we assume that domestic American receptivity to the types of
       visits we are proposing is enhanced not only by the completion of the election, but also by a
       record of several months in which the Soviets have behaved with relative restraint.</p>
                        <p>In general terms we recommend preparing a program specifically designed to bring to the
       United States as many members of the Central Committee as possible, and a cross section of
       top level and second echelon Soviet military and economic officials. It would, of course, be
       necessary to bring Central Committee members in some capacity other than their Communist
       Party position. Since most of them have dual roles this may be accomplished under programs
       such as those listed <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0219"/>below as well as others which
       would be suggested from an examination of the CC membership in detail. While the exchanges
       program is the most obvious vehicle for such an endeavor, a number of extra-agreement
       programs might be considered and some traditional taboos within the exchanges program might
       be reconsidered. The following examples are illustrative of what we have in mind:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Political Exchanges</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Parliamentary Exchange</hi>. We have long resisted any exchange
       between Congress and the Supreme Soviet on the basis that the two bodies are not equivalent.
       It has been assumed that Congress would object strenuously to any such exchange. However, we
       have had several indications in recent years that many Congressmen, if not most, would not
       oppose such exchanges. The Soviets of course have assiduously sought to establish exchanges
       of this sort. If a review of the question with selected Congressional leaders shows general
       support for such an exchange, it would provide broad opportunities to bring a large number of
       present and potential Soviet leaders to the United States. In such an effort the
       Inter-Parliamentary Union might prove useful.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Trade Union Exchanges</hi>. This also is a category which we have
       avoided because of reluctance to accept the Soviet trade unions as a genuine labor movement
       and the possible complication of our efforts to promote the <gloss target="#t_ICFTU1">ICFTU</gloss>. Our position has also been in deference to the hostility of most American
       trade union leaders to the Soviet trade union movement. The Soviets have persistently
       attempted to develop exchanges in this field. It would seem to be worthwhile to discuss this
       question with American trade union leaders and urge them to reconsider their opposition to
       controlled exchanges on the grounds that it would expose important Soviet leaders to the
       power of United States and our democratic trade unions. It has been amply demonstrated that
       American union officials are well equipped to out-argue Soviet visitors and present the
       United States point of view with impressive conviction. Dealing with individual Soviet
       unioners certainly need not amount to endorsement of the <gloss target="#t_WFTU1">WFTU</gloss> at the expense of the <gloss target="#t_ICFTU1">ICFTU</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Information Leaders</hi>. While a number of prominent Soviet
       journalists including Adzhubei have visited the United States, we have so far only skimmed
       the barrel in this field. We would recommend that, with the cooperation of <gloss target="#t_RSB1">RSB</gloss>, we single out present and potential Soviet leaders in the
       field and through devices such as regional and city publishers and editors exchanges, get as
       many of them as possible to the United States.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Local and Provincial Government Leaders</hi>. A careful analysis of
       the paths to top-level political authority in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would
       probably indicate that tomorrow's Presidium members are today's
       provincial leaders. Because of the barrier posed by the Communist apparat as opposed <pb n="192" xml:id="pg_192" facs="0220"/>to the governmental track of authority, it may often be
       difficult to define the actual seat of power in such a way that we can get at such people and
       arrange their participation in exchanges trips. However, one promising vehicle would be to
       exploit mayor to mayor, governor to governor, pairings. This type of exchange has often been
       approached with legitimate tenderness because of presumed domestic political back-lash. It
       would seem that careful selection and proper persuasive briefing could reduce this to a
       marginal problem, and permit us to exploit Soviet interest in such contacts.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Review Present Programs</hi>. A few Central Committee members have
       already visited the United States under functional programs. An analysis of the Central
       Committee membership would in many instances provide functional and professional interests of
       the members. This in turn would enable us to attempt to get them to the United States under
       professional or technical exchange auspices.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Economic Leader Exchanges</hi>. A reverse Business International
       Conference is only one of many possible techniques for attracting top-level Soviet economic
       figures.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Military Visits</p>
                        <p>Plans have already been made for a Soviet military delegation to visit the United States
       early next year in exchange for our latest National War College trip to the Soviet Union. We
       also “owe” Marshal Vershinin a visit in exchange for General
       Twining's 1956 trip to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Beyond that, we
       consider that a number of possibilities exist to bring significant numbers of Soviet officers
       to the United States under a program deliberately designed to exploit exchanges and other
       devices to achieve this end. Such things as Civil War centennials, military athletic
       contests, space launchings, and military academy functions could be considered. Finally the
       oft proposed Red Army Chorus visit might also prove appropriate (in exchange for an
       appropriate American feature) within this context.</p>
                        <p>In all these programs two important restraining factors obviously have to be kept in mind.
       First, if handled with too much publicity or in too grand a fashion, suspicion would
       inevitably develop. Thus the broad outlines of the program would perhaps better remain
       veiled. Timing would also be a critical factor. Too much at once-too many visits within too
       short a time, obviously would increase the possibility of the programs being misunderstood.
       As a general rule of thumb it would seem desirable to avoid drawing attention to the fact
       that a program as such is involved. Secondly, it would be essential to clear individual
       aspects, if not the overall design, with our interested allies. This is particularly true of
       military projects. Since discussion of a project in general terms would raise the possibility
       of publicity through leaks and the very domestic hostility which we seek to avoid, allied
       interests <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0221"/>would probably be best handled on a case
       by case basis. A purely bilateral coloration should be avoided as far as possible to reduce
       the possibility of misinterpretation. However, even though a certain amount of criticism
       would inevitably develop, we are convinced that the potential gains to primary United States
       objectives are clearly overriding.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation:</p>
                        <p>If you agree, <gloss target="#t_SOV1">SOV</gloss> together with <gloss target="#t_SES1">SES</gloss> will undertake discussion of these objectives with appropriate <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CU1">CU</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> offices.

        of regulatory agencies in the United States and the placing of a Russian-speaking American
        in a Soviet factory would be valuable. (Ibid.)</note>

                        <p>The President opened by expressing his pleasure at seeing Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in Washington. He said that the Secretary had reported to him on his
       conversations with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>;<note n="2" xml:id="d78fn2">At a luncheon at the Soviet Embassy at 1 p.m. on December 9, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
        discussed the Soviet Embassy building in Washington, the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, disarmament, Germany, Southeast Asia, U.S.-Soviet trade, and Article 19 of the
         <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter. Memoranda of these conversations are in National
        Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Secretary's Memoranda of
        Conversation: Lot 65 D 330. For the memorandum on Southeast Asia, see <ref target="frus1964-68v01#d443">

        memorandum on Germany is ibid., vol. XV, <ref target="#d74">Document 74</ref>.</note> he was
       glad they had taken place and knew they were helpful. The President also said he was pleased
       to have occasional discussions with the Soviet Ambassador, whom we liked very much.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he first wished to thank the
       President for giving up some of his time for the purpose of this meeting. He also wished to
       convey to the President greetings and best wishes from <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>, who had asked him to do so in case he had occasion to
       meet with the President. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he would
       like to touch upon certain questions which the Soviet Government believed to be important
       from the standpoint of U.S.-Soviet relations. He would not go into any details, but would
       deal with them only in general terms. If it was agreeable to the President, he would raise
       those questions one by one, hoping that the President would comment on each of them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the first and the main
       question which was of interest to the Soviet Union was that of the prospects for U.S.-Soviet
       relations. The policy of the Soviet Union had been and continued to be a policy of peace, of
       developing friendly relations with all states, and of peaceful coexistence with all states
       regardless of their social structure. The Soviet Union was ready and wished to develop
       U.S.-Soviet relations. The Soviet Union was prepared to seek agreement on outstanding
       questions, both those directly related to U.S.-Soviet relations and broader international
       problems as well. The U.S.S.R. and the U.S. were poles apart from the standpoint of their
       social structures, but the Soviet Government believed this should be no obstacle to the
       solution of outstanding questions, both those directly related to the U.S.-Soviet relations
       and other international problems. Briefly, this was the general course of Soviet policy,
       including the Soviet Union's policy towards the U.S. He would appreciate it if the
       President would state his views on the prospects for development of U.S.-Soviet relations and
       on the possibilities for agreement on outstanding questions. In the view of the Soviet
       Government, this was a question of primordial importance; it was the question of
       questions.</p>
                        <p>The President observed that he had been President about a year. As he looked back over that
       year, he was pleased at the absence of any <pb n="195" xml:id="pg_195" facs="0223"/>serious
       disagreements or differences between our two countries in their day-to-day work. Of course,
       our two countries had differences of opinion and we approached matters from a different
       standpoint. However, he believed there had been a feeling of interest, respect, and concern
       for our position, and we had also attempted to reciprocate. The President recalled his
       meeting with <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> shortly after he had assumed the
            Presidency,<note n="3" xml:id="d78fn3">See ibid., 1961–1963, vol. V, <ref target="frus1961-63v05#d381">Document 381</ref>.</note> and also said he had enjoyed the various meetings and
       conversations, both official and social, with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. After the change of leadership in the Soviet Union, he was glad to
       learn, through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>, that there had been
       no change in Soviet policy and that the Soviet Union would pursue a policy aimed at
       maintaining peace in the world. He was glad to have received that expression from the new
       leaders. As he had told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> and as he had
       reiterated to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, the primary
       objective of this Administration was to live peacefully with the rest of the world. This was
       not the attitude just of the present Government, but also of the American people at large. In
       the November elections, the American people had clearly indicated that they wanted their
       government to pursue a policy aimed at maintaining peaceful relations with all. The American
       people had rejected a leadership that would have substituted power and force for reason and
       patience.</p>
                        <p>The President continued that in the period of the Democratic administrations, we had been
       encouraged by the progress made in some fields. Agreement had been reached on the hot line,
       on the Limited Test Ban, and the Consular Convention now pending before the Senate. Also,
       there had been reciprocal actions by the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. in cutting back the production
       of fissionable materials for weapons purposes, and substantial reductions had been made in
       our preparedness effort. We had observed with pleasure the desire of the Soviet Government to
       reduce its military budget. As far as we were concerned, in the brief period between 1964 and
       1966, there would be a reduction in our military spending by some $2–3 billion; this was a
       substantial reduction, particularly if one took into account the military pay-raise, which
       obviously would not add to our military effort but would only make it easier for military
       personnel to acquire goods for their own use, such as housing, etc. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s plan provided for the closing of 566
       military installations; just recently, he had announced the closing of 95 such installations.
       This trend towards economy caused hardships in certain areas, but generally speaking the
       American people were pleased with it.</p>
                        <p>The President then noted that he had tried, notwithstanding occasional failure, to
       understand some things he saw in the papers. He <pb n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0224"/>had
       tried to refrain from criticizing Soviet leaders personally, even though sometimes he read in
       the papers about their views on what he did in certain parts of the world. He simply took the
       papers home, showed them to his wife, and tried to forget, without replying. He did so
       because he sincerely believed that both of our countries wanted peace if they could only find
       it. They were like children hunting for Easter eggs, and it was important that both of them
       searched until they were found. Things would be all right if both of our countries showed
       patience and understanding and if they adhered to the principle of “do unto others
       as you would have them do unto you.”</p>
                        <p>Summarizing, the President said we wanted to do everything in order to improve U.S.-Soviet
       relations. He reiterated his pleasure at the hot line agreement, and said he was also pleased
       with the Exchange Program and the understandings reached in the field of outer space. He
       noted that he had received an excellent report from his Science Advisor, Dr. Hornig, who had
       been very well received in the Soviet Union and who had greatly enjoyed his discussions
       there. He had also received a good report from the U.S. businessmen who recently had visited
       the Soviet Union. Reiterating that the Consular Convention was pending in the Senate, the
       President also noted that the U.S.-Soviet Air Agreement was ready for signature; however, we
       didn't want to kill the former by signing the latter prematurely. The President
       reiterated that the November elections clearly showed that the American people rejected the
       course advocated by Goldwater, a course which was opposed to the one the present
       Administration was following. Some people had said rather ugly things about Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> in connection with his economy drive. But we believed
       that the American people at large supported the policies of the present Administration.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> thanked the President for his views and
       said he would convey them to the Soviet Government. He thought there were two main questions
       relating to the U.S.-Soviet relations. The first one was that of the arms race. Arms were
       constantly piling up; indeed, stockpiles were as high as the Mont Blanc. However, what was
       important was not only their quantity but also their destructive capability. The Soviet
       Government believed it would be important if both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., as well as other
       countries, were to find a radical solution to the armaments problem. In such a case, all
       would gain-both the U.S. and U.S.S.R., and also the U.K., France, and others. Of course, this
       was a very complex problem and even if there was a will to resolve it, its solution would
       require time. Therefore, partial steps were needed. He did not wish to enumerate the
       individual steps which the Soviet Union believed would lessen tensions and facilitate
       disarmament, inasmuch as he had discussed them with the Secretary. However, he did want to
       draw the President's attention to one area where <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0225"/>the Soviet Union believed there was possibility of agreement. The Soviet Union
       believed that it should be possible to reduce U.S. and Soviet troops, as well as foreign
       troops generally, in Europe. Such a step would not be important from the standpoint of the
       existing correlation of forces since such correlation would remain unchanged; however, such a
       step would reduce tensions in Europe and in the world at large. Referring to the
       President's remark about the closing of 95 bases, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he wished to point out that one could close 95 obsolete bases and
       build two new ones which would be more powerful than all the 95 taken together. He thought
       this point only emphasized the importance of disarmament.</p>
                        <p>As to the President's remark about some statements aimed at him personally, Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said they were probably an incorrect
       interpretation by the American press. There had been no statements by Soviet leaders aimed at
       personalities; they spoke only in terms of the principles of policy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then said he wished to turn to the European problem,
       and particularly the German question. However, perhaps the President might first wish to
       comment on the arms race problem.</p>
                        <p>The President noted that both sides had had a great number of discussions about disarmament
       and had submitted their respective proposals at various times. He said only today he had
       suggested to the Secretary that the Soviet December 7 statement on disarmament<note n="4" xml:id="d78fn4">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament, 1964</hi>, pp.
        509–517.</note> be fully explored in order to see whether it contained any hope of
       agreement. Earlier this year, the President continued, he had made a statement expounding the
       views of our Government on the subject of disarmament. He hoped progress could be made in
       this area. We were particularly concerned about the problem of non-proliferation. He had
       spent the past two or three days discussing this very problem; namely, how to keep nuclear
       weapons from getting into the hands of others. As to the bases we were closing, they were not
       essential to the state of preparedness we believed was required, and we would save the
       salaries of 50,000–60,000 men who would be released as a result of that action. The President
       reiterated his pleasure at our intended reduction in military spending by $2–3 billion
       between 1964 and 1966, and at the Soviet-announced cut of 500 million rubles in their
       upcoming military budget. He said the U.S. would be willing to consider any suggestions
       regarding disarmament and repeated that we would evaluate the Soviet December 7 disarmament
       statement with a view to fully exploring the possibilities for agreement, if there were
       any.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the remarks made about him personally, he did not mean that there had been
       comments about his height or looks, but he <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0226"/>did wish
       to stress the desirability of not questioning the motives of other governments and of knowing
       what one was talking about. We had always refrained from questioning the motives of the other
       side and we believed this was better for our relations.</p>
                        <p>The President then stressed the concern we had about the nuclear explosion conducted by the
       Chinese Communists. He said we were anxious to avoid a situation where others might follow in
       the footsteps of the Chinese. We were doing all we could to discourage others from embarking
       upon a nuclear weapons program.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that since the President had stated
       the U.S. Government's support for disarmament and non-proliferation, he wished to
       state that it was the Soviet Government's firm position to do everything to
       facilitate disarmament and to prevent proliferation.</p>
                        <p>Turning to Europe, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said World War II had
       left behind it a very complex situation. The Soviet Union did not regret the results of the
       War. Both of our countries had been on the same side of the barricades in World War II, and
       it was as a result of their joint struggle that Nazi Germany had been forced to its knees.
       However, now the situation was different. In the light of past experience, the Soviet Union
       wanted to create a situation in Europe where no seeds of a new world war could be sown. Thus,
       the Soviet Union believed it to be most important for the U.S., the U.S.S.R., and the other
       states concerned to draw a line under World War II and to have a German peace settlement on
       the basis of the situation which exists as a result of that war. That would be in the
       interest of both of our countries.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the second point he wished to
       make was related to non-dissemination and to the general situation in Europe as well. The
       Soviet Union saw a great danger in the plans for providing the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> with access to nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union was not concerned over this
       because the existing correlation of forces would change. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would not become stronger as a result of the implementation of those plans, but
       the possibilities for provocation by the Germans would greatly increase and the situation in
       Europe would become much more acute. He continued that the Soviet Union would welcome it if
       common language could be found on a German peace settlement and on the question of
       non-proliferation. He wondered whether the President could state his views on these points,
       noting that he had another brief point to raise later.</p>
                        <p>The President reiterated that we were greatly concerned about the fact that the Chinese had
       developed and exploded their nuclear device, and that we wanted to do everything possible to
       prevent any other power from following the Chinese example. We realized that the more nations
       possessed nuclear weapons, the greater the danger, and we would not do anything which would
       increase that capacity. The U.K. <pb n="199" xml:id="pg_199" facs="0227"/>now wished to
       minimize its effort in the nuclear weapons field, and we did not want to stimulate the
       Germans to exercise the capacity we knew they could possess. The President said he had tried
       to be very patient during his service as President, and we now had the U.K. discussing the
       problem with the Germans rather than Uncle Sam having to indicate any particular conduct. Of
       course, there were some who wanted to encourage the Germans to build up their own capacity.
       We were trying to counter this because we saw what happened in China. Thus, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> could be sure that we were genuine and sincere in our
       attempts to keep nuclear weapons from spreading. We recognized the tremendous power the
       Soviet Union had, and we also recognized our own tremendous power. We were not anxious at all
       to see the number of nuclear powers increase. He assured Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that we did not want to encourage the proliferation process. The
       President said he was happy that both sides now seemed to be in agreement as to the
       importance of non-proliferation, and his people would be encouraged by what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had said on this point. As to Germany, we would be glad
       to receive any new ideas the Soviet Union might have on the German problem. Of course, we
       were familiar with the standing Soviet position that both German states should be recognized.
       The President said he did not believe much progress could be made on that basis. If the
       Soviet Union had any new ideas, he would ask the Secretary to stop traveling all over the
       world and get busy studying them.</p>
                        <p>Reverting to non-proliferation, the President said we did not have in mind to give the
       Germans nuclear technology or to encourage nuclear aspirations in any other way. What we were
       trying to do was to deter them from seeking an independent capability and to forestall any
       pressures that might develop in that direction. The U.K. was now prepared to give up its
       independent capability and to get out of the picture; what we wanted to do was to prevent the
       Germans from getting into the picture. In this effort, we needed Soviet encouragement and
       maybe even their prayers. For, as frequently is the case in negotiations, we were not in
       complete agreement with our partners in the course of the past two days'
       discussions. The pressure for an independent nuclear capability in Germany was not strong
       today, but it could become so quickly in the absence of our leadership.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> commented that while it was true that
       both sides said they were in favor of non-proliferation, they were in agreement only in
       theory and their actions were in different directions. The President had said the Germans
       might follow the Chinese example; however, the Soviet Union was providing an alternative,
       namely, a broad non-proliferation agreement. As to new ideas on the German problem, Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that if the exchange of views on the
       German problem continued, he did not exclude the possibility of the Soviet Union's
        <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0228"/>putting forward new considerations on some points,
       particularly on the question of the Western forces in West Berlin.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that he would have discussions with his colleagues shortly and that
       he would be in touch with the Soviet side.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then said he wished to comment on the
       situation in the Caribbean. He said the Soviet Union did not want to cast any doubt on the
       President's statement that nothing would be done with respect to Cuba and that
       Cuban internal questions should be decided by the Cubans themselves. Neither did the Soviet
       Union question the President's attitude towards the understanding reached by the
       U.S. and the U.S.S.R. on the Cuban question. However, on behalf of the Soviet Government, he
       did want to draw the President's attention to the fact that the situation in that
       area was not normal and that provocations continued there. The U.S. Government denied that it
       was associated with those events, but the Soviet Government believed that if the U.S.
       Government wanted to put an end to those provocations, they would cease. Another factor was
       that there was an actual economic blockade in effect in that area. All this complicated the
       situation and also indirectly-and he wished to repeat indirectly-complicated U.S.-Soviet
       relations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he wished to point out
       that the Cuban Government, and Fidel Castro personally, had on numerous occasions expressed a
       desire for good relations with the U.S., something the Soviet Union would only welcome.
       Consequently, the ball was now in the U.S. court. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he was drawing the President's attention to all this in
       the sincere hope that the U.S. Government would take steps to improve its relations with
       Cuba.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted that the President had an engagement in a few minutes and that there
       might not be enough time to discuss thoroughly this complex problem here and now. He
       suggested that, if this was agreeable to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>,
       Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and he discuss this matter at a
       later date. He pointed out, however, that we were greatly concerned by Cuban actions and that
       concern had also been expressed at the July meeting of the Foreign Ministers. As far as we
       were concerned, we had repeatedly expressed our interest in peace in the Caribbean area, but
       that was something that depended on all sides.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed that in view of the limited time available, it would not be possible
       to discuss this problem in sufficient detail at this time. If he were to go into detail as
       regards Cuban activities directed against other countries, he would keep seventy freshman
       Congressmen waiting for a full hour. He stressed, however, that we had no aggressive designs
       with respect to Cuba and that he wished the same were true the other way around.</p>
                        <p>The meeting ended at 6:30 p.m.</p>

                        </list>

        found.</note> the following subjects were discussed:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows material on the Congo and foreign aid.]</p>
                        <p>2. I told the President we had completed our series of estimates of Soviet Military
        Posture<note n="3" xml:id="d79fn3">The summary and conclusions of <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11–8–64, “Soviet Capabilities for Strategic Attack,”
        October 8, and the conclusions of <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11–3–64,
        “Soviet Air and Missile Defense Capabilities through Mid-1970,”
        December 16, are scheduled for publication in <ref target="frus1964-68v10">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964–1968, volume X</ref>.</note> and I had
       concluded the Soviets were pursuing a dynamic military program and seem to be oriented more
       toward quality improvements in their offensive and defensive capabilities as contrasted with
       quantitative conditions. I said this did not imply a crash program but we saw no evidence
       that their program was being cut back, diminishing, or resources diverted from the military
       to private sectors. I said I viewed with considerable suspicion <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s statement about a reduction in budget for 1965 and 1966 and
       noted that their military expenditures could easily be hidden in other segments of the
       budget. At this point I said we had noted a continual construction of plutonium-producing
       reactors and the continual expansion of U–235 facilities, despite <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s commitment of January, 1964 to cut back. The President
       asked about the two reactors on which construction was reportedly stopped and I said this was
       very possibly the dual purpose reactors now obsolete which were displayed in Geneva in 1958
       and were to be built at Tomsk in Siberia. I said it was very possible the construction of
       these two reactors had been halted, but we knew the construction was proceeding on more
       modern and more efficiently designed reactors.</p>
                        <p>The President asked if my remarks implied a criticism of our policies and a recommendation
       that they should be reviewed. I said that I had none but that I had not studied our own
       program in detail, except for the stockpile availability of plutonium and <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235. With respect to these materials, I had concluded that our
       resources would vastly exceed the Soviet Union's by 1970 even though we cut back
       our program <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0230"/>and they did not cut back
       their's. Furthermore, I felt we had more than enough to meet our military
       requirements and had advocated a cut back when I was Chairman of the AEC in 1960. With
       respect to our overall program, we must be alert to possible breakthroughs in delivery
       systems and in Air Defense.</p>
                        <p>3. The President raised the question of South Vietnam and I responded that the actions he
       approved were being taken and I would prefer he receive reports through appropriate
       channels.</p>
                        <p>4. The President expressed satisfaction with the intelligence reporting.</p>

                        <p>I visited with Senator <persName corresp="#p_FW1">Fulbright</persName> alone for about an
       hour this morning.<note n="2" xml:id="d80fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> was in Washington for consultations.</note>
       The talk opened with a discussion of the recent Party and governmental changes in Moscow
       during which I replied to the Senator's questions along the lines of the analyses
       in the Embassy's reports.<note n="3" xml:id="d80fn3">See <ref target="#d52">Documents 52</ref>, <ref target="#d57">57</ref>, <ref target="#d60">60</ref>, <ref target="#d65">65</ref>, and <ref target="#d74">74</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_FW1">Fulbright</persName> expressed hope that we would find
       ways to continue the forward movement in Soviet-American relations of the past couple of
       years. He felt that the first six months of the new Congress would be a particularly
       favorable period for a forward movement including pertinent legislative action, saying that
       some of the more difficult elements had been eliminated during the recent elections and that
       the Republican membership is in a somewhat chastened mood.</p>
                        <p>We discussed the possibilities of increased trade relations. I found that the Senator was
       very favorably inclined toward legislation which would give the Executive Branch more
       flexibility in conducting trade negotiations with Eastern Europe, including the Soviet Union.
       He said there would be some flak from people like Senators Mundt and Lausche but did not rule
       out legislation to give to the President authority to extend <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> treatment. In this connection we exchanged observations with respect to visits
       both of us had had with the President of <pb n="203" xml:id="pg_203" facs="0231"/>Business
       International, Mr. Eldridge Haynes, who had recently led a group of outstanding American
       business figures to the Soviet Union. He felt that the members of this group could be very
       helpful in improving the climate in this country with respect to increased trade with the
       U.S.S.R. and other Eastern European countries. He felt that a lend-lease settlement would be
       a very important step in clearing the atmosphere and suggested that if a compromise figure of
       approximately $500,000,000 could be reached, we might be able to find means of making it easy
       for the Soviets to pay over a long period. He had one specific suggestion arising out of his
       conversation with Mr. Haynes, namely that a large part of the lend-lease settlement could be
       made available in rubles for investment by American business enterprises in joint projects
       with the Russians. He was referring in this connection to the interest which had been shown
       on both sides during the Business International seminars in joint research projects and joint
       licensing and world-wide distribution arrangements. Senator <persName corresp="#p_FW1">Fulbright</persName> said he had in mind particularly the example of the method used by the
       Brazilians in compensating American companies for sequestered properties; as in the Brazilian
       case, American firms could reimburse the government for rubles advanced after the ventures
       had become operative and profitable. I undertook to ask the Department to staff out the
       possibilities of this idea and to keep him informed about their conclusions.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_FW1">Fulbright</persName> indicated that he planned to
       proceed with the ratification of the Consular Convention in a normal way shortly after the
       inauguration. I informed him that the Executive Branch was prepared to go ahead with the
       signature and implementation of the long postponed Civil Air Agreement after consulting with
       him, particularly as to whether any problems might be created with respect to the
       ratification process of the Consular Convention. He did not appear to see any real problems
       though I told him I was not myself specifically consulting him on this matter and was not
       asking for his answer at this time. (I assume this will be followed up.)</p>
                        <p>When the conversation touched on our respective plans to play a bit of golf over the
       holidays the Senator deplored the lack of golf courses in the Soviet Union and expressed the
       view that it would do much to calm down the Soviet leadership if we could get them interested
       in playing the game. I told him of my efforts to persuade Deputy Prime Minister Novikov to
       build a golf course in the vicinity of Moscow. The Senator suggested that the Department
       might interest the U.S. Golf Association in this venture. He was sure that the Association
       would be interested in doing some kind of joint project under which it might design and lay
       out a golf course and provide some of the necessary equipment while the Russians would
       provide the land and do the grading and other construction. I told him we would look into
       this <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0232"/>and that this suggestion would give me new
       material for continuing my efforts with Novikov.</p>
                        <p>The Senator inquired about my own plans for being back in this country, indicating that he
       was thinking in terms of possible usefulness of my testimony in connection with legislative
       proposals, including the ratification of the Consular Convention and a possible East-West
       trade legislation. I replied that I had no specific plans though normally I got back at least
       twice a year. I assured him, however, that I could be available on short notice to return if
       this were considered desirable. During the conversation the Senator referred several times to
       his recent visit to Yugoslavia and his talk with Tito and other Yugoslav leaders on that
       occasion. He was impressed by the fact that Tito had been informed of his recent speech in
       Dallas (December 8) and had commented favorably upon it in his (Tito's) remarks to
       the Yugoslav Party Congress.</p>

                        <p>At 1 p.m. on December 19, 1964, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Soviet Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
       met at <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s suite in the Waldorf Astoria
       in New York City for luncheon and discussion. Also present were Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName>,
       Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SVS1">Semenov</persName>, and Soviet
       Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. Topics included the
       just-concluded <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> ministerial meeting in Paris, Vietnam,
       disarmament, Israeli-Arab relations, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development,
       and a possible new isthmus canal. Memoranda of conversation are in the National Archives and
       Records Administration, RG 59, Conference Files: Lot 66 D 110.</p>
                        <p>Concerning Vietnam, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> stressed that
       “a continuation of the tense situation in the area and the actions the U.S. seemed
       to plan with respect to North Vietnam would complicate the situation and create great danger.
       The Soviet Union believed that withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Vietnam would be in the
       interest of South East Asia and of the world at large, as well as in the interest of
       U.S.-Soviet relations. The President had expressed a desire to improve U.S.-Soviet relations.
       It would be a wise move on the part of the U.S. if it were to decide to withdraw its troops
       from South Vietnam.”</p>

                        <p>1. At a private luncheon given by Bill Foster for Tsarapkin today, I spoke to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and told him that you meant every word of what you
       said last night and we hoped very much that the Soviet leaders would wish to come to the
        U.S.<note n="2" xml:id="d82fn2">For text of the State of the Union address, January 4, in
        which the President expressed the hope that the new Soviet leaders could visit the United
        States, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States:
          <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>, 1965</hi>, Book I, pp. 1–9. For
        text of his address on February 3 in which he expanded this suggestion to an exchange of
        visits, see ibid., pp. 126–129.</note> I told him that you would be eager to extend a formal
       invitation if such an invitation would be welcome (this is the standard next step in a dance
       of this sort). He said that while he had no instructions, his government might think that in
       protocol terms the next visit should be by the President to the Soviet Union. I told him that
       we did not think protocol was the point, and he informally agreed.</p>
                        <p>2. He then reminded me that he has asked me about your interest in visiting the Soviet
       Union in a most informal way last summer. I reminded him that I had pointed out the problem
       you faced in 1964, and the further problem that any visit to the Soviet Union would have to
       come after a visit to our Allies in Europe. He then asked if any time had been set for a
       visit to Europe, and I said no. I added that of course in principle I knew you would be
       interested in a visit to the Soviet Union some day if you should be invited, but I repeated
       my suggestion that he should impress upon his government the sincerity of your expressed hope
       that his leaders might wish to visit the U.S. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he would deliver this message.</p>
                        <p>3. The Ambassador then raised the question whether a visit to the U.S. would be just a
       sightseeing expedition or whether there could be serious talks. He said that the impression
       he had in the papers was that we might be merely thinking of seeing the country, and while he
       agreed that this was a good thing, he thought talks might be helpful too. I told him that of
       course you would expect to have serious conversations on serious matters with the Soviet
       leaders if they came here, but I did not <pb n="206" xml:id="pg_206" facs="0234"/>think that
       either side should talk of a visit of this kind as if it were going to be a matter from which
       great conclusions and new decisions would emerge, because neither of us would wish to run the
       risk of disappointing the hopes of our peoples and other peoples by such large anticipations.
       He agreed.</p>
                        <p>4. I think the ball is now safely and clearly in <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s court, and that the likely answer will be some form of
       invitation or half-invitation to you to go to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. That
       will then leave you quite free to make a decision as to which way to play it, and of course
       it is possible that we will get a more affirmative response about the Soviet leadership
       coming here.</p>
                        <p>5. The one thing I have not done is to turn your expression of hope into a formal
       invitation, but I can do this if you would like. My own feeling is that it is better to leave
       the thing in its current informal position for the moment, and Tommy Thompson agrees.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>We had another of those periodic Soviet dinners at <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> last
       night, this time drawing two stellar attractions-<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>.</p>
                        <p>This was better than most of the sessions. There was more give and take and some
       points-some old and some new-were even developed.</p>
                        <p>Recognizing that no one really knew who was in charge in Moscow at this time and reluctant
       to bet on who might be, the consensus was that so long as the leadership was collective,
       Soviet policy would be <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0235"/>marked by orthodoxy, avoiding
       both risky confrontations and new initiatives. Policies would be relatively stable, with the
       Soviet Union reacting rather than acting in international affairs.</p>
                        <p>In order, Soviet priorities were (1) internal political maneuvering for leadership; (2)
       concentration on Soviet bloc developments; (3) concern with the struggle between Moscow and
       Peking; (4) the direction and effectiveness of Moscow's ideological leadership
       over the Communist parties of the world, particularly those outside the bloc; (5)
       collaboration with the underdeveloped world; and lastly, and down at the bottom of the order
       of priorities, contacts with the West.</p>
                        <p>The point was made several times (and there was no dissent) that Soviet leadership of the
       Communist bloc had been seriously fractured, and the Soviets could not hope to recoup the
       lost ground. In fact, the situation would inevitably get worse from the Soviet point of view,
       whether or not the Soviets did anything about it.</p>
                        <p>An immediate case in point is Moscow's March meeting of the Communist parties,
       with the evidence becoming increasingly clear that Moscow was going to come out second best,
       whether or not it actually held the meeting.</p>
                        <p>The struggle with Communist China goes on. The break is irreparable. Moscow has been trying
       to reduce the noise level, to avoid forcing attention on its progressively weaker position.
       But a final split was inevitable and the March meeting was bound to make this fact
       clearer.</p>
                        <p>A look was taken at Moscow's role in Vietnam and the Congo. The consensus was
       that what we were seeing here was Moscow reacting rather than acting. The Congo situation was
       tailor-made for Communist exploitation. Tshombe and the white mercenaries had undone much
       that had been accomplished since 1961. The Soviets had no choice but to participate if only
       to limit the Chinese role.<note n="2" xml:id="d83fn2">For documentation on the situation in
        the Congo, see <ref target="frus1964-68v23">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964–1968, volume XXIII</ref>.</note> In fact,
       the moral drawn was that in its struggle with China, the Soviets under given circumstances
       would tee off on the West to improve its position vis-á-vis Peking. This is the
       rationale for Izvestiya's attack on LBJ.</p>
                        <p>The discussion then moved on to the implications for U.S. policy. <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>
       formed a minority of two-but for different reasons-arguing that nothing should be done in the
       short term. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>'s argument was that the
       U.S. position was so much stronger than the Soviets. By doing nothing we could exploit our
       strength and avoid the pitfalls of helping the Soviets inadvertently. This smacked of U.S.
        <pb n="208" xml:id="pg_208" facs="0236"/>policy of the 1950's and the assembled
       guests told <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> so. <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> also called for no action, but his argument was that the Soviets were
       so beset with other problems, they could not begin to consider Western proposals at this
       time. No one else agreed. Indeed, there was a long discussion on what could be done on the
       assumption that in Moscow's present predicament-before some positions become too
       solid-there might be Soviet receptivity in some areas so long as the Soviet requirements were
       not ignored or their interests apparently jeopardized.</p>
                        <p>The conversation then moved to a long discussion of German reunification and the need from
       the U.S. point of view for doing something. Professor Lowenthal for one argued long and
       effectively that there was enough in the Eastern European revolution, the gradual
       deterioration in the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and Soviet security interests, to
       arrive at a formula that might interest the Soviets and the Germans. He denied categorically
        <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>'s assertion that the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> is becoming stronger economically and politically. Lowenthal
       admitted some economic improvement but stated that the political situation was deteriorating
       and the process of deterioration was likely to be accelerated as Soviet control of Eastern
       Europe (minus <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>) became less effective.</p>
                        <p>The consensus (minus <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>) was that allowing for the fact that the Soviets could
       not do very much between now and the March meetings of Communist parties, it would be a
       mistake for the West to let the Soviets drift by failing to keep them engaged on matters
       which over the long term mean much to us and them.</p>
                        <p> Ray Cline promised notes on the meeting which I will pass to you as soon as I have them in
       readable form.<note n="3" xml:id="d83fn3">Not found.</note>

       liked. They contended Soviet press treatment in natural way criticized those things which
       they disagree with and praised those they approved of. Was quite apparent in number of
       individual conversations that the one most difficult ingredient for Soviets in speech was

       his government was disturbed that the question of improving relations between the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Eastern European countries always seemed to be in the form of

                        <p>Now that Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and Secretary
        <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> have had a series of discussions of our mutual
       problems, I wish to reply to the message from your Government of November 3, 1964,<note n="2" xml:id="d85fn2">
                                <ref target="#d67">Document 67</ref>.</note> which was transmitted through Ambassador
        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. I was particularly pleased to have the
       expression of the interest of your Government in first restraining and limiting the arms
       race, and then decisively reversing it. I think that we can take some satisfaction in the
       fact that both our Governments have been able, without formal agreement, to reduce our
       military budgets by amounts which may be small in relation to our total arms expenditure but
       are nevertheless of some significance in that we have both succeeded in putting an end to the
       annual increases in this heavy burden. I am able to tell you now that our budget for the
       fiscal year 1965 will call for expenditures in our Department of Defense of $47.9 billion,
       which is more than $2 billion less than was requested in my budget submitted to the Congress
       in January 1964.</p>
                        <p>As I have already touched upon disarmament questions in my New Year's message to
        you,<note n="3" xml:id="d85fn3">For text of this message, December 30, 1964, see Department
        of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, January 18, 1965, pp. 74–75.</note> I will not
       discuss them further at this time, other than to say that I continue to believe deeply that
       there would be advantage to us all in progress toward the specific arrangements I have
       proposed. In particular, we are convinced that the interest of our two peoples, and indeed of
       all mankind, would be advanced by steps beyond the limited test ban treaty to prevent the
       dissemination of nuclear weapons. I am able to confirm to you once again that it is this
       fundamental policy that underlies all our actions in this field, including those about which
       your Government has expressed concern, in the area of the nuclear defense of the members of
       the North Atlantic Alliance. I remain convinced that if we work together with the common <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0239"/>purpose of opposing the proliferation of nuclear
       weapons, we should be able to eliminate misunderstandings between us and serve our common
       interests.</p>
                        <p>I fully share your view that agreements reached between our Governments should be honestly
       observed by both sides, and I can assure you of our good faith on this score. Many of the
       problems which today plague the world, and which in one way or another involve the Soviet
       Union and the United States, are highly complex, both in their origins and in their
       ramifications. I am hopeful, however, that with good will on both sides, a steady and
       consistent effort to resolve them can succeed. We shall, of course, have to proceed step by
       step, but every success will, in my opinion, make the remaining problems easier to resolve.
       You may be sure that I am determined to persevere on this path.</p>
                        <p>I am concerned that the United Nations has not yet been able to resolve the problem related
       to Article 19 of the Charter. I can assure you that our position on this question is one
       based on both principle and a consideration of the practical consequences of a failure to
       uphold the Charter as we see it. Our position is not in any sense directed against the Soviet
       Union, and on the contrary, I regret that an issue of this seriousness has arisen and
       particularly that we are obliged to deal with it so soon after the constitution of new
       governments in both of our countries. In our handling of the matter in New York, we are
       seeking a solution which would not prejudice either your or our positions of principle.</p>
                        <p>I am hopeful that we can continue to make progress in our strictly bilateral relations. In
       this field, I intend to press forward in an effort to develop our trade relations. There are
       many difficulties, but if the international political atmosphere remains calm, I believe
       there is a good prospect of improvement. We consider that this field is important both
       because of the practical advantages of peaceful commerce and because of the high value of
       active, peaceful, and straightforward relations between the citizens of our two countries.
       For these same reasons I shall continue to give my strong support to the increase of cultural
       and technical exchanges between our peoples. And in this connection I have recently had most
       interesting talks with my Science Advisor, Dr. Hornig, and those who accompanied him on his
       important visit to the Soviet Union. I have also listened with great interest to the
       encouraging reports of the distinguished group of American businessmen which had the
       advantage of a meeting with you and many of your associates at the end of last year.</p>
                        <p>In this same spirit I have expressed my hope for a visit from your side to the United
       States. I believe that such a visit would allow us to have serious and constructive
       discussions together. It would also allow us a chance to show you the real dedication to
       freedom and peace <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0240"/>of the American people, who share
       with the people of the Soviet Union such great responsibilities for the future of mankind. If
       this hope should meet with a positive response from the Soviet Government, it would be a
       great satisfaction to propose definite times and to offer a more formal invitation.<note n="4" xml:id="d85fn4">Printed from an unsigned copy.</note>

       reminding that Secretary expected to take holiday after inauguration and hoped <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would facilitate his plans by settling <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> financial crisis and keeping lid on generally. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> rejoined that this depended on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and said he assumed I had returned from Washington with lots of news.</p>
                        <p>I reported briefly on the results my conversations with regard to prospects early
       ratification consular convention and, as President had informed <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>,<note n="2" xml:id="d86fn2">See <ref target="#d78">Document

        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> of concern which had been expressed to me
       both by President and Secretary over the recent sharp tone in Soviet press, particularly with
       regard to State of Union message.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> regretted that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> press has seen fit to report almost exclusively on the critical aspects of
       reaction in Soviet press to President's message and to say almost nothing about
       positive Soviet treatment. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> wished me to know
       that the Soviet Govt has reacted favorably to the President's remarks with regard
       to desirability of improving bilateral relations and readiness establish contacts in summit
       level. He suggested this would probably be reflected still more in press in future. Naturally
       the Soviet Govt had noted that the message reflected no change in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy toward certain areas of the world—e.g. south-east
       Asia—but <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had already fully

                        <p>I pointed out to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that obviously time and

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> came in at his own request and referred to
       conversations he had had with McGeorge Bundy and separately with me after the
       President's State of the Union Message. In my conversation with him at that time,
       he had asked about the possibility of the President visiting the Soviet Union. I said I could
       only give him a personal guess which was that the President would probably wish to make one
       or more visits to our principal European Allies before making a visit to the Soviet Union if
       such a visit should be desired. When he pressed further on the question of timing of a visit
       either way, I said again, emphasizing that I was speaking personally, that I assumed that his
       people would be preoccupied with the meeting of the Communist Parties, set for March
       first.</p>
                        <p>In his statement to me today, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he
       wished to tell me that he was sure that his Government would consider that a visit by the
       President to the Soviet Union would be in the interests of peace and of good relations
       between our two countries and that if I could tell him that the President would be interested
       in making such a visit, he would inform his Government and he felt certain that the response
       would be positive. When I pointed out that his remarks made no reference to a Soviet visit to
       this country, he said that he assumed that there would be an exchange of visits.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he thought the remarks he had made
       to me today were not in response to the message from the President I had delivered to him on

                                <ref target="#d85">Document 85</ref>.</note> and he assumed that this message would be
       studied and a reply made in due course.</p>
                        <p>I said I would of course report his remarks and would probably be in touch with him at a

                        </p>
                        <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>A. Foreign policy was not a principal cause of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s downfall. Nor does his removal alter the main factors
       which have shaped the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s external policies
       for the last two years. Nevertheless, the end of one-man rule does have important
       implications for Soviet conduct. A collective leadership tends to be more conservative and
       less venturesome, though this does not mean inactivity or an inability to make decisions. But
       we expect that within the formal framework of collectivity a power struggle will develop, and
       during this phase the chances will probably increase for sharp fluctuations in policy. In any
       case, the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> posture will be an important factor in
       influencing rival groups. (Paras. 1, 3–6)</p>
                        <p>B. Tensions in the Communist world will also continue to be among the most important
       factors in the Soviet outlook. Assertion of national self-interest is growing in Eastern
       Europe, and the new Soviet leaders are even less likely than <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to cope with it effectively. As the succession period in Soviet
       politics unfolds, East European nationalism may be moved to bolder ventures. As for
       Sino-Soviet relations <pb n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0244"/>the Soviets have demonstrated
       anew since <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s removal that the
       conflict is fundamental and will continue to have contradictory consequences for policy. They
       will try to compete more effectively with Peiping for influence over existing nationalist
       regimes and revolutionary movements. A sharp crisis in Sino-Soviet relations, on the other
       hand, could push the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> into a new search for agreements
       with the West. (Paras. 8–14)</p>
                        <p>C. The short-term outlook is for a continuation of the main lines of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s policies. In their relations with the
       West, we believe that the new Soviet leaders will neither seek direct confrontations nor be
       able to make significant concessions on major issues. The underdeveloped areas will remain
       the main arenas for the Soviets in the double contest against the West and China, and they
       will pursue an anti-Western policy in Africa and the Middle East with special vigor. In some
       cases, such as the Congo, where the risks appear manageable and proxies are available, the
       new Soviet leaders may be more forceful than <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in exploiting opportunities. (Paras. 16–21, 24–32, 35)</p>
                        <p>D. In Latin America, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s fall
       has probably reinforced Castro's caution toward bringing on a direct clash with
       the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. More recently, Havana has implicitly agreed to forego
       interference in the affairs of the established Communist parties which, in turn, have agreed
       to undertake propaganda efforts to break down Cuba's diplomatic isolation and
       reduce <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> economic pressures. (Paras. 33–34)</p>
                        <p>E. The course and outcome of a power struggle could produce important changes in the
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> line over the long term, and perhaps even
       in the short run. During 1965 pressure on the collective leadership will be mounting as they
       face important economic and political choices connected with holding the party congress
       required by statute and presenting the new Five-Year economic plan. These events could become
       a political catalyst. We think that important pressures in the Soviet scene and the
       international setting will eventually favor the chances for a new Soviet effort to make the
       relaxation of tensions with the West the basis of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s foreign policy. But any such evolution would probably be a
       long-term process and subject to temporary setbacks and even reversals. (Paras. 22–23)</p>
                        <p rend="center">Discussion</p>
                        <p>1. Why and how <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was disposed of is still
       not completely clear. A consistent element in various Soviet explanations, however, has been
       a denial that the substance of foreign policy, as distinct from its conduct, was a root
       cause. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was evidently charged with imposing
       personal decisions or bungling specific operations, but there has been no condemnation of the
       main lines of his foreign policies. <pb n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0245"/>Indeed, the new
       leadership has from the outset labored to reassure a wide variety of governments that it
       intends no changes and will honor previous commitments. It does not now appear that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was removed from power to open the way for any
       sweeping alteration of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s foreign
       policy.</p>
                        <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Factors Affecting the Soviet Outlook</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. A year ago we estimated that the various considerations which had led to a reduction of
       East-West tensions were not merely transitory and would almost certainly continue to
       determine Soviet policy for some time.<note n="3" xml:id="d88fn3">
                                <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11–9–64, “Soviet Foreign Policy,”
        dated 19 February 1964, Secret. [Footnote in the source text. <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11–9–64 is <ref target="#d11">Document 11</ref>.]</note> The fall of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> of course creates a new situation, but it does not
       alter the principal factors which have shaped Soviet foreign policy for the last two years.
       Chief among these are the constraints imposed by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s unfavorable power relationship with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. Moreover, the difficulties of the Soviet economy, the clash with Communist
       China, and assertiveness in Eastern Europe are problems inherent in the development of the
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> since Stalin's death. We believe that
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s successors recognize that
       these problems cannot be resolved merely by a change in leadership.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Internal Politics</hi>. During the next months and perhaps for a few
       years, internal politics are likely to influence the formulation of foreign policy much more
       than during the last years of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. At present
       there appears to be a collective leadership with no clearly dominant figure. Moreover, the
       present leaders have an interest in preventing the rise of another <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and in consolidating their own positions. They are
       likely to be careful to avoid arousing the suspicions of their colleagues, and they may even
       attempt to create political and institutional barriers against one-man rule. A true
       collective leadership, however, is probably not durable. Party tradition is against it; the
       inherent tension between the party and government machineries is against it; the absence of
       systemic checks on power is against it; the simple need for a point of authority to resolve
       disputes and provide decisions is against it. Thus collective rule will probably become the
       formal framework for a power struggle.</p>
                        <p>4. Such a struggle is unpredictable in its course, its duration, and its outcome. It could
       lead in a straight line to the eventual emergence of a single ruler with powers approximating
       those which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> amassed. It could pass through
       cycles in which factions or individuals gain strength but cannot preserve it. But it is also
       possible that, if stalemate persists, the leaders ultimately will develop rules which
       formalize and perpetuate a distribution of power among various top positions. <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0246"/>Until it is resolved, however, this situation provides an
       element of uncertainty in foreign as well as domestic affairs.</p>
                        <p>5. While clean distinctions cannot be drawn, periods of relatively stable collectivity and
       periods of intense struggle probably have different consequences for foreign policy. It is
       already clear that collectively need not mean diplomatic paralysis; the new leaders have
       displayed considerable activity and have shown themselves able to make several tactical
       choices. In general, however, during a period of stable collectivity each member of the group
       will probably tend to avoid sponsoring major initiatives which could cost him supporters and
       position. Thus the outlook in such a period is for limited undertakings and gradual changes.
       The pressure of the group probably reduces the chances of a major crisis produced by
       aggressive Soviet action, but in the same way it also sets a limit on movement in the
       opposite direction.</p>
                        <p>6. When the struggle for power is in its more active phases, however, individuals will tend
       to seek support by gathering political issues into a factional platform. This kind of
       struggle tends to create a conservative-radical rivalry, albeit with frequent
       inconsistencies. There will be a temptation to use foreign as well as internal issues in the
       contest, much as <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> did during his own rise to
       power. Moreover, the necessity of making foreign policy decisions in response to new
       situations could also aggravate or even provoke the contest for leadership. In these
       circumstances, the chances for important changes in policy will increase. It is difficult to
       foresee what specific issues might be drawn into the conflict, but in general the issues are
       likely to arise in terms of what risks the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should
       accept or what price it must pay to achieve its objectives. In any event, whether the issues
       involve tactics or broader strategies, the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> posture, posing
       alternatives to the contending factions, will inevitably play an important role at this
       stage.</p>
                        <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Economic Problems</hi>. The concern of the new leadership with
       economic problems has been quite apparent in their first pronouncements and actions.<note n="4" xml:id="d88fn4">Our current views on the Soviet economy are contained in <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11–5–65, “Soviet Economic Problems and
        Prospects,” dated 22 January 1965, Secret. [Footnote in the source text. A copy
        of this <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> is in the Johnson Library, National Security
        File, National Intelligence Estimates.]</note> As far as the effect of economic problems on
       foreign policy is concerned, the growth of defense spending and its impact on other sectors
       of the economy remains one of the principal long-term issues. An attempt to reduce defense
       expenditures, or even to check their growth, calls for an international atmosphere in which
       such an effort can be justified. Moreover, efforts to restore economic growth rates,
       modernize and re-equip Soviet industry, and improve the agricultural <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219" facs="0247"/>situation, depend in part on purchasing equipment and
       technology from advanced industrial countries on favorable credit terms. This too calls for
       an appropriate international atmosphere. In sum, the nature of Soviet economic problems puts
       some check on an aggressive foreign policy, particularly in Europe. But it is not a factor
       which strongly impels the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> toward a broad and genuine
       improvement in relations with the West or inhibits Moscow in its exploitation of
       opportunities in the underdeveloped areas.</p>
                        <p>8. <hi rend="italic">The China Problem</hi>. One of the first consequences of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s overthrow was the postponement of a
       showdown with Peiping. Formal contacts with the Chinese party were re-established. The
       result, however, has been to show that the conflict is fundamental, that the role of
       personalities is secondary, and that freedom of maneuver is limited on both sides.
       Peiping's terms are virtually unconditional surrender; nothing short of a major
       reorientation of Soviet policies is likely to placate the present Chinese leaders. There may
       still be some Soviets who would be willing to make concessions to bring the Chinese challenge
       under control, but it is almost certain that no member of the political elite who came
       forward with a program to meet Chinese demands could escape damaging charges of appeasement.
       The conflict with China will continue, though it may now vary more in intensity and tactical
       maneuvering.</p>
                        <p>9. This conflict will continue to have contradictory consequences for Soviet policy. On the
       one hand, it is clear that the Soviets are not going to compete with China by adopting the
       extreme revolutionary militancy which Peiping advocates against the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. On the other hand, Chinese activity in the African and Asian areas calls forth
       competitive Soviet efforts to gain greater influence over existing regimes and revolutionary
       movements.</p>
                        <p>10. The Soviets will try to maintain the concept of an international Communist movement,
       but they probably have little hope of reconstituting it as a cohesive united force. The
       Chinese challenge in the international Communist movement is a factor in continuing Soviet
       reluctance to confront the growing nationalism of Eastern Europe or to discipline Castro. In
       addition, Soviet loss of control over the Communist parties of Japan and Indonesia probably
       leads to a more conciliatory attitude toward the governments of those countries.
       Occasionally, the Soviet effort to make a record against Chinese attacks leads to verbal
       ugliness toward the West or diplomatic maneuvers such as the recent endorsement of
       Peiping's proposal for a world conference to ban nuclear weapons. But a sharp
       crisis on the Sino-Soviet front could be an important factor in moving the Soviets to improve
       relations with the West, or even to find parallel interests for an agreement with the Western
       powers.</p>

                        <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Eastern Europe</hi>. The increasingly complicated environment in
       which Soviet policy must operate was illustrated by the diverse and often hostile reaction
       among foreign Communists to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
       dismissal. This change from obedient compliance to reactions reflecting independent
       self-interest has its most important consequences in Eastern Europe. Those leaders in Eastern
       Europe who criticized Soviet methods and credited <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> for his accomplishments have gained stature in their own parties.
       Moreover, a clamor for policy reassurances had to be quickly satisfied, and the refusal of
       many Communist leaders to accept the Soviet version of events in Moscow may have cut short an
       incipient campaign of de-Khrushchevization in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. All
       this served to confirm the trends toward national autonomy in international communism.</p>
                        <p>12. If <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> could not control or divert the
       revival of national consciousness and independent interests in Eastern Europe, his successors
       are even less likely to, because of their own internal weaknesses and lesser prestige. There
       are no indications that the new Soviet leaders mean to try to reimpose a strict authority,
       and the East European parties do not appear to expect such a turn. Recognizing <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s failures to cope with the situation
       through sporadic and sometimes heavy-handed interventions, the new Soviet leaders will
       probably accommodate themselves to a good deal of change, trying the while to shape this
       change in a way which preserves their most important interests.</p>
                        <p>13. Last year we estimated that Soviet policy could probably accept such an accommodation,
       provided that the Eastern European regimes did not transgress the limits of remaining
       avowedly Communist and retaining at least formal membership in the Warsaw Pact. But we also
       estimated that a succession crisis in Soviet politics would pose a particular threat to
       stability in Eastern Europe.<note n="5" xml:id="d88fn5">See <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 12–64, “Changing Patterns in Eastern Europe,” dated 22
        July 1964, Secret. [Footnote in the source text. A copy of this <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> is ibid. The Conclusions section is printed in <ref target="frus1964-68v17#d7">

                        <p>14. We continue to believe that, as the succession period unfolds. East European
       nationalism may be moved to bolder ventures. Rumania's attitude toward the Warsaw
       Pact, for example, confronts the Soviet leaders with a critical situation in their own
       alliance. These circumstances add to the inhibitions against abrupt shifts in general Soviet
       foreign policy. Meanwhile, a solid front on foreign policy issues will probably become
       increasingly difficult to achieve, especially on moves which would raise tensions in Europe
       and run counter to East European desires for better relations with the West. From time to
       time, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> may forego opportunities for improved
       relations with the West in order to avoid encouraging similar moves in Eastern Europe.</p>
                        <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221" facs="0249"/>
                        <p>15. <hi rend="italic">The Non-Communist World</hi>. The various constraints on Soviet
       policy discussed above are offset to some extent by the increasing fluidity of the
       international scene. In the West, the continuing problems of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> alliance provide both opportunities and challenges to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Like <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, the
       new Soviet leaders probably see greater room and greater need for diplomatic maneuver, now
       that important Western elections have been held. They almost certainly are searching for an
       effective way to exploit the independent policies of de Gaulle. In the underdeveloped areas,
       changing times and conditions also offer chances for important gains in the double
       competition with the West and with China. Moreover, the increasing instability in many areas
       of the world can create unexpected situations forcing the Soviets into new modes of operation
       and into new lines of policy. The external situation therefore continues to draw Soviet
       policy into action and tactical maneuver wherever it can be applied.</p>
                        <p>II. <hi rend="italic">The Outlook for Soviet Policy</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>16. As the new Soviet leaders survey their general situation, they are likely to recognize
       that the room for major substantive change is limited. Compared with the situation after
       Stalin's death, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> now has a global range
       of contacts, commitments, and responsibilities. The course of Soviet policy, especially since
       the Cuban missile crisis, has been not merely the personal predilection of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> but a considered, though sometimes erratic, effort
       to cope with accumulated problems and pressures. Changes in the leadership could produce
       important changes in policy, but we think that, at least in the short run, the outlook is for
       a continuation of the main lines of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s policies, with modifications confined to matters of
       emphasis and tactical conduct.</p>
                        <p>17. We doubt that the new leaders see the question of peace and war much differently than
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> did after the Cuban crisis. We think they
       appreciate that their unfavorable power relationship with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> argues against a policy of confrontation, and they are not likely to seek open
       challenges carrying high risks of war with the West. They probably will try to keep open the
       lines of contact and exchange with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and continue with
       small bilateral agreements. At the same time, the new leaders may feel that they are somewhat
       on the defensive after the overthrow of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>,
       and that the West may be tempted to take advantage of the change in regime and the potential
       instability of collective leadership. Moreover, they may be dubious about the benefits of
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s more conciliatory attitude
       toward the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. Such feelings, together with the built-in
       inhibitions against experimentation in a collective leadership, will tend to limit the
       chances of concessions to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and the West. There will
       probably be much less talk about the relaxation of tension already achieved or the prospects
       for further <pb n="222" xml:id="pg_222" facs="0250"/>progress. The general image of the West
       will probably be presented in more orthodox Communist terms, and the Khrushchevian
       preoccupation with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations as the focal point of
       policy may be diminished. For a time, therefore, <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet
       relations will probably be somewhat cooler.</p>
                        <p>18. In the underdeveloped areas, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was
       personally identified with the inception and development of a vigorous challenge to Western
       interests. Within the past year or so, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
       brought Soviet policy further along with practical and ideological innovations designed to
       draw nationalist regimes into even closer relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. This new approach involves playing down the creation of a Communist movement
       in most of Africa, especially in countries ruled by a one-party nationalist movement. Instead
       of competing directly as a rival political force, local Communists are probably now
       encouraged by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to join and work within the ruling
       party. As a corollary, doctrinal changes are paving the way to acknowledging such governments
       as Algeria and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> as in some sense
       “socialist” and therefore acceptable as participants in a loose
       international grouping centered on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>19. This approach removes several obstacles which formerly hampered Soviet policy and
       offers a new basis for extending Moscow's influence in the new nations. On the
       other hand, it probably is ideologically disquieting to some Communists, and it has the
       disadvantages of indirection: success may accrue more to the nationalists, who are at bottom
       unreliable allies, than to the Soviets. Moreover, it involves a continuation of expensive
       foreign aid programs, which have drawn criticism upon <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in the past, and the probability that each new opportunity will call
       for large new commitments of aid.</p>
                        <p>20. Despite misgivings of this kind, we believe that the new leaders intend to sustain a
       vigorous policy in the underdeveloped areas, including the innovations recently introduced
       under <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. They almost certainly believe that
       these areas are the main arenas in the contest with the West as well as with China. Pressure
       from China alone requires the most effective use of the various propaganda, economic, and
       political instruments of Soviet policy. In some cases, where the risks appear manageable, the
       Soviets may exploit revolutionary situations more intensely, especially through proxies as in
       the Congo. Relations with existing nationalist regimes will be tightened whenever possible,
       and ideological gaps are likely to be bridged by further modifications in Soviet thinking.
       Economic and especially military aid will continue to be important tools of Soviet foreign
       policy.</p>
                        <p>21. The working out of Soviet policy in the Afro-Asian areas will depend greatly on the
       more or less accidental occurrences of opportunities and on the actions of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. Any number of critical situations <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0251"/>in Africa, Asia, or even Latin America could develop in such a way that the
       Soviets would be tempted or feel compelled to take advantage of them despite the possibility
       of jeopardizing their general relations with the West. Moreover, they might calculate their
       interests and the attendant risks much differently than <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> actions will, therefore, be a
       major factor in how the Soviets assess their net gain. They will continue to stretch the
       concept of peaceful coexistence so as to permit them to pursue vehement anti-Western policies
       in the underdeveloped areas without paying a price in their direct relations with the West.
       They will study with great care the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> reaction to such events
       as their indirect intervention in the Congo.</p>
                        <p>22. A special problem facing the new Soviet leaders is the obligation, if party statutes
       are to be observed, to hold a party congress in 1965. This would be a normal occasion for
       presenting the outline of a new Five-Year economic plan for 1966–1970. These events might
       serve as a political catalyst, much as the first congress after Stalin's death was
       a turning point in <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s career and
       in post-Stalin policy. Some of the most contentious issues in Soviet policy will be up for
       decision, and many of these issues touch importantly on those vested interest groups, such as
       the military or heavy industry cliques, that could become significant elements in a power
       struggle. The Soviets will be deciding such crucial matters as long-term investment
       priorities, trends of defense spending, and requirements for Western credits and
       technological assistance, and all these have some bearing on foreign relations. In addition,
       the pressures for major change in policies could be heightened by a new crisis in the
       Sino-Soviet conflict or within the Communist world.</p>
                        <p>23. Over the longer run, the direction of any major change in foreign policy would depend
       greatly on the course of an internal struggle, which we cannot predict with any confidence.
       For example, this struggle could be won by a leader or a faction advocating tougher policies
       abroad. Or a faction advocating one approach, could gain power only to shift tactics, much as
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> did. We think that important pressures in
       the Soviet scene and the international setting do favor the chances for a new Soviet effort
       to make the relaxation of tensions with the West the basis of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s foreign policy. But any such evolution would probably be a
       long-term process and subject to temporary setbacks and even reverses.</p>
                        <p>III. <hi rend="italic">Tactics in the Near Term</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>24. In <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s day, the
       non-Communist world came to have some fairly clear ideas about the tactical play of Soviet
       policies. Particularly after the missile crisis of 1962, it could be estimated with some
       confidence that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> respected certain levels of
       risks, whether <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0252"/>in Berlin, Cuba, the Congo,
       Indonesia, or Vietnam. There is no reason to believe that his successors have greatly
       different notions of how far they can press in critical situations; in fact, their criticism
       of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s impetuosity suggests that
       they may be more cautious and less bellicose in a crisis. Yet they are untried, and the
       change of command in Moscow adds an element of uncertainty to estimating Soviet tactics,
       whether in ordinary negotiations or in crises.</p>
                        <p>25. <hi rend="italic">Arms Control</hi>. In this field Soviet tactics will probably become
       less flamboyant with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> gone, though probably
       not much different in substance. Current statements continue the emphasis on partial measures
       and the route of mutual example. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> seems to be ready
       to make annual reductions in its overt defense budget if the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> does likewise. Even if such reductions are more apparent than real, they
       establish a certain atmosphere and point up the possibility that the Soviets may be
       responsive to other <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> initiatives of this type.</p>
                        <p>26. Beyond such unilateral and uncontrolled steps, however, we see only a small chance for
       major developments while the internal political situation remains uncertain. A reluctance to
       alienate the military establishment could be an important factor in preventing Soviet
       concessions. This factor will grow if the political leaders are divided and begin seeking
       elements of support outside the party apparatus. There may also be an effort to use
       disarmament negotiations in the Sino-Soviet quarrel, by trying to appear responsive to
       Chinese proposals and participation. Finally, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s attitude towards arms control agreements will be affected by
       developments with respect to nuclear sharing in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>27. Nevertheless, we think that over the longer term economic considerations and political
       reasons—such as the desire to isolate China—will lead the Soviet Union
       to consider further arms control agreements. We believe that even in the period of this
       estimate the Soviets might find one or another of the proposals already under discussion
       suitable as a next step and might accordingly display some new flexibility in negotiations.
       In particular, we believe that the proposals for the destruction of bombers and for a
       comprehensive nuclear test ban would be likely candidates. Thus far, however, there are no
       indications that the Soviets intend to change their position on inspection or verification of
       arms control measures.</p>
                        <p>28. <hi rend="italic">The <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Area</hi>. In the near
       term, Soviet policy toward <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is likely to be dominated by
       the campaign against the various proposals for nuclear sharing in the Western alliance. The
       Soviets probably recognize that multilateral arrangements are preferable to more direct forms
       of German access to nuclear weapons and strategic planning; they may regard some sort of
       multilateral force as the least undesirable of these proposals. But for the Soviets these are
       at present unimportant <pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225" facs="0253"/>details; they regard any form
       of German participation in the strategic forces of the West as a major challenge to their
       interests and are bent on preventing it altogether.</p>
                        <p>29. We expect a vigorous campaign of propaganda, threats, and inducements to inject the
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> into Western counsels. European security proposals are
       likely to be the heart of Soviet diplomatic efforts to delay or defeat an <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>-type project. The Soviets are likely to give more attention to
       the British Labor government as a potential partner in discussions on European security. At
       the same time, direct dealings with Bonn have been toned down while overtures to de Gaulle
       are being strengthened. The Warsaw Pact will probably be brought in for more attention, and
       some steps may be taken to create an impression of nuclear countermeasures to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> in the eastern alliance. Finally, there could be pressure for
       East-West negotiations before the West German elections.</p>
                        <p>30. Inevitably, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s European policy is
       limited by its rigid stand on Germany. Yet the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> effort and
       its broader political implications and the coming German elections are important challenges
       to devise new approaches. The new attitude of Bonn toward Eastern Europe is a tempting
       opportunity to channel German thinking into new experiments in dealing with East Germany and
       the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> over reunification. And there is little doubt that
       the effort to court the West Berlin authorities and to play Berlin against Bonn, Brandt
       against Erhard, will be continued. Yet <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s effort to reactivate German policy by a direct approach
       to Bonn caused considerable apprehension in East Berlin and gave the Chinese a chance to feed
        <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>'s latent fears that Moscow would
       eventually abandon the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The new leaders will probably
       want to appear beyond suspicion and to reassert the basic principle of a divided Germany.
        <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>'s demeanor suggests they have
       already done so. Moreover, the fluid situation in Eastern Europe makes any tampering with the
       political status quo in Central Europe even more unsettling. The immediate effect of
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s fall, therefore, probably has
       been to narrow Soviet freedom of action on Germany.</p>
                        <p>31. One possible response to conflicting pressures is to challenge the West in its most
       vulnerable area, Berlin. On this narrower question the Soviets do have more flexibility than
       on the broad question of Germany. Thus far the new Soviet leaders have been far from
       threatening over Berlin and have even hinted that they might scale down their position in
       negotiations. Brandt's role as chairman of the SPD and governing mayor of Berlin
       is a continuing opportunity for Soviet démarches, particularly in an election
       year. We think, however, that any Soviet activity on Berlin will have little substance, and
       that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will be maneuvering rather than looking for
       real progress toward an <pb n="226" xml:id="pg_226" facs="0254"/>acceptable German
       settlement. Nor do we foresee that such activity will occur in an atmosphere of grave
       crisis.</p>
                        <p>32. <hi rend="italic">Southeast Asia</hi>. One of the more evident shifts in tactics that
       has already occurred is the Soviet stand on the continuing crisis in Indo-China. The new
       leaders are trying to play a more active role to discourage the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> from broadening the war and to promote negotiations of some kind. This change
       probably reflects their belief that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had
       left a dangerous situation largely in the hands of Peiping and had perhaps even encouraged
       the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to be more aggressive by his responses in past
       incidents. An urgent Soviet motive may also be fear that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and China are pointing for a showdown with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. Moreover, in the context of playing down the public dispute with China, the
       Soviets will probably try to regain some influence in Hanoi, hoping to provide a political
       alternative for any faction in the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> that opposes complete
       reliance on Peiping. Depending on their success in this approach and on their estimate of
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Chinese intentions, the Soviets may try to increase
       their leverage by providing some direct military aid to Hanoi. But we doubt that the Soviets
       will undertake the military defense of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> or run very
       high risks to protect it.</p>
                        <p>33. <hi rend="italic">Cuba</hi>. This is still a dangerous involvement of Soviet interests
       in an exposed position, and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> still desires to
       stabilize Cuban-American relations. The Soviets will probably press moderation on both Castro
       and the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, but Cuban control of the SAM system and the
       continuation of <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-2 flights are the ingredients of a crisis
       which Castro could provoke at any time. According to Castro's own account,
       however, he has given some commitment to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> not to use
       the SAMs against <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> overflights until other means of
       terminating them are exhausted, and the new Soviet leaders will probably try to hold him to
       such a commitment. Castro was reported to have been shaken by the disappearance of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, possibly because he has even less confidence in the
       new Soviet leaders. There have been many indications of frictions between Havana and Moscow,
       to a large extent because of Soviet reluctance to take on any greater economic commitments.
       Thus the effect of the change in leadership in Moscow probably is to reinforce
       Castro's caution toward bringing on a direct clash with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>34. Nevertheless, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has apparently endorsed new
       tactics, agreed to by Latin American Communists late last year, which call for a more
       organized propaganda and agitation in Latin America to break down Cuba's
       diplomatic isolation and reduce <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> economic pressures. In
       addition, Latin American Communists agreed to unite in more active support for the Venezuelan
       revolution; they also specified Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras, Paraguay, and Haiti as targets
       for a more militant struggle. They expressed support for Soviet tactics in handling the
       Chinese and gained an implicit ban on Cuban interference in the <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0255"/>affairs of the established Communist parties. These developments suggest an
       uneasy bargain among the Soviets, Castro and his followers, and the traditional Communist
       leaders of Latin America. We do not believe that they foreshadow important new Soviet
       commitments or risks in Latin America, and the tactics pursued by individual parties will
       continue to be determined primarily by the local situation.</p>
                        <p>35. <hi rend="italic">Africa and the Middle East</hi>. Special mention should be made of
       Soviet policy toward these areas. The growing political instability which seems certain to
       prevail throughout most of Africa provides enhanced opportunities to all varieties of
       radicals, many of whom are not amenable to Soviet control. Exploitation of favorable
       opportunities for the Soviets will be improved if they can continue to work with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and Ben Bella. The prospects for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in Africa are particularly promising from two standpoints.
       Over the next several years, it is possible that one or more radical nationalist regimes will
       of their own accord become largely pro-Soviet. Or it is possible that small cadres of
       Communists could gain power without relying on Communist mass movements or organized parties;
       such subversive elements sympathetic to Moscow will probably grow as students trained in the
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Eastern Europe return to Africa. In either case,
       the Soviets would have to assume economic burdens and to grapple with the questions of
       responsibility for a distant and probably turbulent nation. But the growing appeal of Chinese
       revolutionary thought and the challenge to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will
       spur the Soviets to make even more strenuous efforts to cash in on the rise of radical
       regimes and the wave of anti-Westernism. This policy will be expressed in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as well, where the growing alignment of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the radical Afro-Asians will cause increasing
       difficulties for the West.</p>

                        <p>The current exchange on the possibility of top level visits began with the
       President's State of the Union Message. This was followed up with the
       President's message to the Soviet Government of January fourteenth,<note n="2" xml:id="d89fn2">
                                <ref target="#d85">Document 85</ref>.</note>
                            <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0256"/>in which he referred to his hope for a visit from
       the Soviet side to the United States and said that if this hope should meet with a positive
       response from the Soviet Government, it would be a great satisfaction to propose definite
       times and offer a more formal invitation.</p>
                        <p>On January sixteenth, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> told me that he was
       sure his Government would consider a visit by the President to the Soviet Union would be in
       the interests of peace and good relations between our two countries and that if I could tell
       him the President would be interested, he would inform his Government and was sure the
       response would be positive.<note n="3" xml:id="d89fn3">See <ref target="#d87">Document
         87</ref>.</note> About a week ago, he asked me whether there had been any reaction to this
       inquiry. The January thirty-first article in Pravda stated that the Soviet reaction to the
       President's statements on Soviet/American contacts was
       “positive.”</p>
                        <p>Both you and I have indicated to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
       our personal belief that the President would have to visit our principal European Allies
       before visiting the Soviet Union. Judging from this correspondence, there is a real
       possibility that the Soviets are interested in an early visit to this country but would like
       some indication of the President's willingness to return it before going further.
       I would suggest that I might reply to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> along
       the following lines:</p>
                        <p>The President is, in principle, very much interested in a visit to the Soviet Union and
       hopes that it will be possible to arrange for such a visit before the year is out.<note n="4" xml:id="d89fn4">In forwarding <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>'s
        memorandum to the President on February 2, <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName>
        commented on this suggestion as follows in his covering memorandum: “I doubt if
        we should decide this until we know a little more clearly how many trumpets we may be
        blowing in Southeast Asia.” (Johnson Library, National Security File, Head of
        State Correspondence, Pen Pal Correspondence, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>)</note> In the meantime, the President has instructed me to say that he
       is gratified with the positive reaction to his invitation for a Soviet visit to the United
       States which appeared in a recent issue of Pravda and will be glad to issue a formal
       invitation at any time convenient to the Soviet Government.</p>

                        <p>Your personal message of January 14 of this year<note n="2" xml:id="d90fn2">
                                <ref target="#d85">Document 85</ref>.</note> has been attentively studied by us. On that
       same confidential basis we should like to inform you of the point of view of the Soviet
       Government both regarding the questions raised by you and also regarding several other
       international questions.</p>
                        <p>We received with satisfaction the response, which we found in your message, to the ideas of
       the Soviet Government, which were transmitted to you on November 3, 1964,<note n="3" xml:id="d90fn3">
                                <ref target="#d67">Document 67</ref>.</note> regarding the necessity to resolve ripened
       problems by means of discussions and regarding the importance of honorable observance by both
       sides of agreements already reached between our governments.</p>
                        <p>We agree with the statement contained in your message that measures to prevent the
       dissemination of nuclear weapons would answer the interests of our two peoples and all of
       humanity. In this connection, it goes without saying that there should not be left a single
       chink (for access) to them by states not now possessing such weapons—direct or
       indirect. However, what is now happening in the West is, unfortunately, going in the opposite
       direction.</p>
                        <p>You know what a negative attitude is called forth in the Soviet Union and in countries who
       are our friends and allies by plans to establish <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
       nuclear forces in any of their variations—“multilateral” or
       “Atlantic”. These plans likewise are plans to disseminate nuclear
       weapons, and in the most dangerous region of the world. Giving Western Germany access to
       nuclear weapons, in whatever form it might be planned, we cannot regard as other than a step
       directed against the interests of the security of the Soviet Union and of the countries
       united in the Warsaw Pact organization, as a step strengthening the threat of war.</p>
                        <p>We know that you have a different point of view. You say that between the Governments of
       the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the USA there exists a
       “misunderstanding” <pb n="230" xml:id="pg_230" facs="0258"/>in this
       regard. In our view the case is much more complicated. The Soviet people has its own
       experience-an experience costing millions of lives-with the treachery and aggression of the
       German militarists, whose well-known pretensions, as is widely recognized even in the West,
       mainly stimulate the development of plans for the dissemination of nuclear weapons, for
       example under the flag of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nuclear forces.</p>
                        <p>We should like with all frankness to tell you of our serious concern that in several
       regions of the world and first of all in Southeast Asia there continue to take place cases of
       breaking international agreements and even military actions against the Democratic Republic
       of Vietnam. Such actions cannot fail to call forth a corresponding answering reaction among
       us and among our friends and allies. We are convinced that realism in policy demands
       elimination of the dangerous tension which has arisen in Southeast Asia especially in Vietnam
       and Laos, and that the way out lies in unbending observance of the principle of respect for
       the sovereign rights of peoples and for valid international agreements.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Government considers that at the present moment it would be appropriate to
       separate out from the group of problems which were the subject of an exchange of opinions
       between the Governments of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the USA those
       problems with regard to which it would be possible to reach an understanding. We have been
       successful in reaching an understanding without formal agreement, for example, on the
       question of reducing military budgets. In your message you state that the Government of the
       USA intends to reduce somewhat military expenditures for the 1965 fiscal year, as we have
       also done with regard to the Soviet budget. Our views both with regard to the usefulness of
       this measure as well as with regard to its limited significance, obviously coincide.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Government takes as a point of departure the fact that it is now important to
       develop such concrete and realistic measures as would narrow the scope of the arms race and
       would lay a path toward the resolution of the basic questions of disarmament, toward general
       and complete disarmament. Soviet proposals, which in our opinion serve this goal, were
       presented for the consideration of the XIX Session of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
       General Assembly. The Government of the USA promised to study them. We await the results of
       this study.</p>
                        <p>Some questions concerning the problem of disarmament are touched upon in your New
       Year's message.<note n="4" xml:id="d90fn4">Dated December 30, 1964; for text, see
        Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, January 18, 1965, pp. 74–75.</note> You mentioned, in
       particular, <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0259"/>an inspected world-wide all-inclusive
       prohibition on nuclear weapon testing, a combination of a cut-off in the production of
       fissionable materials for military purposes with measures assuring the peaceful use of
       nuclear energy, and an inspected freeze on strategic delivery systems. The American proposals
       on these questions have already been discussed in detail, as is known, at the disarmament
       negotiations in Geneva, and the positions of the parties on these questions have been fully
       determined. If it is a question of concepts which have not been in the field of view earlier,
       then we are prepared to consider them with full attention.</p>
                        <p>Our opinion concerning the significance and immediacy of the problem of European security
       and a German peace settlement, as well as possible perspectives for discussion of this
       problem, was presented to you personally by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in the conversation of the 9th of December last year.<note n="5" xml:id="d90fn5">
                                <ref target="#d78">Document 78</ref>.</note> Taking cognizance of the statements of the
       Secretary of State for continuing the exchange of views on this question, we confirm our
       readiness for such an exchange of views—for instance with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> in Moscow.</p>
                        <p>A few words about the so-called “<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> financial
       crisis.” You state in your message that the position of the USA “is in
       no way directed against the Soviet Union.” It is difficult for us to agree with
       this, since facts speak otherwise. Complications in this question are provoked by American
       diplomacy.</p>
                        <p>Our position is clear: we stand for strengthening the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in
       accordance with its Charter, for giving the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General
       Assembly the possibility of working normally, and for not burdening Soviet-American relations
       with the artificially created question of a “<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
       financial crisis.” There are far more important tasks, both in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and outside it, on the solution of which efforts should be
       concentrated in the interests of developing international cooperation and strengthening
       peace.</p>
                        <p>We received with satisfaction your statements—in the message to Congress
       “on the State of the Union” and in your personal message—in
       favor of the development of relations between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
       the USA. The Soviet Government is an advocate of having relations between our countries
       expand and improve, including in the field of trade and scientific and cultural exchanges,
       and we are ready to work together in this direction.</p>
                        <p>We share your view on the desirability of a personal meeting which would permit the conduct
       of a direct and constructive exchange of views on questions of interest. We value the
       attention you have shown <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0260"/>and it would give us great
       pleasure to receive you in the Soviet Union on a State visit, which would actually be a

       accorded you.</p>

       said he had been instructed to make the following oral reply:</p>
                        <p>“The Soviet Government considers it necessary to state that it cannot recognize
       as well-founded the attempts to justify the bombing by American aircraft on February seventh
       and eighth of the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. It expressed its appraisal
       of these actions and necessary warnings in the February ninth statement of which the United
       States Government is aware.<note n="3" xml:id="d91fn3">For text, see <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>,
        February 9, 1965, p. 12.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>“If one takes seriously the repeated statement of the United States Government
       to the effect that it is striving for a strengthening of peace, for an improvement in
       American-Soviet relations, then the motives for the actions undertaken by the USA do not lend
       themselves to rational explanation.</p>
                        <p>“References were contained in the February seventh White House statement<note n="4" xml:id="d91fn4">For text, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, February 22, 1965, pp.
        238–239.</note> that these bombings were undertaken in connection with the fact that some
       sort of plans for actions against American military <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0262"/>installations were being hatched by Hanoi. However, to use this type of argument for armed
       actions in international affairs would mean only an attempt to assume for oneself the right,
       at one's own discretion, to resort to arbitrary acts which, even expressing it
       mildly, it is impossible to characterize other than as provocative. It is clear that there
       can be no justification for such actions which do not conform to elementary norms of
       international laws.</p>
                        <p>“We are told such thoughts were also conveyed from you personally, Mr.
       President-that the American bombings were undertaken in reply to an attack by guerrilla
       forces on a camp near the South Vietnamese town of Pleiku, where many American military
       personnel are located. Consequently, if such an attack took place, it was undertaken on the
       territory of South Viet-Nam. But can this be a basis for an armed attack on another state?
       After all, if we are guided by such logic, then it is possible to justify any aggressive
       actions, to subject any country to bombing. If, for example, affairs are going badly for the

                        <p>“We should like to say directly that it is impossible to solve the problem of
       South Viet-Nam by such a course. And the Soviet Government would like to hope that greater
       realism will prevail in the policy of the United States. If the matter stands differently, if
       in the future also the policy of the United States is made without regard to reality, then it
       could lead to unfortunate results.</p>
                        <p>“In a conversation with our Ambassador on February seventh, the question of
       visits was raised.</p>
                        <p>“When you, Mr. President, raised in your recent message to Congress the question
       of exchanging visits between the leading figures of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
       and USA, we were inclined to regard this as evidence of the intention of the Government of
       the USA to seek ways to improve Soviet-American relations. Now there has been brought to our
       attention your words to the effect that the recent developments do not signify changes in
       your policy, that you are not seeking and do not wish a widening of the conflict. We were
       informed that in advancing the proposal for the exchange of visits you proceeded and are
       proceeding from really serious intentions. We are taking these communications into
       account.</p>

                        <p>“Unfortunately, there exists an obvious contradiction between the statements of
       the American side regarding the desirability of meetings for the purpose of seeking
       possibilities for improving relations and actions like those being undertaken in Viet-Nam;
       and the Soviet Government in all frankness calls this to your attention.</p>
                        <p>“We should like to hope that an end would be put to the actions which were

       would be to the advantage of all and would contribute to the establishment of peace in

        the Embassy was “attacked this afternoon by a mob of at least 1500
        persons” including some Soviet students but mainly Asians, despite assurances
        earlier in the day from the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs that protection would be

        Vietnam. (Telegram 2308 from Moscow; ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> I wished most strongly to protest fact
       of demonstration and extensive resultant damage to Embassy premises because of inadequacy of
       police protection. I indicated that the demonstration obviously had been staged with
       foreknowledge of Soviet authorities since <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0264"/>public
       announcement of demonstration had been posted on Moscow University bulletin board this
       morning and it was because Embassy had been informed of this that we had requested Ministry
       for adequate protection and informed Ministry that Embassy would hold Soviet authorities
       responsible for any damages incurred. Demonstration had resulted in breakage of about 200
       windows, serious defacing of Embassy facade and bombardment of hundreds of
       missiles—some of such type as to be of danger to life and limb. I had with me
       samples of such missiles including iron bolts, steel pellets and rocks which I left with
        <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName>. I also told <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> that a French correspondent had been seriously injured in demonstration
       (Ullmann of AFP)<note n="3" xml:id="d92fn3"> Bernard Ullmann, Chief of the Moscow Bureau of
        Agence France Presse.</note> and an American correspondent turned up missing (Clymer,
       Baltimore Sun). I told <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> that I expected Sov Govt
       to compensate Embassy for damages incurred and to make arrangements for immediate repairs to
       Embassy premises in order to permit carrying out of normal Embassy functions. I also asked
       him to ascertain whereabouts of missing American correspondent and inform Embassy soonest of
       results Ministry's inquiry.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> pointed out that the demonstration was direct
       reflection of strong feelings held by Soviet people and foreign students resident in Moscow
       toward aggressive action by American forces against <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, an
       independent state and friend of Soviet Union. In <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName>'s view there was more justification for protest of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> actions in Vietnam by those genuinely interested in preservation
       of peace and normal international relations than for protest against demonstration by people
       genuinely and deeply disturbed by recent events. With regard my remarks concerning damage to
       Embassy premises <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> said that Soviet administrative
       authorities at request of Ministry had taken ample measures for protection of Embassy
       including significant reinforcement of militia. He regretted damage to Embassy but insisted
       that Soviet authorities had made maximum effort to guard against such damage. With regard my
       remarks re correspondents <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> failed understand why
       I should make representations with regard to a French national but he undertook to ascertain
       whereabouts of missing American correspondent and inform Embassy of results of inquiry.
       Meanwhile, he was happy to learn that no Embassy personnel had been injured in demonstration
       and promised to take immediate measures to ensure adequate repairs to Embassy property. In
       fact, <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> said UPDK had already been given the
       necessary instructions and he was sure that they would actively and completely cooperate with
       Embassy to effect immediate repairs. My additional requests (presumably referring to request
       for compensation) he said would be promptly examined by appropriate authorities.</p>
                        <pb n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0265"/>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> I saw no need to debate with him
       question as to who was real aggressor in Vietnam since I was sure he was familiar with
       statements issued by White House, Stevenson letter, and statement to Dobrynin.<note n="4" xml:id="d92fn4">For text of Stevenson's letter, February 7, see Department of
        State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, February 22, 1965, pp. 240–241; for the statement to Dobrynin on the same

       then said it was perfectly clear from damage caused Embassy that protection accorded by
       Soviet authorities had been grossly inadequate; while it was true that the militia had been
       reinforced, no efforts had been made to keep demonstrators away from Embassy and to prevent
       them from damaging property as well as hurling—in some cases by
       sling—deadly missiles capable of causing serious injury, into Embassy offices and
       living quarters. In connection his remarks re French correspondent, I told Zorin that
       certainly Ullmann had right to be in vicinity American Embassy, that Embassy personnel had
       interceded in order to rescue him from crowd and had given emergency medical care to
       obviously seriously injured man; I felt that in this case Ullmann's condition was
       more important consideration than his nationality. In stressing seriousness with which we
       regard such demonstrations, I reminded Zorin of statement made by Secretary after November
        incident<note n="5" xml:id="d92fn5">See <ref target="#d75fn1">footnote 1, Document
        75</ref>.</note> and also remarks by President in State of Union message with regard to need
       for respect and protection of American property and personnel abroad, handing him a
       typewritten excerpt of this passage.<note n="6" xml:id="d92fn6">For text, see Public Papers

       installations against damage and demonstrators and in fact our regulations preclude
       demonstrators from approaching diplomatic missions closer than 500 feet. I felt compelled to
       seek assurances from Ministry that similar adequate measures would be adopted in Moscow and,
       failing such assurances, I would have to recommend a reexamination of our own procedures.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> said he also did not wish to enter into detailed
       discussion of question of guilt in Vietnam and in this respect would rest on assessment of
       situation set forth in Soviet Govt statement published in Pravda today. He insisted that
       protective measures had been adequate and he could assure me that Soviet administrative
       authorities would continue to apply necessary measures in order protect Embassy property
       since Soviet Govt considers this solemn obligation. While he would, of course, report my
       remarks to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, he wished stress need for removal
       causes for international misunderstanding and he urged <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in
       particular to bear this in mind. We should recognize that actions incompatible with
       preservation of peace and normal international <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0266"/>relations are bound to give rise to such incidents and demonstration. He felt first task
       both our governments was to seek avoid cause for such unpleasantness. He hoped US Govt would
       correctly interpret Soviet Govt's statement published today as well as additional
       remarks which <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> will be making in Washington on
       subject.</p>
                        <p>I again took issue with <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName>'s
       insistence that protective measures had been adequate, stressing that damage to Embassy and
       behavior of crowd which imperiled life and limb Embassy personnel belied <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName>'s assertions. With regard to his remarks on
       causes on misunderstanding I could agree that it should be mutual responsibility of our two
       governments to work toward their removal and I hoped that at this very moment <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was using his influence to prevent the kind of
       aggression that led to the incident today.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> said he could not agree with my assessment of
       situation and wished point out simply that it was <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> planes
       and <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> personnel and not Soviet planes and personnel that had
       attacked Vietnamese. He felt we should understand that continued actions of this sort could
       not but lead to serious consequences.<note n="7" xml:id="d92fn7">On February 11 the Embassy
        in Moscow again protested the attack on February 9. On this occasion Smirnovsky stated that

                        <p>2324. While I continue to believe that Sovs are anxious to avoid escalation of hostilities
       in Vietnam and this morning's joint statement on the Hanoi visit supports this
       view, I think we must recognize that if Viet Cong attacks and our retaliatory moves multiply,
       pressures on Sovs to “put up or shut up” mount accordingly. I would
       think it likely that the Sovs themselves are now seriously examining possible countermeasures
        <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0267"/>which in their view would promise some prospect of
       compelling us to temper our reaction to Vietnam developments without running real risk of
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet confrontation. Obviously one of principal reasons
       for such soul searching exercise on part of Sovs must be recognition that in context their
       obvious interest in demonstrating their reliability as socialist ally in face of goading
       commentary by ChiComs, they must at some point be prepared to do more than make statements,
       attack this already battered Embassy and offer defensive military equipment to North
       Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, I would call attention to development reported Embtel 2320,<note n="2" xml:id="d93fn2">Dated February 10. (Ibid., POL 17–2 <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>)</note> when Embassy officers who planned visit Kiev, Minsk
       and Lvov on book buying trip were told trip could not be registered for temporary reasons. We
       have asked British Embassy to make application for similar trip to ascertain if temporary ban
       applies to them as well. If it does, we should consider the possibility that Sovs are trying
       to give us the impression that they may be up to some military move in Eastern Europe (e.g. a
       move against access to West Berlin backed by troop reinforcements) responsive to increased
       tension in Southeast Asia and in Soviet-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> relations.
       Alternatively, they may be starting some military moves which they wish to conceal at this
       juncture. Our military attachés inform me that this is not the normal time for
       winter maneuvers and if troop movements are reason for temporary closing of normally open
       areas, then they must be of an extraordinary nature.</p>
                        <p>If Sovs are in fact thinking on these lines they may be making a bad miscalculation. The
       effect may well be just the opposite of what they hope. On other hand, Sovs may be intrigued
       with possibilities inherent somewhat less than enthusiastic support of our policy in
       Southeast Asia by majority Western European countries and may think that by presenting them
       with possible choice between facing nasty flareup in Central Europe and exerting pressure on
       us to temper actions in Vietnam, they have real opportunity of causing serious intra-alliance
       friction.</p>
                        <p>Other possible pressure points are, of course, Laos and Korea. In latter connection the
       announcement this morning of <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s trip
       to Pyong Yang bears close inspection. While we assume for the moment that the principal
       reason for <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s change in plans is
       related to the March 1 meeting (and could even be reaction to ChiCom pressure on North
       Koreans to move South in a diversionary effort), we cannot exclude the possibility of Sovs
       themselves being intrigued with Korean theater as a vulnerable pressure point. Moves in Laos,
       of course, would be easier logistically and might be regarded as safer from Sov point of view
       and perhaps more difficult from <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> point of view.</p>
                        <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0268"/>
                        <p>As I indicated at outset, I still think Sovs are anxious to avoid any dangerous increase in
       tension and do not want to be alarmist. However, Sovs do face a real problem in present
       circumstances and probably feel selves under increasing pressure not to appear weak and
       ineffective. Their assessment of what they can do with minimal risk and how this may affect
       Western public opinion is obviously a very tricky exercise. We should be considering what we
       might do to influence their thinking in a healthy direction.<note n="3" xml:id="d93fn3">On

                        </p>
                        <p>Once in Hanoi, however, Sovs became a victim of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> plot
       and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was genuinely on spot. I tend to believe
       that Vietnamese them-selves and not Chinese were primarily instigators of action against
       installations in South Vietnam since while Chinese may reap benefits in long run from
       episode, at moment Sovs have gained considerable tactical advantage in their struggle for
       Communist leadership. Vietnamese undoubtedly felt reasonably sure that their militant action
       could not but work their advantage whether US reacted or not since in either case pressure
       would have been on <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. In one case, <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would have been proved “paper tiger,” in
       the other case, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> would be faced with a
       “fish or cut bait” situation. Latter is in fact what happened and
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was probably forced expand original Sov
       military commitment to <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, Sov commitment, while perhaps qualitatively the same as before, was forged in
       fire of conflict and carried with it a psychological entanglement which may in end force the
       Sovs to face up to fatal retreat or risk of confrontation with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. In other words, the Sovs may well be heading for sort of dilemma always
       inherent in duality of Sov policy which they have assiduously sought to avoid i.e.
       ideological considerations which require militancy and national interests which require
       avoidance of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet confrontation. Sovs have thus embarked
       on perilous path and are being propelled by ChiCom pressure and imperatives of developing
       situation itself perhaps faster and more recklessly than they themselves wish or their own
       security considerations would dictate. Joint statements following Hanoi and Pyong Yang
       meetings do not in themselves seriously extend Sov commitment in area but they do provide
       basis for increased pressure on Sovs to act in event deterioration of situation. Thus there
       is real danger in development situation and we can only hope that along with deeper
       commitment Sovs have managed to acquire some means of control over future <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and North Korean (possibly even ChiCom) behavior.</p>
                        <p>2) That Sovs are aware of this danger seems reasonably clear from restraint of their
       message contrasted with militancy of the ChiCom message exchanged on occasion 15th
       anniversary Sov-Chinese defense treaty (similar contrast marks Sov Feb 9 and ChiCom Feb 13
       declarations) as well as from current exercise in which they engaged in effort to assign full
       blame to US for deterioration <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations. Most <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0270"/>dramatic evidence of latter was warning to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> contained Sov Govt Feb 9 statement which was elaborated
       subsequently in Korionov's Pravda article reported Embtel 3236.<note n="5" xml:id="d94fn5">Dated February 13. (Ibid., PPV 7 <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>)</note> This could be simply propaganda ploy in context
       current Soviet efforts demonstrate militancy to eastern brethren. It could, on other hand be
       reflection of official Sov assessment and against this possibility we should correct
       potentially serious miscalculation.</p>
                        <p>3) I have been giving serious thought to what we might do or say in order to provide clear
       signal to Sovs that course on which they now embarked is fraught with danger and that they
       should be under no delusion that bee is on them rather than us if there is to be improvement
       bilateral <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Sov relations. I would not think much could be
       done of a salutary nature before March 1; Sovs maneuverability obviously strait jacketed by
       requirements on them to do nothing which could be interpreted as weakness until March 1
       meeting and immediate aftermath safely out of way. For this reason I would think any direct
       high-level action would be wasted until Sovs are out of their current ideological bind. At
       some later point, however, we must make clear to Sovs that any serious defeat of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> foreign policy objectives in any part of the world would render
       impossible any substantial improvement in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet bilateral
       relations; we recognize this as an imperative for Sovs and they must equally recognize this
       as a condition for our own policy maneuverability.</p>
                        <p>4) I do think, however, that even prior to March 1 we should set record straight on the
       price tag which the Sovs are publicly placing on improvement our bilateral relations. This
       could probably best be done in upcoming speech by major American spokesman. This is important
       even if exercise I have referred to above is simply propaganda ploy; it is vital, of course,
       if Sovs are in fact victims of own propaganda and are being seriously deluded. Major points
       should in our view be:</p>
                        <p>A) That <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> interest in continuing forward progress in
       bilateral relations recorded during past couple of years has been vigorously reaffirmed by
       Pres Johnson since election and beginning of new administration;</p>
                        <p>B) This program, however, has been based on cooperative effort and can only continue on
       such basis; at present it is Soviet side (not United States) which has taken initiatives
       which have caused deterioration; and</p>
                        <p>C) While we have genuine interest in improvement bilateral relations this cannot be at
       expense of principle or basic interests.</p>

                        <p>I took the occasion of the Soviet Ambassador's visit to tell him I thought he
       ought to know how strongly the President felt about the demonstration against our Embassy in
       Moscow, and particularly the failure of the police to furnish adequate protection. I said we
       were also concerned here about the involvement of an American correspondent. I said I
       certainly hoped they did not intend to pursue the bringing of charges against him.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he understood that the correspondent had
       hit a policeman. He said possibly the correspondent had become angry, but this was a serious
       matter. I said that I understood there was a scuffle, but our information was not that he had
       deliberately hit the policeman and, in any event, I thought that the best thing would be for
       this to not go any further.<note n="2" xml:id="d95fn2">During this conversation <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> also explained further U.S. policy on Vietnam stating

         Soviet Government had made several gestures toward the improvement of relations, not that
         they felt President Johnson needed them, but they were genuine. He emphasized that contrary
         to press statements, the Soviet Government was not in a position of having any need to
         improve relations, although they thought that this was in the mutual interest of both
         countries. He said it was not a question of desiring to worsen them, but was simply one of
         fact that if our present policy continued, our relations would be adversely affected. I
         said I could recognize this fact but it seemed to me they were attempting to use the threat
         of worsening relations as a deliberate move to affect the Vietnamese situation. I pointed
         out that after the Cuban affair we had been able quickly to resume our progress in
         bettering our relations.”</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>In the four months since the fall of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> the
       effects which this event might have on the general course of Soviet foreign policy, and in
       particular on relations with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, have been far from clear.
       There have been some signs of a willingness to continue the phase of reduced tensions which
       began in the wake of the Cuban missile crisis and which brought some constructive
       developments in Soviet-American relations. But there have been other signs-in Soviet handling
       of the Congo and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> crises, in the virtual standstill on
       bilateral issues, and in the generally more militant and at times even hostile tone of
       propaganda-of an inclination to terminate the post-Cuba phase and to return to a harder
       stance in relations with the West.</p>
                        <p>The intensification of the Vietnam crisis over the last week, preceded as it was by Soviet
       moves to resume an active role in that area, has brought what is apparently the first major
       test of the succession leadership's conduct of external policy. This paper
       examines some of the questions posed by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s involvement in the Vietnam crisis, primarily with a view to
       inferences which may be drawn about the general direction of Soviet policy in the current
       phase.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Why Soviet Policy Resumed an Active Role in Southeast Asia</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had virtually disengaged Soviet policy from
       the Indochina problem, presumably because since mid-1963 Hanoi's alignment with
       Peking had been complete and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> no longer had any real
       influence on the conduct of the warfare in South Vietnam and Laos. Deeply preoccupied with
       internal economic problems, he was probably not willing to see a new increase of tensions in
       relations with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> develop from the sharpening
       confrontation in Vietnam which Hanoi and Peking insisted upon. He was moving in any case
       toward a rupture with the Peking-led parties in the Communist movement. His <pb n="245" xml:id="pg_245" facs="0273"/>course manifested itself in tacit abandonment of
       Moscow's co-chairmanship responsibility under the Geneva agreements and in his
       tepid reaction to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> retaliatory attacks in the Tonkin
       Gulf incident last August.</p>
                        <p>It now appears that the <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> leadership rejected this virtual ceding of Chinese
       hegemony over the Communist movement in Asia. Contacts with Hanoi were resumed in November,
       and new declarations of Soviet support “in the struggle against <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> imperialism” were then issued in the following weeks.
       Evidently the Soviet leadership was encouraged by these soundings and by a change of tone in
       Hanoi's utterances on the Sino-Soviet quarrel to believe that there was a chance
       of bringing North Vietnam back to something like the middle position it had held earlier in
       the struggle between Moscow and Peking. This possibility would be increased if Moscow could
       be helpful to Hanoi in what must have looked like the approach of the terminal phase of the
       war in South Vietnam. To play such a role would also deprive Peking of exclusive credit for
       having backed this crucial “national liberation struggle.” This would
       offset the Chinese charges of Soviet lukewarmness toward such efforts, long one of the key
       issues in the dispute.</p>
                        <p>It was almost certainly this chance to win back the support or at least the neutrality of
       one of Peking's client parties, all the more important because of the reluctance
       of East European and other parties to proceed toward a showdown with Peking and its
       supporters, which drew Moscow into its courting of Hanoi. At the time the <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> visit was laid on with a view to capping this effort,
       it was probably believed in Moscow that there was little chance that a “wider
       war” would develop over South Vietnam and so involve the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in a risky commitment. Or it may have been thought that Moscow's
       renewed support to Hanoi would help to deter the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and so
       minimize this risk.</p>
                        <p>It cannot be excluded, of course, that Moscow did estimate that there was still
       considerable danger of escalation of the Vietnam war but chose deliberately to run the risk
       of injecting itself into the situation. In case of success, the prospective gains in the
       intra-Communist quarrel and in terms of prestige throughout the Afro-Asian world would be
       tempting. It is mainly Moscow's consistent record of caution in direct
       confrontations with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> which discredits this
       hypothesis.</p>
                        <p>Even if the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> accepted defeat in South Vietnam without
       moving to enlarge the war, however, it must have been recognized in Moscow that the Soviet
       move to associate itself with Hanoi at the last stage could bring a sharp deterioration in
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations. It may have been hoped that this could
       be overcome by a campaign of new gestures for relaxation of tensions culminating in an
       exchange of high-level visits. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had
       similarly attempted to combine a Western reverse over Berlin with the healing effects of
       summitry.</p>
                        <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246" facs="0274"/>
                        <p>If the foregoing reconstruction is reasonably accurate, it is clear that the Soviet
       leadership was willing, for the sake of possible gain in its struggle with Peking for
       leadership in the Communist movement and the Afro-Asian world, to put its relations with the
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in serious jeopardy. This shift in priorities conforms
       with the impression that many observers have had of Moscow's behavior in recent
       months: that the primary preoccupation of the new leaders, apart from internal problems, was
       in coping with the challenge of China rather than in continuing the improvement of relations
       with the West.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Possible Consequences of Soviet Support for North Vietnam</p>
                        <p>The problem posed for the Soviet leaders by the sudden threat of escalation in Vietnam is
       probably felt as an agonizing one: If the “wider war” develops after
       all, what risks of serious confrontation with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> should
       they assume to fulfill their new commitment to Hanoi? To appear to renege would be extremely
       costly in the struggle with Peking. On the other hand, the Soviets must see one particularly
       dangerous feature in this crisis; they will not be in full charge, but can have their hand
       forced by Hanoi and perhaps also by Peking. It is probably this that explains the still
       somewhat hazy formulation of the pledge to Hanoi, unchanged even after <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s visit and the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> attacks.</p>
                        <p>Whenever Soviet freedom of maneuver is narrowed in a major crisis, the hypothesis is
       advanced-and deserves examination-that Moscow might try to force the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to back off by bringing pressure to bear in another theater. In the present
       case, a new threat to Berlin access, a push against South Korea, or in Laos are all
       conceivable.</p>
                        <p>The device of instigating a diversionary crisis to maximize pressures has never been
       employed by the Soviets in the past, although they had this option in both the Berlin and
       Cuban cases. The compelling reason against it has probably been that to present the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> with what would then appear as a generalized threat rather than a
       limited local demand might raise tensions beyond control. At a minimum, it would greatly
       complicate the tasks of crisis management. It could also overextend <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> conventional capabilities and so increase the incentive to resort to nuclear
       weapons. In the present case, with some degree of escalation already taking place, and with
       the Soviets not in complete control of their partners, resort to a diversionary crisis seems
       even less likely than in previous cases.</p>
                        <p>Almost certainly the course which the Soviets prefer would be to combine a strong display
       of support for Hanoi with diplomatic action to contain the crisis. The critical unknowns
       affecting this possibility are the intensity of Hanoi's desire for early victory
       even in the face of major dangers and the degree of Moscow's leverage on the North
       Vietnamese leadership.</p>

                        <p>It is possible that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> argued successfully that
       if Hanoi was patient some while longer and refrained from raising the level of action in the
       South to a point which would provoke further American attacks, the process of decay in Saigon
       would eventually bring victory through negotiations. He might have pledged that Moscow would
       take a line in such negotiations that would ensure that control of South Vietnam would not in
       the end still elude Hanoi. Promises of substantial military and economic aid might have made
       such an offer more persuasive.</p>
                        <p>The declaration terminating the <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> visit is not
       clear as to what further line of tactics might have been agreed, or even whether there was
       actually agreement on this at all. It would not be surprising, however, if the Soviets now
       pressed hard for negotiations, perhaps privately to avoid any inference that Hanoi was cowed
       by the threat of further <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> attacks.</p>
                        <p>At this juncture, it appears that the Soviet move into the Vietnam problem can hardly fail
       to worsen <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations. To avert this, either the
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would have to accept a defeat gracefully and without
       rancor, or the Soviets would have to curb their support for Hanoi once again.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Implications for Sino-Soviet Relations</p>
                        <p>It has been suggested that one consequence of intensified crisis over Vietnam could be a
       healing of the Sino-Soviet rift, and that Moscow might be willing to take greater risks of
       confrontation with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> because of this possibility. Already
       declarations of Bloc solidarity in the face of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aggression
       have issued from both sides and the anniversary observances of the Sino-Soviet defense treaty
       have solemnly reaffirmed its continued validity.</p>
                        <p>Against the background of the whole prolonged quarrel with Peking and the issues that have
       been at stake in it, it must be seriously doubted that any hope of reconciliation figures in
       Moscow's calculations at this time. The courtship of Hanoi was undertaken
       precisely in order to undercut Chinese influence there, and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s appeals during his travels for unity in the international
       movement have found no resounding echo in Peking. One purpose of his stops there may have
       been to persuade those parties which were reluctant to come to the March 1 meeting in Moscow
       that new bilateral approaches by the Soviets would be futile.</p>
                        <p>Both sides, of course, have an interest in playing down polemics when situations of crisis
       arise, and in this case both wish to show solidarity with Hanoi. To do otherwise would appear
       unseemly in the eyes of brother parties for whose loyalties the Chinese and Soviets are
       contending. But the central issue between them remains. That issue is <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248" facs="0276"/>authority-who has power to promulgate the general line and to
       command on tactical decisions. The conflicts arising from this issue have in effect become
       non-negotiable between the two Communist great powers. In a situation of crisis with the
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> this issue is more likely to be sharpened than it is to be
       attenuated.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Prospects for Soviet-American Détente</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s moves over the last several months
       to involve itself once again in the Vietnam problem with support for Hanoi obviously
       endangers the détente which has been assumed to exist in Soviet-American
       relations. It had been frayed already by the Congo problem, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> crisis, Soviet reaction to <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, and the
       sometimes quite violent propaganda accompanying these developments.</p>
                        <p>There is always a tendency to hope that a period of reduced tension accompanied by some
       constructive agreements, even if these are only marginal and symbolic, will build on itself
       and lead on to more substantial accords. This tendency arises from the nature of the
       West's aims in the cold war and expresses its view of the value of continuing
       détente.</p>
                        <p>Until now, the Soviet view has been different. Historically, the function of
       détente for the Soviets has been to provide a period of pause in offensive action
       whenever the relation of forces turned unfavorable. The aim is a temporary truce and there is
       no Soviet assumption that this can or should be built into a solid peace.</p>
                        <p>After the offensive over Berlin miscarried and ended in the humiliating setback of the
       Cuban missile crisis, the Soviets clearly felt the need for a period of diminished risk in
       which they could deal with internal economic troubles, correct the imbalance in military
       power, and repair the damage to their prestige and political influence. It would obviously be
       incorrect to say that they have accomplished all this, and it would be an oversimplification
       to conclude that they have now deliberately entered on a new “hard
       line” phase which terminates the détente begun in 1963.</p>
                        <p>In some respects, however, the Soviet leaders probably do feel that their relative power
       position has improved since 1963. They have increased their influence in the underdeveloped
       world, and can now command wider support there on at least a certain range of issues. The
       troubles in the Western alliance have deepened and there is particular doubt about European
       support for <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy in Asia. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s successors may feel that they have begun to get a grip
       on their economic problems, and that their military programs are moving forward with
       diminished strain on the economy. It is true that the deep divisions within the Communist
       movement continue, but these are in part the result of détente and might be
       ameliorated by withdrawal from it.</p>
                        <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0277"/>
                        <p>Altogether it appears likely that the combination of such factors has led the Soviet
       leadership, if not to terminate détente abruptly and deliberately, at least to
       place a lesser priority on its continuance. In recent months they have been willing to make a
       number of tactical choices at the expense of the détente: Their effort to compete
       with China has brought a new note of militancy to their propaganda. They have refused any
       compromise on the Article 19 issue. They intervened by proxy on the side of the Congo
       rebellion in order to stimulate and profit from radical nationalism in Africa. And they have
       now undertaken to renew support for Hanoi's “liberation
       struggle” in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>“Peaceful coexistence is the form of struggle appropriate to the present
       epoch,” a policy to expand Communist power without major war. It always combines
       elements of hostility and reassurance, advance and withdrawal, as tactical advantage
       indicates. Currently the Soviet leaders may be changing the mix. The outcome of the Vietnam
       crisis will obviously now have a major influence on whether the détente phase
       begun in 1963 proves to have run its course.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>I talked with Tommy about the pen pal series-the importance of the channel and the apparent
       Soviet sensitivity about the way it is being handled.</p>
                        <p> Tommy clearly has reservations about the exercise under present Soviet management. He
       feels it has become too much of an impersonal Soviet Government enterprise. It is focusing on
       issues better serviced by regular diplomatic communications and without personal Presidential
        <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0278"/>involvement. He also is miffed by the fact that
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> breached the rules of conduct for handling
       the series.</p>
                        <p>In response to my suggestion that a reply be drafted so that the President, the Secretary
       and you could see what it would look like-mentioning such subjects as those you raised
       earlier, the exchange of visits, disarmament, Vietnam-Tommy said (1) the Foster-Fisher
       disarmament proposals were non-starters and given the present state of affairs in Vietnam
       made almost no sense; (2) the Secretary had handled Vietnam with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> yesterday afternoon<note n="2" xml:id="d97fn2">A memorandum of their
        conversation is in the National Archives and Records Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Conference Files: Lot 67 D 586, CF 86.</note> and he, Tommy, wanted to see
       what that produced before taking the exercise further; and</p>
                        <p>(3) the Soviets seemed to be persisting in wanting to discuss Berlin and the mutual
       withdrawal of forces from Europe, both non-starters from our side at this time.</p>
                        <p>After I repeated for the nth time the importance which I was sure you attached to keeping
       this channel open and working, particularly in the present context, Tommy agreed to put
       something together, but after he saw the substance of the Secretary's exchange
       with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I will follow through again.<note n="3" xml:id="d97fn3">On March 16 <persName corresp="#p_KD1">Klein</persName> forwarded to <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName>
        summaries of the pen pal exchanges with the “<persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> regime” and
        suggested the subject matter for a reply in his 4-page covering memorandum. (Johnson
        Library, National Security File, Intelligence File, Pen Pal Material) The next day he sent
         <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> another 4-page memorandum on the
        “Pen Pal Exchange” that summarized communications with the Soviets on
        several issues since January. (Ibid.) In a June 21 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName>, noting that he was “forever looking for means to reestablish
        the pen pal exchange-which in my view has tremendous psychological as well as political
        importance in our relations with the Soviets, particularly during times of
        crisis,” <persName corresp="#p_KD1">Klein</persName> proposed a pen pal message
        on the President's forthcoming (June 25) address to the United Nations. (Ibid.,
        Head of State Correspondence, Pen Pal Correspondence, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>)</note> In the interim I think it might be useful for you to raise this
       general subject with the Secretary. A go-ahead signal from him will get Tommy moving with
       less resistance. As far as the subject matter is concerned, part of the input, particularly
       on disarmament, will have to come from this end of town because there is little sympathy for
       it on the 7th floor at State.</p>

        and asking the Soviet Government to provide the full protection required by international

       for future to protect Embassy and staff against criminal acts by rioters armed with lethal

                        <p>I emphasized again that I was asking for and expected protection for Embassy and personnel,
       that we had informed Ministry of impending demonstration, and that past gives sufficient

                        <p>2586. Embassy was again attacked this afternoon by mob in excess of 3000 persons mostly
       Asians in what developed into most aggressive and nastiest demonstration here in recent
       memory. Damage assessment not yet complete but probably 150 to 200 windows broken on all
       floors except ninth and tenth, and many ink splotches defacing building. No injuries to
       American personnel although one officer on tenth floor struck in face by flying but spent
       steel ball bearing.</p>
                        <p>In apparent response to our representations earlier today, protective measures were much
       more in evidence than in previous demonstration. About 100 yard long line of snow plow trucks
       were parked bumper to bumper down center of Chaikovskiy Street in front of building about
       thirty minutes before mob arrived. About 300 militiamen also on hand before crowd arrived.
       Perhaps 70 mounted militia also on hand.</p>
                        <p> Mob arrived at 1540 from Krasnaya Presnenskaya metro station north of Embassy where had
       gathered about half hour earlier. Within minutes several hundred had broken through
       earlier-erected barrier of trucks and portable steel fencing erected by militia approximately
       30 meters in front Embassy gates. Most of missile damage done at close range by those who
       broke through lines.</p>
                        <p> Militia made serious effort to hold back majority of crowd. We estimate many demonstrators
       were at least slightly injured as they crushed through and over line of parked trucks. Many
       individual battles observed between demonstrators and police. Crowd eventually appeared
       nearly out of effective control at which time, about 1600, some 300 ground forces troops,
       under command general officer, moved in from north of building. These troops, plus action of
       mounted militia appeared to turn tide and take most of enthusiasm out of very hostile
       crowd.</p>
                        <p>At least ten militiamen and several horses were injured, some apparently seriously, and
       many demonstrators were hauled off in Soviet paddy wagons.</p>
                        <p>Bulk of demonstrators moved south of building about 1610 where permitted to regroup. Stood
       there in formation nearly one hour, chanting <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0281"/>slogans
       and waving banners, with militia and military troops standing by. At 1710, this nucleus,
       perhaps 1000 strong, moved back in front of building and troops immediately moved out between
       mob and building.</p>
                        <p>Press corps judiciously was not in front of building although they had heard of impending
       event earlier in day. One correspondent reports that damage from ink and sling-shot propelled
       missiles more extensive than demonstration February 9.</p>
                        <p>At 1800 crowd still in front of Embassy but under control of military and militia units.

       agree with last two paragraphs. All of us here feel deeply that we must, as you suggest, keep
       “channels of communication open during fluid and critical period.”</p>
                        <p>With regard to your suggestions, there are no forthcoming public appearances by Soviet
       Embassy staff except one of which sponsors are left-wing groups which would be unlikely to
       cancel. We shall, however, attempt to ensure that exchange program sponsors point out to
       their Soviet contacts on appropriate occasions that attacks on Embassy can damage exchange
       program and U.S.-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations. However, our position has
       been somewhat weakened by recent attack on Soviet Embassy here.</p>
                        <p>In general, we consider it important to avoid getting into a visa war with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. We are glad for that reason that you merely postponed the
       Soviet group rather than refusing visas outright. Serious as these attacks are, they are less
       important than such substantive issues as S.E. Asia, disarmament and European security, on
       which progress requires free U.S.-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> interchange.
       Therefore, we must strive in our own interests to keep a dialogue going even in the face of
       Soviet actions against U.S. policy in third areas or unpleasant incidents like the attack on
       the Embassy.</p>

                        <p>Tonight Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName> and I dined alone and
       informally with Soviet Ambassador and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>,
       finally accepting an invitation that had been scheduled and cancelled several times during
       the last few months.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had a question to put which he repeated
       several times: “How much importance does the United States give to its relations
       with the Soviet Union? Do you consider relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to be of high priority? Of highest priority?”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> professed puzzlement by U.S. air strikes
       against North Vietnam. He reviewed briefly <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations during the Johnson Administration. When President
       Johnson assumed the Presidency his policy toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
       was unknown. Gradually the Soviet Union had come to respect him as a supporter of the Test
       Ban Treaty, of non-proliferation of weapons and the voluntary cutback in the production of
       fissionable materials. The Ambassador said the Soviet people had developed a sympathy for the
       President, partly because the Soviet press had given broad coverage to the
       President's positive steps for peace.</p>
                        <p>But, said <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, why did the United States bomb
       Hanoi while our new Premier was there? Before his visit we were not committed to heavy
       support of North Vietnam: but we were now. We thought the President was a man concerned about
       relations with the Soviet Union-that he had put them at the top of his list. When the
       President defeated <persName corresp="#p_GB1">Goldwater</persName> we looked forward to
       better relations. But we can't understand why you are testing us now. We are in a
       quandary. Don't you think your relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> are of high priority? If you do, then why do you bomb North Vietnam? Why do
       you test us?</p>
                        <p>Or, asked the Ambassador, is it because you base your policy on Soviet-Chinese differences
       and you don't think we'll aid Hanoi? If so, you're wrong.
       Why do you do this? Our relations, continued <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>,
        <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0286"/>seemed to have improved. What's gone
       wrong? The President had said he might come to Russia and he wanted our leaders to come
       here.</p>
                        <p>I try to cable the truth to Moscow, including things the Foreign Office doesn't
       like. I say the good things when I think they're good. I try to tell the truth.
       But why are you testing us now? Don't you understand as a Socialist State we are
       morally and ideologically bound to come to the assistance of a sister Socialist State? We
       can't be a leader and stand by and ignore the bombing of the North Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>Is it because your policy is based on Soviet-Sino differences, he asked. These differences
       are real. But you are pushing us together. You will force us to admit there can't
       be peaceful co-existence. If you continue to bomb and aggress against North Vietnam, we lose
       the argument. You're forcing us to agree with the Chinese who say to us,
       “Look at that brutal bombing! And you speak of peaceful
       co-existence?”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> here returned to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations. We don't want to
       admit we're wrong, he said. But I can't understand why you bombed when
       Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was there. I can't
       understand what your government was thinking of. Do you care about your relations with the
       Soviet Union? The fact that you bombed while our new Premier was present leads us to the
       opinion that you don't care, or is it because you're trying to confront
       us? Can you imagine the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> bombing another country being
       visited by President Johnson? If we wanted to confront you, then perhaps. But for any other
       reason? <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> is a new Premier; do you seek to
       embarrass him?</p>
                        <p>At this point I said, you know the President used every means at his disposal to prevent
       embarrassment to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. He ordered <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Military to take no provocative actions and to use all influence
       possible to dissuade South Vietnamese counterparts from taking any actions that might
       embarrass your Premier. We were of the opinion that it was Peking and Hanoi who sought to
       embarrass not only Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> but also
       President Johnson. They tried to embarrass us both.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that surely the United States did not
       think the Soviet Union so stupid as not to have understood what was going on in Hanoi. But if
       your government had only said to us, “There's been an attack on our men
       and material at Pleiku and Camp Holloway. We know <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> is in Hanoi. We feel we must retaliate. But out of respect for <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, we won't do it when he is
       there.” What did the United States have to lose?, he asked. North Vietnam had no
       air force; the United States could strike North Vietnam at any time against little
       opposition.</p>
                        <p>We understood what they were doing, the Ambassador continued. Why didn't you
       credit our intelligence? Up until that incident on February 7, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was not committed to North Vietnam. He was new and his government was
       new. There are always uncertainties with new <pb n="259" xml:id="pg_259" facs="0287"/>governments. And then your action caused great concern back in Moscow. When the Soviet
       people read that 150 bombers took off in Saigon and bombed North Vietnam they remembered that
       only 5 or 10 Luftwaffe bombers wiped out or burned whole villages. When they heard bout 150
       American bombers, what were they to think? The people asked what's happened? What
       were we doing to make the Americans stop?</p>
                        <p>Then <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that the Soviet Union had
       understood the vital interests of the United States. The Soviet Union respected them. It
       respected the power of the United States. But by bombing North Vietnam the United States
       might force a confrontation that could grow more serious and painful every day.</p>
                        <p>Then I replied. I drew from my pocket the statement of the President on August 10,
        1964.<note n="2" xml:id="d103fn2">For text, see Public Papers of the Presidents of the
        United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>, 1963–1964, Book II,
        pp. 946–947.</note> I read that statement carefully to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. I made it clear that President Johnson's
       policy and Congress' policy were one. The policy of the United States was
       published to the world and understood by the entire world. Surely it was understood by the
       Soviet Union before the trip by Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
       to Hanoi and to Pyongyang. I said we considered relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to be very important. Every decision the President makes is made in the light
       of these relations. The Soviet Union knows we have a commitment to defend South Vietnam. We
       intend to keep that commitment.</p>
                        <p>President Johnson refrained for a long time, I continued, from responding to attacks upon
       Americans in South Vietnam. There had been an attack upon Americans during Christmas.
       President Johnson refrained from responding to that attack for two reasons: he did not want
       to accelerate the struggle; he hoped it was only an isolated incident and not a broad
       pattern.</p>
                        <p>Then I cited the White Paper which indicated the seriousness of the infiltration of men and
       arms across the border into South Vietnam.<note n="3" xml:id="d103fn3">See <ref target="#d100fn5">footnote 5, Document 100</ref>.</note> (<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> did not then, or later, seek to deny Hanoi's command and
       direction of the war.)</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> agreed for the moment to assume the
       correctness of the facts of the White Paper. But even if there are 30,000 North Vietnamese
       infiltrators, that number is still only about the same as your 24,000 U.S. soldiers. Further,
       it's obvious you've put much more military material into South Vietnam
       than has Hanoi, he said. But the war continues. Therefore, there would be a civil war whether
       North Vietnam were engaged <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0288"/>or not. The Vietnamese do
       not want the regimes of Saigon. It is the view of the Soviet Union that South Vietnam, if
       left free to make a choice, would become Communist, sooner or later.</p>
                        <p>For a considerable period of time, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said,
       the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had not been disinterested in an international
       conference. It had not closed the door on United Kingdom or French initiatives.
       “But we're not interested anymore,” he said.</p>
                        <p>I said we had reliable information that Hanoi boasted it was going to win anyhow and saw no
       reason to go to a conference. I considered that talk a threat to peace.</p>
                        <p>I said I wanted to direct his attention again to what President Johnson has said. We had no
       great desire to have our boys killed anywhere in the world, but the North Vietnamese must
       leave South Vietnam alone. If what you say is true, it is a civil war that is going to end in
       a victory for Communism anyhow—what do you risk by insisting that North Vietnam
       cease and desist its infiltration of men and supplies into South Vietnam? Why does not the
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, acting in its capacity as Co-Chairman of the
       Conference that set up the general guarantees, take some initiatives, exercise its
       leadership, and persuade North Vietnam to stop? What have you got to lose? You say your
       sister state is going to win anyway, what can you lose? Use your influence, and you have
       influence, and demand that Hanoi stop its command, direction, and above all, infiltration. If
       infiltrations stop, and it can be verified, then there is something accomplished. At least
       there would be a step toward conditions for a peaceful settlement.</p>
                        <p>You know, responded <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, you can't
       police a jungle border.</p>
                        <p>I know you can't be absolutely sure every rifle has stopped coming across, I
       partially agreed, but if you really put the pressure on Hanoi, it would stop.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said the United States could not expect that
       while its bombings were going on.</p>
                        <p>I said that North Vietnam should be willing to respect its agreements. The first Geneva
       Accord was now eleven years old. We are not going to stop our bombing while North Vietnam
       continues to ignore its agreements. If North Vietnam gave any indication by positive action,
       particularly by cessation of its flow of subversives and arms into South Vietnam, we then
       might have the beginning of possibilities for diplomacy. If we could see twenty-years ahead
       we would hope that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
       were working together more closely. The most dangerous threat today was not between the
       world's largest powers but from skirmishes between smaller states which might back
       powerful Allies into a corner. The situation today was somewhat like 1914.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that we were much more mature now. We
       had learned a lot. He didn't think we would let 1914 happen again.</p>
                        <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261" facs="0289"/>
                        <p>There were some differences now between 1914 and 1965 I agreed, but small powers seemed to
       get larger Allies into interesting positions.</p>
                        <p>Why don't you stop injuring, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
       asked, the vital interests of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>? Surely the United States understood that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> knew there were certain things it must never do when it came
       down to the vital interests of the U.S. And surely the U.S. knew the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could not back away from a Socialist country. If it did, the whole Communist
       camp would say the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was weak-that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> put United States interests above those of the Socialist
       system.</p>
                        <p>I then pressed him hard. He must understand the United States is a major power. It was
       sensitive about being attacked by others. Our people would accuse us of having no courage if
       we didn't respond to illegal and outrageous attacks upon American soldiers and
       airmen. What else could the Soviet Union expect us to do after this long line of bloody
       incidents? You recognize we are in South Vietnam. We are committed to its defense. South
       Vietnam is being attacked by North Vietnam. The Viet Cong are agitators, terrorists,
       subversives, infiltrated, directed and commanded by Hanoi. They might not have crossed the
       border in a formation of ten divisions in the old fashioned way, but they have crossed and
       they have aggressed. Perhaps the United States still had something to learn about what you
       call wars of national liberation, but we are learning. We will win the war in Vietnam. We all
       know there have been certain instabilities in South Vietnam, but the margin of the difference
       between its stability and instability is the infiltration by North Vietnam. That infiltration
       must cease.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he knew the U.S. was a major power.
       “Why don't you believe we know you're strong,” he
       said. “We know what you can do. We know you could probably destroy us. You have
       massive strength. Whatever you do, you do as a very strong state.”</p>
                        <p>I said that he might say that. But Hanoi seems to see nothing of the sort. They call upon
       us to get up and to go home. We are not going to get up and go anywhere as long as Hanoi
       continues its aggression against South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he knew the United States did not want
       to negotiate. Right now the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> did not want an
       international conference. That was the declared position. But there were other ways, he
       mused. During the Cuban confrontation, his house had been used for various things, not for
       negotiations, but for things that have been instrumental in getting a settlement. There were
       many other ways.</p>
                        <p>I asked him to assume that North Vietnam and the United States were locked together; tied
       down on a track from which they could not get loose. According to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, this situation had led to trouble. Now shouldn't the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> exercise some initiative in this situation? Wasn't
       the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> concerned about its relation with the United
       States? If our <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0290"/>relations were of the highest
       priority, should not the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> use its strong position in the
       Communist camp and persuade the North Vietnamese to cease and desist forthwith?</p>

       said was on the instructions of his Government.</p>
                        <p>“I informed Moscow about our conversation on March second, Mr. Secretary.<note n="2" xml:id="d104fn2">A copy of the memorandum of <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s March 2 conversation with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, primarily on Vietnam and Laos, is in National Archives and Records
        Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1964–66, DEF 1–1 ASIA
        SE. The portion of the memorandum on Laos is printed in <ref target="frus1964-68v28#d170">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964–1968, vol. XXVIII, Document 170</ref>. The
        two also briefly discussed resumption of the Geneva Disarmament Conference and East-West
        trade.</note> Now I have been instructed to convey to you some considerations in connection
       with your statements, made during that conversation.</p>
                        <p>“1. Careful study was given in Moscow to what you said on a number of questions
       concerning international affairs and our bilateral relations as if in continuation of the
       talks held last December between you and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the U.S.S.R.</p>
                        <p>“To your statement that the Government of the United States continues to be
       interested in the improvement of relations with the Soviet Union, we can give a plain
       answer:</p>
                        <pb n="263" xml:id="pg_263" facs="0291"/>
                        <p>“The Soviet Government, as it has already declared, stands consistently for the
       development and improvement of relations with the United States of America. And we agree when
       you, Mr. Secretary, say that, as the U.S. Government believes, our countries must pay a
       constant attention to every possibility of improving the understanding between them and to
       the search for ways of settling outstanding problems. And it was with this view, in
       particular, that we held the exchange of opinion with the American representatives during the
       December talks, mentioned by you, Mr. Secretary. In the same spirit we, as is known, had also
       an exchange of views later, including exchanges through other channels.</p>
                        <p>“It would hardly be right, however, to pretend that since the time of the
       December meetings nothing has happened in the world and that the international situation as
       well as the atmosphere of the Soviet-American relations have not undergone any changes. It
       would mean to depart from the reality and to close eyes to the actual state of affairs. One
       cannot but admit that the international tensions have again increased in the recent months
       and that a certain damage has been caused to the relations between our countries.</p>
                        <p>“First of all, we have in mind, of course, the actions of the U.S. against the
       Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam, our attitude toward which was given in the statements of the
       Soviet Government of February 9 and March 4.<note n="3" xml:id="d104fn3">For text of the two
        statements, see <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>, February 9, p. 12, and <hi rend="italic">Current Digest of the Soviet Press</hi>, March 24, 1965, p. 17.</note> Such
       actions by the U.S., and we deemed it necessary to say it also publicly, are incompatible
       with the statements about an intention to improve relations with the Soviet Union. It is hard
       to imagine that the leaders of the U.S. foreign policy would not have realized this and would
       not have taken into account that the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam is a socialist country
       to whose fate the Soviet Union cannot and will not remain indifferent. How then should we
       view the American bombings of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> territory? In any event
       these aggressive actions of the U.S.—and they cannot be defined
       otherwise—cannot serve as an example of a ‘constant attention toward
       all possibilities of improving the understanding between us.’</p>
                        <p>“The Soviet Government has warned the U.S. Government that the Soviet Union
       together with its allies and friends will take measures to protect the security and to
       strengthen the defense capability of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam. There should be no
       misunderstanding on this point: all necessary measures are already being taken and will be
       taken for defending the brotherly socialist country.</p>
                        <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0292"/>
                        <p>“It should be said straightforwardly: the armed provocations by the U.S. against
       the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam are undermining the very foundation on which the
       relations between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. can only be based, namely-the principle of
       peaceful coexistence. One may not accept this terminology, one may use other words-but what
       is important is strict observance of this principle in international affairs and, especially,
       by the great powers. In our times, no less than before, it is true that 'the world
       is indivisible' and that creation of a hotbed of tension in one point of the globe
       inevitably entails new dangers, new deterioration of the whole international situation. It
       would be also a mistake to proceed from an assumption that it is possible to apply different
       standards to one's own actions and the actions of other powers and to believe that
       one may do what the other may not.</p>
                        <p>“2. In our conversation, Mr. Secretary, you said a great deal about the
       situation in Southeast Asia. The U.S. Government believes, as one can understand your words,
       that the interests of the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. do not collide in that region and that
       therefore our countries should both apply their efforts to finding mutually acceptable
       solutions to the problems of that area. First of all, it should be noted that the first point
       would be correct provided neither of the sides interfered into the affairs of the countries
       of Southeast Asia. We find it necessary to state quite definitely that open military
       interference of the U.S. in South Viet-Nam, the American bombings of the Democratic Republic
       of Viet-Nam affect the interests of all socialist states and all peace-loving peoples.</p>
                        <p>“We, of course, absolutely do not agree with your evaluation, Mr. Secretary, of
       the situation in South Viet-Nam and of the reasons that have created the present situation.
       In the talks last December you, Mr. Secretary, were informed in detail about our view with
       regard to the developments in South Viet-Nam and it was shown that the assertions about the
       so-called “aggression from the North” against South Viet-Nam were
       without foundation. Precisely the U.S. policy which in the past wrecked the Geneva agreements
       that provided for a unification of Viet-Nam on the basis of free elections, gave start to the
       deterioration of the situation in Viet-Nam. It was emphasized that the U.S. does not have any
       rights to dictate to the Vietnamese people as to how they should decide their domestic
       problems. We warned at that time that by trying with the help of bombs to solve this problem,
       the U.S. was taking a very dangerous path and that the American actions in South Viet-Nam
       were in contradiction with the statements of the U.S. Government about the desire to
       contribute to the lessening of tensions in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>“The recent events show that the U.S. has taken the course of escalating the war
       in Indo-China. The increasing armed intervention of <pb n="265" xml:id="pg_265" facs="0293"/>the United States in South Viet-Nam, the landing there of combat units of the U.S. Marines,
       the sending of new American military units and armaments to that region, the concentration of
       U.S. Navy forces off shores of Viet-Nam—all these are acts of overt aggression
       creating a threat to peace and security of the peoples. Having taken the course of bombings
       of the territory of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> the U.S. has crossed all the
       limits in its aggressive acts and actually started military actions against an independent
       and sovereign state.</p>
                        <p>“If the United States assumes that by its provocative aggressive actions in
       Viet-Nam it will be able to intimidate anybody, it is a gross miscalculation. Calculations of
       this sort are without any real ground. By such kind of actions, by direct and gross violation
       of the Geneva Agreements on Indo-China and of most elementary norms of international law it
       is impossible to find ‘a mutually acceptable solution of the problem of this
       region’ of which you, Mr. Secretary, spoke. It is the course aimed not at finding
       a settlement, but at a dangerous widening of the military conflict, a course fraught with
       most serious consequences for the entire international situation. The U.S. Government is
       assuming a very grave responsibility for all the consequences of such a course.</p>
                        <p>“When you, Mr. Secretary, say that we should, perhaps, discuss respective
       evaluations of the situation in Viet-Nam, at least, for the purpose of clarifying this
       question and when you state that the U.S. is prepared to do this, one can answer as follows:
       if the U.S. Government really desires to look for ways for a peaceful settlement, then it is
       necessary to strictly carry out the Geneva Agreements and, first of all, cease the aggressive
       acts against the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>“The U.S. Government knows how we view the situation in Laos. We have repeatedly
       drawn the attention of American representatives to the fact that the aggravation of the
       situation in that country is caused by continuous interference of the U.S.A. into her
       internal affairs which recently has taken an absolutely inadmissible form of American
       bombings of various points on the territory controlled by the Pathet Lao forces. Is it not a
       most rude violation of the 1962 Geneva Agreements on Laos?</p>
                        <p>“Whether Souvanna Phouma can come to an agreement with Souphanouvong is an
       internal matter of Laos. We hold the view—and we have repeatedly stated it to the
       U.S. representatives—that an agreement between Laotian factions would have become
       possible had it not been hampered by American interference into the affairs of Laos. You, Mr.
       Secretary, suggest that in the efforts to settle the problem of Laos the starting point
       should be the signing of the 1962 Geneva Agreements and not the situation which had developed
       in that country before the Agreements, since otherwise, as you said, there would be little
       hope <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0294"/>for success. In reality, however, the actions
       of the U.S. are leading to the pre-Geneva situation if not to an even worse situation. At the
       same time the United States rejects proposals on the necessity to convene an international
       conference on Laos. The question arises what is the true position of the U.S.A.?</p>
                        <p>“We believe that if the Geneva Agreements on Laos are to be considered, as you
       suggest, ‘a symbol of a possibility to achieve not only a bilateral agreement
       between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A. but of broader agreements,’ then it is
       necessary first of all to strictly observe the Geneva Agreements.</p>
                        <p>“As to giving recommendations by the co-Chairmen to the participants of the
       Geneva conference, in accordance with Article 19 of the Protocol, concerning further
       activities of the International Control Commission, this question is under study now.
       However, one cannot but see that the development of events in Laos hampers making of a
       decision.</p>
                        <p>“3. You put forth considerations why the American Government thinks it useful to
       resume the work of the Committee of 18 on disarmament.</p>
                        <p>“As is known, the questions of disarmament were rather thoroughly discussed
       during the exchange of opinion between the Soviet Union and the United States in New York and
       Washington last December. On December 7, 1964, the Soviet Government submitted for the
       consideration by the 19th session of the U.S. General Assembly specific proposals on the
       measures for further relaxation of international tensions and limitation of the armaments
        race.<note n="4" xml:id="d104fn4">See <ref target="#d78fn4">footnote 4, Document
        78</ref>.</note> The U.S. representatives said that these proposals would be thoroughly
       studied. So far, however, we have not received any reply from the Government of the United
       States. Due to the well-known circumstances, the responsibility for which rests not with the
       Soviet Union, the problem of disarmament has not been discussed at the 19th session of the
       U.N. General Assembly either.</p>
                        <p>“We consider negotiations on the problem of disarmament to be important and
       necessary. However, speaking about the work of the Committee on disarmament, it is necessary
       to recognize that it has not produced any tangible results. Besides, it can be said that
       tensions that recently increased in connection with the United States' acts in
       Southeast Asia create the atmosphere which by no means facilitates negotiations on
       disarmament. One cannot ignore in this connection also the plans for creating the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nuclear forces in any of their variations-in the form of
       'multilateral force' or ‘Atlantic Force.’ Such
       plans are <pb n="267" xml:id="pg_267" facs="0295"/>absolutely incompatible with the need to
       solve the disarmament problem and, in particular, of the problem of preventing further
       proliferation of nuclear weapons. If these plans were realized this would inevitably cause a
       new intensification of the armaments race.</p>
                        <p>“4. There are also other important international issues which are on the agenda
       and which must be solved. Among such problems is first of all the problem of European
       security and German peace settlement.</p>
                        <p>“It should be pointed out that your statements on the questions which you raised
       do not contain any constructive proposals.</p>
                        <p>“As to us, our proposals, in particular on such questions as the German problem,
       disarmament and Laos, are well known to the American side. The position of the Soviet
       Government in connection with events in Viet-Nam are also well known to the Government of the
       United States. We can only repeat that first of all it is necessary to stop aggressive acts
       against the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam, to withdraw the U.S. Armed Forces from South
       Viet-Nam and to strictly observe the Geneva Agreements.</p>
                        <p>“We shall not conceal that we are under impression that in Washington they
       apparently underestimate all the seriousness of the situation which is developing in this
       connection, all the burden of responsibility which the United States is assuming for its
       aggressive actions in Indo-China.”</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he would wish to study his statement carefully and would be in
       touch with him later about it, but would make certain preliminary comments. He said that with
       respect to Laos, the sole object of our policy and attitude was complete compliance with the
       1962 Accords. He wondered how we could make progress unless there was a common understanding
       of facts. We knew that at no time after the signature of the 1962 Accords did the North
       Viet-Namese strength decline below six thousand men and that they have continued sending men
       and arms into Laos contrary to the Geneva Agreement. The present situation was that the
       Soviet Government supported the Geneva Accords and this was important. We did the same. The
       problem was now how to get to the result that that Accord was implemented for. To be frank,
       since the <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> talks in 1961,<note n="5" xml:id="d104fn5">For records of <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s conversations with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, June 3 and 4, 1961, see <ref target="frus1961-63v05#d83">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1961–1963, vol. V, Documents 83</ref>-<ref target="frus1961-63v05#d85">85</ref> and <ref target="frus1961-63v05#d87">87</ref>-<ref target="frus1961-63v05#d89">89</ref>.</note> and the conclusion of the 1962 Agreements we
       felt that the Soviet Union was acting in good faith. When major violations of those
       Agreements occurred, we did not attempt to hold the Soviet Union wholly responsible since we
       realized that they did not control the Pathet <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0296"/>Lao or
       the Viet-Namese. Nevertheless, violations did exist. The problem was how could we and other
       signatories bring Laos back to compliance. The Secretary referred to the events in 1964, when
       the Pathet Lao moved in the Plaines Des Jarres to destroy the position of the neutralist
       forces there. Then there was the difficulty of the position of Souvanna as Prime Minister,
       which the Pathet Lao treated with contempt. In addition, there was the continued paralysis of
       the International Control Commission, which was unable to find out the simplest facts about
       the situation. He wished to suggest that the question facing us in Laos was how to make the
       1962 Accords effective. We were prepared to do everything possible to bring the situation
       back to compliance with the Geneva Agreements. He doubted, however, that Hanoi was
       interested. The Secretary concluded his remarks on this subject by saying that he would give
       further study to the remarks which <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had
       made.</p>
                        <p>With regard to Viet-Nam, the Secretary said we should distinguish between two different
       aspects of the matter. If the Soviet Union felt it has a commitment to support the security
       of a socialist state, then we have no quarrel on that issue. We have no desire to destroy any
       socialist state and, on the contrary, we would use our own influence against the use of force
       to interfere with socialist countries. In Southeast Asia, however, we have a different
       problem. North Viet-Nam is attacking its neighbors, sending military men and arms into Laos
       and into South Viet-Nam. For the Soviet Union to say it is going to support socialist
       countries in such activities does bring us into a situation in which we have a real issue. We
       have said to all capitals concerned that peace can be restored almost overnight if North
       Viet-Nam stops its activities directed against South Viet-Nam. We do not ask the Soviet Union
       publicly to confirm the facts as we know them to be, but we do ask them to believe us when we
       say that North Viet-Namese men and arms are being sent regularly to Laos and South Viet-Nam.
       Yesterday the Secretary had seen reports of prisoners identifying their North Viet-Namese
       units. We knew that there was a North Viet-Namese divisional headquarters in South
       Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we recognize the fact that the Soviet Union had some problems within the
       Communist world that make for complications in settling these matters, but they should be
       settled. We were not asking North Viet-Nam to surrender, but only to stop shooting.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> broke in to ask if they were shooting at us.
       The Secretary replied that they were. He went on to say that we saw no suggestion that the
       North Viet-Namese were interested in stopping the conflict. He said that if the North
       Viet-Namese forces had moved as divisions across the border, the whole problem would have
       been quite clear, but clandestine infiltration did not change the matter. We did not <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0297"/>believe that the problem of the divided countries such
       as Korea, Germany, and Viet-Nam should be changed by force. We did not know what capabilities
       the Soviet Union had to get Hanoi to settle the South Viet-Nam problem promptly. We had hoped
       that the Soviet and British co-Chairmen could have ascertained the views of the parties so
       that the co-Chairmen and others could have examined these views to see whether there were
       possibilities to solve the problem. We were disappointed that the Soviet Union decided it
       could not act in that capacity. It was hard to believe that there was any basic conflict of
       interest between the United States and the Soviet Union in Southeast Asia. At least we hoped
       that it was the case. The ability of these states to live at peace with each other was all we
       asked as we had no specific United States interest in this area.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we hoped it would be possible to solve this question without undue
       delay, but he had to add that we have undertaken direct, simple, and clear commitments to
       South Viet-Nam and we would meet these commitments. He only hoped that the necessity for
       meeting them could be avoided by prompt restoration of peace in the area.</p>
                        <p>With regard to disarmament, the Secretary said we attached real importance to the
       continuation of the discussions in Geneva. Each side had made a number of proposals to the
       other. There had been a little progress and he cited the Test Ban Treaty and some steps taken
       by mutual example. He thought we should not be discouraged because we have not accepted the
       Soviet proposals nor they ours. Each side was disappointed by the response of the other, but
       the efforts should be continued. In this respect, we had an obligation to our own peoples and
       to the rest of the world. He pointed out that conditions had not been good when Mr. McCloy
       and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> had made progress in 1961. There had
       also been tension while the Test Ban Treaty was being considered. He hoped both Governments
       would continue to work on the subject of disarmament.</p>
                        <p>On the German question, the Secretary said he did not have much to add at the present
       moment. He had raised with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> the possibility of
       informal discussions at the Ambassadorial level but <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had not been receptive to Four-Power talks on this issue.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> pointed out that the Soviet Government had
       also made a proposal for discussions.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary concluded the interview by saying that he would later give the Ambassador a
       more systematic reply to his statement.</p>

                        <p>2920. Vietnam and Soviet-American Relations.</p>
                        <p>I. When new Soviet leadership decided, several months ago, that conduct their conflict with
       ChiComs required reversal <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> line and
       reversion to active role in Southeast Asia, they must have realized this could entail
       deterioration their relationship with U.S. They apparently hoped damage could be limited both
       in scope and in duration, and assumed normal relationship could then be restored.</p>
                        <p>After <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> in Hanoi found <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> and company confident with respect outcome South
       Vietnam and negative with respect negotiations, Soviet dilemma sharpened. It has since been
       aggravated by mounting American support of South Vietnam, on one side, and continuing ChiCom
       attacks on Soviets, on other. In circumstances, they have now clearly decided imperatives
       their commitment and influence in Communist world at this stage are incompatible with and
       predominate over interest in continued development relations with U.S.</p>
                        <p>II. More precise import this decision is now emerging, both in word and in deed. As regards
       deeds, it now seems clear that there will be no new initiatives on Soviet side or acceptance
       of initiatives from American side (with possible exception a few non-political matters of
       tangible interest or value to Soviets). Presently arranged exchanges will be allowed to
       continue but will not be extended or added to. Not only will direct negotiations at least be
       played down, if not avoided, but same will apply to international forums where U.S. and
       U.S.S.R. are main protagonists.</p>
                        <p>Following are principal matters in which this decision has played major role to date:</p>
                        <p>1. Bilaterals.</p>
                        <p>A. Rejection of national war college visit and postponement of U.S. visit of Sov military
       officers.</p>
                        <p>B. Inaction on leased line request.</p>
                        <p>C. Refusal of requested extensions to U.S. exchange students.</p>
                        <p>D. Stalling on other bilaterals such as exchange of meteorological data. (Exception for
       King Crab discussions and fishing inspections which Sovs must regard as of commercial
       advantage.)</p>
                        <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0299"/>
                        <p>2. Negative decision on resumption of <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. Color TV deal with French.</p>
                        <p>Unless and until situation changes, this line of action (or inaction) will continue to be
       followed, with negative implications for resumption progress in bilateral field, and further
       aggravation already negative attitudes with respect such international problems as
       disarmament, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> finance and peace-keeping, and Germany.</p>
                        <p>III. As regards words, all stops are now being pulled out in major political and propaganda
       campaign designed to justify course adopted by Soviet leadership in eyes own people and to
       undermine U.S. position throughout world. This has gone through several stages:</p>
                        <p>1. Initial reaction to airstrikes against North Vietnam, while shrilly reflecting official
       anger at coincidence with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> visit, was
       relatively controlled. Main feature this phase, demonstrations Feb 9 and March 4 against
       Embassy, boomeranged so violently they could only add to embarrassment and frustration
       leadership (and hopefully, may finally have persuaded them this not useful instrument of
       diplomacy).</p>
                        <p>2. After fiasco March 4 demonstration, campaign of more peaceful protest meetings launched
       in factories, institutes, universities, trade unions and other organizations throughout
       country and similar activities promoted abroad. These have produced shower of petitions to
       Embassy, telegrams to White House, and continuing flow of material “branding
       shameful aggression American imperialists” which now constitute substantial
       portion reading matter offered Soviet people in daily press.</p>
                        <p>3. World-wide interest in Voskhod II was exploited to initiate sharper phase of campaign,
       with <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> on March 24 branding
       “American aggressors” as barbarians and bandits who should not think
       “time will wash off disgrace [of] their crimes.” Polemical style of
       professional party propagandists was apparent in subsequent note delivered to and returned by
       this Embassy March 26 stating as fact “confirmed by official U.S.
       spokesmen” that “poison gases are being used in South Vietnam by the
       U.S. armed forces with approval U.S. State and Defense Depts” and charging that
       “Today United States has passed over from experiments to combat employment these
       inhuman weapons” which even “Hitler and his generals did not dare to
       put into use.”<note n="2" xml:id="d105fn2">Regarding the use of riot-control gas
        by U.S. forces in Vietnam, see <ref target="frus1964-68v02#d210">

       anti-U.S. and anti-<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> themes being developed for 20th

                        <p>4. Top officials from government ministries were instructed not attend social functions
       U.S. Embassy February and March but lower ranks were allowed to come and no effort made cut
       off scientists, journalists, artists and other “intellectuals.” In
       encounters at various ceremonies elsewhere, leaders and high officials have been personally
       cordial but have seemed almost studiously avoid substantive talk, particularly about
       Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>IV. Current period seems likely be much more protracted and harder [to] live through
       without serious damage than Cuba crisis, especially in view relative weakness and sense of
       frustration of present Soviet leadership. However, some salutary forces are at work and may
       help so:</p>
                        <p>1. A knowledgeable Soviet source has told us that while “tough”
       sections top leadership want complete stoppage Soviet-American activities, including
       exchanges, “you have some influential friends who do not allow this to
       happen.” This seems confirmed by continuing friendly attitude members Soviet
       elite, who while apprehensive about possible escalation and confrontation, seem anxious
       continue contacts and keep things going forward.</p>
                        <p>2. As nearly as we can judge, people generally are apathetic and skeptical. Somewhat
       disturbed by sense of increased war danger and by “poison gas” charges
       but with basically curious and friendly attitudes toward United States unchanged. Embassy
       travelers have been in north, in central Asia and in south during past two weeks visiting
       many institutions where “protest meetings” had been staged by party
       agitators. Reception invariably friendly, practically no mention Vietnam, some expressions
       regret damage to Embassy and hostility toward Chinese.</p>
                        <p>V. I see little we can do which would bring about substantial change current Soviet policy
       in short run. However, I consider essential for longer run to maintain posture on Vietnam
       reflected in President's statement of March 25<note n="3" xml:id="d105fn3">For
        text, see Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>, 1965, Book I, p. 319.</note> and to demonstrate in word and
       deed we desire continue course of sound improvement Soviet-American relations of recent
       years. Indeed, while I recognize deteriorated atmosphere presents problems, I hope we will
       push forward such pending matters as ratification of consular convention, East-West trade
       legislation, and provision suitable premises for new Soviet Embassy, all of <pb n="273" xml:id="pg_273" facs="0301"/>which are in our net interest, and encourage private interests
       similarly carry on as normally as possible, for example by participation in upcoming Soviet
       film festival and chemistry exhibition. In word, I think we should persistently reiterate
       themes that (a) U.S. policy of helping in past ten years; (b) U.S. policy of improved
       understanding with Soviet Union continues; and (c) if there is deterioration relations this
       result of changes in Soviet, not American policy. Soviet controlled media will not publish
       American side of story, but this becomes known here through <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> and other foreign media and local grapevine and will have salutary effect.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>After six months of consolidation and transition, the new Soviet leaders remain committed
       to the broad policies and goals established by the three party congresses of the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> era. However, they have introduced a new style of
       leadership which emphasizes a careful approach to basic economic problems and a greater
       regard for expert judgment, in contrast to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s penchant for panaceas and quick solutions which often
       proved to be unworkable. The new agricultural plan revealed by <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> in late March testifies to the collective leadership's
       ability to make bold and far-reaching decisions on fundamental policy questions. It not only
       represents a thoughtful, concerted attack on the problem of agricultural productivity but
       also acknowledges that the necessary resources to solve this problem can be found only by
       cutting back on budgetary allocations to other claimants.</p>
                        <p>In contrast to this generally successful performance in domestic affairs, the new
       leadership's first major departure from <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0302"/>course in
       foreign and international Communist affairs has miscarried. Developments in the Vietnam
       conflict over the past two months have led to a deterioration in Soviet relations with the
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, a potentially dangerous involvement in Indochina, and an
       aggressive Chinese reaction which has again thrown the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
       on the defensive in the struggle with Peiping.</p>

                            </hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The most immediate question facing the new leaders last October was what attitude to adopt
       toward <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. Their decision to forgo a
       full-scale denigration campaign and to stand on the official explanation that he was relieved
       of his duties because of his advanced age and the deterioration of his health-was probably
       influenced by a variety of reasons.</p>
                        <p>The new leaders undoubtedly recognized that direct attack would be hailed by the Chinese
       Communists as confirming their indictments of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s “revisionism.” They probably also
       saw that detailed charges against <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would
       tend to commit them to a wholesale repudiation of his policies and predetermine their future
       lines of movement. It seems unlikely, moreover, that any move toward sustained public
       denigration would have encountered strong opposition within the leadership and jeopardized
       the collective facade at the very outset. Finally, the Soviets were probably aware that a
       “de-Khrushchevization campaign” would sharply aggravate the delicate
       relations with the Eastern European governments and foreign parties, whose initial criticisms
       of handling of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s dismissal
       raised a clear danger signal.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Collective Rule</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As in the initial period following Stalin's death, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s successors have rediscovered the “sacred and
       immutable” Leninist principle of collective leadership and have vowed to prevent
       the emergence of a new “personality cult.” In contrast to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s demagoguery and flamboyance, they have
       made a studied effort to appear businesslike and dignified. In informing the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Embassy, for example, that the traditional New Year's
       Eve party in the Kremlin would not be held, Soviet officials implied that this spectacle was
       considered too Khrushchevian.</p>
                        <p>Collectively, particularly in the early stages, was carefully observed in protocol matters,
       with greetings to foreign leaders signed by <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>,
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>. In day-to-day matters, party leader <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> and Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> seemed
       rarely to intrude into each other's sphere. Both government and party were
       represented in missions abroad and in consultations with foreign visitors in Moscow. Care <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0303"/>was taken that no single leader monopolized public
       attention. Personal publicity in the press was carefully balanced.</p>
                        <p>This partial and probably temporary closing of ranks, however, does not mean that
       maneuvering for advantage, competition, and policy differences were not under way within the
       leadership. There have, in fact, been some indications that the period of relative political
       truce is coming to an end. But the unprecedented overthrow of a Soviet leader by his
       erstwhile protegés and lieutenants with the stated purpose of restoring
       “Leninist norms” of collective leadership appears thus far to have
       imposed a substantial barrier against the emergence of the kind of earnest struggle for power
       that marked the early post-Stalin period.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Division of Responsibilities</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The process of defining the relative power and positions of the ruling group is still very
       much in flux. <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> is showing signs of emerging as
       “first among equals” and his position as party first secretary affords
       him a powerful advantage. But Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> seems to
       rank not far behind in the external symbols of authority. Although <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName>'s status has recently become ambiguous, his
       public actions, at least in the first four months, suggested that he was acting as the senior
       party secretary immediately below <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>. Publicity
       accorded <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>, as titular chief of state, is
       intended to place him in this inner circle, but the record so far gives the impression that
       neither he nor <persName corresp="#p_SMA1">Suslov</persName> is in the first rank.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">The Top Three</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the first months following the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> coup,
        <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> seemed to be playing a cautious hand. He
       avoided firm commitments to any controversial positions and his speeches revealed little
       except a desire to avoid giving offense to any of the various competing power
       hierarchies.</p>
                        <p>At last month's central committee meeting, however, <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>-by acting as spokesman for the bold new agricultural program-created
       the strongest impression of personal leadership since the fall of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. Although the new program was undoubtedly worked out through the
       efforts of a large number of leading officials, including several members of the party
       presidium, it will be identified with <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> and he
       will reap the political benefits of whatever success and popularity the program achieves.</p>
                        <p>The fact that <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> has been willing to gamble
       his political career on a program so heavily dependent on touchy shifts in resource
       allocations suggests his mandate is a strong one and that he is confident of his ability to
       surmount any opposition from the military or heavy industry forces.</p>
                        <pb n="276" xml:id="pg_276" facs="0304"/>
                        <p>Unlike <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> has assumed an unobtrusive style which is consistent with other
       indications that he is very much an “organization man.” He is
       apparently attempting to build a machine manned by a personal following and there are already
       signs of a <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> clique in the party presidium
       composed of some of its younger and more energetic members. <persName corresp="#p_SAN1">Shelepin</persName>, Demichev, and Kirilenko probably are included in this group. While
       there is no assurance that this alignment will persist indefinitely, it provides a power base
       which might enable <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> to establish a commanding
       position in the party apparatus over a period of a year or two.</p>
                        <p>There have been only a few signs of a similar power grouping around Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. His strength seems to lie primarily in the respect he
       commands as an able administrator with an unrivaled knowledge of planning and industrial
       problems. As such, he may well be the most indispensable member of the present leadership. He
       has emerged as the leading exponent of a “scientific” and businesslike
       conduct of affairs. His report to the Supreme Soviet session in December on the 1965 economic
       plan was free of the usual ideological incantations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> has manifested no tendency to emulate
       Malenkov's ill-fated attempt to aggrandize the governmental machinery at the
       expense of the prestige and authority of the party apparatus. Although <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> probably could command wide support within the
       managerial elite, his performance and power base to date seem to rule him out as a major
       contender in a contest for supreme power. Since he rose through the government and economic
       apparatus, not through the party, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> would appear
       to have little chance of competing successfully with <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName> for control of the
       crucial levers of party power.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName> represents the most uncertain quantity in the
       present power equation. He was generally considered to be <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s principal rival for the succession in <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s last years. In contrast to <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>, who holds no governmental office, <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName> has used his position as a member of the presidium of
       the Supreme Soviet to inject himself into foreign relations. In this capacity, he headed a
       widely publicized delegation to Turkey earlier this year.</p>
                        <p>There were numerous indications during the first months after <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s fall that <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName> was one of the major forces in the leadership. He joined <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> in consultations with foreign Communist delegations.
       The regime seemed to be trying to demonstrate a near equality of status by designating
        <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> to give the traditional anniversary speech
       on 6 November and <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName> to propose-in the main
       address at the central committee plenum on 16 November-the reunification of the party
       organizations for industry and agriculture. The detailed reporting in the Soviet press on
        <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName>'s activities in Turkey seemed
       strong evidence of his importance in the leadership.</p>
                        <p>
                            <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0305"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName>'s status, however, has taken on a
       degree of ambiguity since his return to Moscow in mid-January. For some unexplained reason,
       he did not give the television report on this trip until 6 February. Although he continued
       his role in consultations with foreign party leaders by accompanying <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> to Budapest at the end of February, he did not
       participate in the 19-party “consultative meeting” in Moscow in the
       first week of March.</p>
                        <p>The first tenuous evidence that <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> or other
       members of the leadership might be attempting to undermine <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName>'s position appeared in the newspaper Economic Gazette in
       late February. Two articles in one particular issue drew a rather startling contrast between
       the poor economic performances of the Ukrainian oblast of Kharkov, with which <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName> is most closely associated, and the excellent
       performance of the rival Dnepropetrovsk Oblast, which is <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s old bailiwick.</p>
                        <p>If <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName> has in fact become the target of the
       kind of oblique sniping that marks the early phases of a power struggle, one of his
       vulnerabilities may be the fact that he, probably more than any of the present leaders, was
       regarded as a confidant of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. It would be
       premature, however, to underrate <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName>'s
       prospects for survival in this kind of internecine warfare. He is an experienced and shrewd
       politician and undoubtedly has a sizable personal following in the central committee.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Other Signs of Strain</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There have been several indications that the question of personnel appointments is one of
       the very sensitive issues facing the new leaders. While some of the earlier changes suggested
       that <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> was beginning to get his own way in this
       field, later developments indicated a renewed effort to maintain a balance of forces.</p>
                        <p>No one has clearly emerged as the master of party personnel matters. Speculation that
        <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName>, whose specific responsibilities are still
       not certain, had taken over this potent position has proved so far to be unfounded. <persName corresp="#p_SMA1">Suslov</persName>, on one occasion, and <persName corresp="#p_SAN1">Shelepin</persName>, on another, represented the hierarchy at important personnel meetings
       at the provincial level, but <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName>
       have not been associated publicly with any aspect of cadres work. It seems likely that this
       responsibility has been diffused among the top leaders in some form of collective control and
       handled by horse trading and compromise.</p>
                        <p>This was brought home most markedly as a result of the shifts announced at the March
       central committee session. The only promotion to full membership in the presidium-that of
       Mazurov, the former Belorussian party boss-involved a man with a conspicuous lack of ties to
       any of the prominent contenders for power. In addition, Mazurov <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0306"/>also became <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s chief
       assistant as first deputy premier-a job for which he has absolutely no experience. In another
       part of this balancing act, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s
       former first deputy, Ustinov, was transferred from his home ground in the government to work
       in the party secretariat under <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>. It is unclear
       whether Ustinov's transfer indicates an effort to break the <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> orientation in the government or whether it reflects
       the policy of bringing expert opinion closer to policy-making levels.</p>
                        <p>The latest shifts also failed to clarify the situation in agricultural leadership where
       vacancies have existed for several months. The question of a replacement for party secretary
       Ilichev and the ideological and propaganda sphere was also bypassed.</p>
                        <p>Another possible sign of strain is the failure to appoint a successor to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> as chairman of the party bureau for the Russian
       Republic (<gloss target="#t_RSFSR1">RSFSR</gloss>). This post in the past has belonged to the
       party first secretary. It was created in the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> era and had become one of the symbols of his undisputed leadership.
       It is not clear whether <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> has not claimed this
       post out of deference to collectivity or whether he lacks the political strength to take it
       in the face of opposition. It is possible that some leaders favor abolishing the bureau
       entirely in order to remove this post from contention.</p>

       serious policy dilemma since the Cuban crisis of 1962. The calculations underlying an
       ambitious program to reassert Soviet leadership in the Communist world while maintaining a
       détente line toward the West were abruptly upset by the chain of events
       precipitated by the Viet Cong attack on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> installations in
       South Vietnam in early February and the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> air strikes against
       North Vietnam. The Soviet leaders now find themselves faced with a deterioration in relations
       with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, a potentially dangerous involvement in the
       Vietnam conflict, and an aggressive Chinese reaction which has again thrown the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on the defensive in the contest with Peiping.</p>
                        <p>This costly venture appears to have been based on the conviction that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had drifted too far in the direction of
       rapprochement with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> at the expense of the Soviet
       Union's standing in the Communist world. The new leaders, therefore, assigned
       first priority to restoring a more even balance. To gain freedom of maneuver in coping with
       the delicate problems of disarray in the Soviet bloc and the <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0307"/>world Communist movement, they sought to ensure against serious complications
       with the West by stressing that foreign policy differences were not involved in <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s downfall and by reaffirming their
       continuing commitment to peaceful coexistence and a further reduction of tensions. The new
       policy, however, not only required a general standstill in relations with the West but a more
       aggressive posture toward the “imperialists.” Appeals for Communist
       unity in the face of a growing imperialist threat were accompanied by an upsurge in Soviet
       denunciations of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy around the world.</p>
                        <p>In developing this policy, the new leaders had no illusions about Peiping's
       ambitions and antagonism. Their objective was not to seek a reconciliation but to find more
       effective means of combating the Chinese challenge. Peiping has tried to discredit the new
       Soviet line by charging that “in replacing <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, the new leaders of the <gloss target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss> simply
       changed the signboard and employed more cunning methods and subterfuges in order the better
       to push through and develop Khrushchevism. …”</p>
                        <p>The main feature of the new Soviet course was to disengage from <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s penchant for unilateral initiatives and pressures on
       foreign parties and to wrap Soviet moves in the mantle of multilateral consultations and
       decisions. Foreign parties were given to understand that the new leaders felt <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was responsible for bringing the dispute with China
       down to the level of personal antagonism. They conveyed the impression that although there
       would be no concessions on long-contested substantive issues, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> intended to abandon <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s “collision course” tactics and work
       toward a modus vivendi with China. Moscow dropped polemical attacks, called for
       “step-by-step” progress toward resolving difficulties, and constantly
       stressed the need for unity in the “common struggle against the common
       enemy-imperialism.” It also professed interest in
       “activizing” state relations with China and announced that proposals
       had been submitted to Peiping for expanding trade and scientific cooperation.</p>
                        <p>The most urgent problem at the outset was to find a way to retreat, at the least political
       cost, from the Communist “preparatory meeting” which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had unilaterally scheduled for 15 December. Although
       talks with <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> in early November produced no
       agreement, the Soviets worked out an arrangement with other parties to postpone this meeting.
       In contrast to the unilateral Soviet action last summer in convoking the December meeting,
       Pravda announced on 12 December that the meeting had been rescheduled for 1 March after
       “mutual consultations” with fraternal parties.</p>
                        <p>By far the most significant move in this unfolding policy was the dispatch in early
       February of the strong delegation headed by <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> to
       visit North Vietnam and North Korea, with two brief stopovers <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0308"/>in Peiping itself. Subsequent events have painfully brought home to the Soviet
       leaders that they greatly underestimated the strength of Peiping's reaction to
       what it was bound to consider impudent interference in China's exclusive sphere of
       influence.</p>
                        <p>The Russians apparently considered that the success of their new program depended to a
       great extent on a vigorous assertion of Soviet influence in and support for North Vietnam-the
       only socialist state engaged in active, although indirect, hostilities with the leader of the
       imperialist camp. It would have been difficult to evade this test since the Chinese had made
       an issue of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s equivocal reaction
       to the Tonkin Gulf incident last August. Talks with the North Vietnamese delegation to the
       Soviet revolution celebration last November may have encouraged the Russians to believe that
       opportunities existed for drawing Hanoi back toward a more “neutral”
       posture in the Sino-Soviet conflict, thus scoring a significant gain against the Chinese.</p>
                        <p>The decision to abandon <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
       policy of disengagement from the Indochina conflict probably was also motivated by the belief
       that a stronger Soviet presence was essential to discourage the possibility of direct <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> attacks against North Vietnam and to gain a greater voice in
       Hanoi's conduct of the war. There were indications last fall of Soviet concern
       that both sides were contemplating actions which could lead to a rapid escalation and
       confront the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> with awkward and dangerous decisions.
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s mission was thus partly to warn
       the North Vietnamese not to underestimate <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> determination to
       prevent a Communist victory in the South and to urge them to avoid actions which might
       provoke <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> retaliation and to play for time to allow political
       disintegration in Saigon to ripen.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s soundings of
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy in the first half of December apparently persuaded
       Moscow that the risks of this new policy were acceptable. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> sought to place inhibitions on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> actions by
       responding favorably, at first privately and later publicly, to the President's
       suggestion in his State of the Union message that Soviet leaders visit the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The initial Soviet reaction to the Viet Cong attack at Pleiku the day after <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> arrived in Hanoi displayed not only shock and
       indignation but a clear lack of foreknowledge of this operation. Private remarks by Soviet
       officials showed immediate recognition that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had
       been placed in a very difficult position of having to choose between giving North Vietnam
       military support or opening itself to Chinese charges of capitulation to the imperialists.
       While a few Soviet officials termed the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> air strike which
       followed the Pleiku attack an unfriendly act toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, a more widespread reaction among the Soviets was that the Chinese had inspired
       the Viet Cong raid in order to embarrass <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and
       disrupt Soviet-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> relations.</p>
                        <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0309"/>
                        <p>As this new phase of the Vietnamese war began the Soviets at first adopted a noncommittal
       posture, recognizing that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> air strikes and Chinese
       attacks on proposals for negotiations had at least temporarily closed the option of any
       specific Soviet proposals for a conference to deal with the crisis. They cautiously
       associated themselves with the French position on the need for negotiations, but insisted
       that talks would be impossible as long as <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> air attacks
       continued.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s carefully drawn statements in his
       26 February report<note n="2" xml:id="d106fn2">For text, see Current Digest of the Soviet
        Press, March 24, 1965, pp. 3–6.</note> on his Asian mission represented the limit to which
       the Soviets felt able to go at this stage. He avoided commitment to any specific proposal but
       voiced the desire of “peace-loving countries” for a solution
       “at a conference table” and called for an end to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> strikes in order to create conditions for exploring “avenues leading
       to the normalization of the situation.” But even this cautious formula drew an
       angry retort from Peiping that China would never bow to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
       blackmail and that “no socialist country should.”</p>
                        <p>The mutual recriminations between Moscow and Peiping over the 4 March anti-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> demonstration in Moscow, which Chinese students turned against
       Soviet police, destroyed what little remained of the new leadership's attempt to
       erect a facade of Communist unity.</p>
                        <p>The combined pressures of Chinese maneuvers to discredit Soviet policy in this crisis and
       the intensified pace of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-South Vietnamese air strikes in
       March forced the Soviets to retreat to the position that even preliminary discussions to
       arrange negotiations are impossible as long as bombings continue and that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, in any event, will never make North Vietnam's
       interests the “subject of a deal with anyone.”</p>
                        <p>Even Soviet attempts to regain influence in Hanoi by pledging military assistance
       apparently have run into trouble. Although <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and
        <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> have announced that this commitment is being
       implemented, Soviet officials have recently complained that the Chinese are interfering with
       military shipments to North Vietnam.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Although the Soviet leaders recognize that the Vietnam impasse will lead to a further
       deterioration in relations with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, they seem to believe
       that this will not lead to serious complications elsewhere. They have taken care to keep
       channels open to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and have privately stressed their
       interest in joint efforts to find a way out of the crisis.</p>
                        <p>The new regime, moreover, has continued to express interest in expanding trade and contacts
       with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and has avoided pressures <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0310"/>on sensitive points such as Cuba. Although the new Soviet
       leaders immediately reaffirmed <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
       pledges of support and assistance to the Castro regime, they have continued to urge a
       “normalization” in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Cuban relations
       and have refrained from reviving last year's campaign to halt <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> overflights. There are some indications of a more critical Soviet
       attitude toward Cuban economic failures and mismanagement and of greater pressures on Castro
       to support the Soviet position in the conflict with China.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s successors have been too
       preoccupied with domestic problems, the Vietnam crisis, and the abortive venture in
       international Communist affairs to give much attention to other major foreign policy
       questions. Their concern to reduce Soviet vulnerability to Chinese attacks in the present
       crisis atmosphere has been reflected in an apparent reluctance to resume the Geneva
       disarmament talks and to set a specific data for <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s visit to Britain.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets appear to be generally satisfied with the status quo in Central Europe. There
       are no signs of any major departures in their policy with respect to Berlin and a German
       peace treaty. They have continued the trend during <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s last two years of stressing the importance of European
       security as a means of covering the abandonment of the long Soviet campaign for a Berlin
       settlement and a peace treaty.</p>
                        <p>In seeking ways to further erode four-power responsibility for German reunification, the
       Soviets have recently shown greater interest in President de Gaulle's proposals
       for placing a German settlement in the broader framework of European security. They signaled
       their interest in beginning a dialogue with the French by appointing Deputy Foreign Minister
        <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> as ambassador to Paris. Pravda has praised the
       “candor and realism” of de Gaulle's views and stated that
       they “open interesting prospects.”</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>There have been no significant modifications in Moscow's orientation toward the
       Afro-Asian area. The new leaders emphasized the continuity in their policies, particularly on
       such key issues in the Sino-Soviet conflict as military assistance to India. Their attempt to
       develop a more effective strategy for dealing with the Chinese challenge, however, appears to
       have placed an even higher premium on strengthening Soviet influence in countries such as
       Indonesia, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Algeria, and other radical African
       states. The Soviets have continued <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s policy of establishing close relations not only with
       neutralist, anti-Western governments but with non-Communist ruling parties, such as those in
       Algeria and Mali.</p>
                        <p>The new leaders have maintained <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s policy of exploiting the Cyprus crisis with the aim of
       disrupting the southern flank of <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0311"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, bringing about the withdrawal of foreign troops and bases on
       the island, and complicating efforts to achieve a political settlement. They have persisted
       in efforts to please both sides without committing the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
       to full support of either. Moscow has carried out the military aid agreement with Cyprus
       signed two weeks before <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
       downfall and has continued vigorous opposition to any foreign military intervention. But it
       has balanced this policy by adopting a more favorable attitude toward Turkey.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Although the Soviets managed to avoid a complete debacle in their moves to liquidate
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s project for a new world
       Communist conference, the failure of their program to reassert Soviet leadership behind a
       facade of Communist unity against imperialism and the inconclusive results of the 19-party
       “consultative meeting” in early March have aggravated the manifold
       problems of dealing with the erosion of Soviet authority in the Communist world. Although the
       new leaders apparently intend to continue sporadic efforts to isolate and discredit the
       Chinese by demonstrating Peiping's unwillingness to participate in bilateral and
       multilateral consultations to resolve differences, this course holds little prospect for
       success in view of the reluctance of important foreign parties to join in any collective
       condemnation of China. Faced with this impasse, it seems likely that the Soviets will
       concentrate greater attention on cultivating ties with non-Communist leftist regimes and
       parties in Africa and Asia and encouraging Western Communist parties to form alliances with
       social democratic parties and other groups primarily on domestic issues which will minimize
       Communist ties with Moscow. This strategy is a continuation of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s efforts to counter Chinese claims to Communist orthodoxy
       by developing a loose grouping composed of pro-Soviet parties and non-Communist parties
       committed to a “noncapitalist” course in national development.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The new agricultural program testifies to the collective leadership's ability to
       make bold and far-reaching decisions on fundamental policy questions. It confirms that
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s successors have managed so
       far to avoid the kind of stultifying discord and immobility that caused previous ventures in
       collective leadership to fail. But the new regime will face a formidable array of problems
       over the next year or so in both domestic and foreign policy, which almost certainly will
       increase pressures on this inherently unstable power structure and strengthen the tendency to
       disruptive intrigues and divisions.</p>
                        <p>The agricultural program will require adjustments in the economy, particularly on the vital
       matter of resource allocations. It will be difficult <pb n="284" xml:id="pg_284" facs="0312"/>to prevent the transformation of these decisions into issues of power and prestige among
       competing power hierarchies. These inherent conflicts of interest are likely to be sharpened
       by the process of formulating the line to be presented to the 23rd party congress which,
       under party statutes, should be held sometime this year. The drafting of the five-year plan
       which becomes effective next January will also require decisions that cannot fail to
       influence power relationships. The selection of new central committee members prior to the
       party congress seems likely to intensify competition and discord among the top leaders.</p>
                        <p>In the foreign policy field, the new regime will not be able to evade decisions in the
       Vietnam crisis which are bound to have profound effects on the struggle with China and on the
       future orientation of Soviet relations with the West. The issues in Vietnam far transcend
       immediate tactical questions of support for Hanoi and attitude toward negotiations, because
       the Chinese leaders are exploiting this conflict to discredit the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s position on “national liberation wars” and
       its “peaceful coexistence” policy toward the West.</p>
                        <p>In surveying the wreckage of their design to restore Soviet leadership in the Communist
       world, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s successors have good
       reason to entertain some rueful thoughts about the wisdom of his policy in dealing with the
       Chinese and avoiding involvement in the Indochina duel between the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Peiping and Hanoi. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had
       recognized that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was operating at great disadvantage
       vis-á-vis China in this area and that no Soviet interests would be served by
       political or military intervention in this duel.</p>
                        <p>The difficult position in which the Soviets now find themselves seems likely to intensify
       the hazards in trying to pursue simultaneously the conflicting requirements of domestic
       reform and growth, which favor stability and a détente line with the West, and the
       drive to outbid and outmaneuver the Chinese in a vain quest for
       “leadership” of the Communist world. This condition of political
       schizophrenia has long been at the root of Soviet frustrations and abrupt swings in policy
       lines. Although it is beyond the capacity of any Soviet regime to make a clearcut choice
       between these conflicting purposes, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s decisions in the last year of his rule tended to fall on
       the side of defending and advancing the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s
       interests and need as a great power at the expense of its pretensions to Communist
       leadership.</p>
                        <p>The new leaders now are faced with the same problem of determining the order of priorities
       in dealing with foreign and Communist affairs. Their uncertainty and hesitation in handling
       the Vietnam crisis reflects awareness of the high stakes involved. But the miscarriage of
       their first major foreign enterprise has resulted not only in a painful demonstration of the
       incompatibility between Soviet and Chinese objectives <pb n="285" xml:id="pg_285" facs="0313"/>but in a forceful reminder of the coincidence of Soviet and <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> interests in blocking an expansion of Chinese power. Moscow will have little
       freedom of action as long as the Vietnam crisis remains acute. But the experience of the past
       two months, coupled with the urgent requirements of domestic economic reform and growth,
       seems likely over the longer term to strengthen the Soviet leaders' incentive to
       move back toward détente and accommodation with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> as the main focus of their policy. (Secret)</p>

        with the West and dampening inflammatory conflicts around the world rather than in
        ideological posturing. (Ibid., POL 27 VIET S)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Much as I would like to be able to agree with thesis advanced by Amb <persName corresp="#p_BCA1">Bowles</persName> in reftel it will be clear from my own reporting that I
       cannot do so. Soviet leadership has already “come down on other side,”
       not because of “ideological slogans” but because they regard this
       posture as fundamental to justifying the very existence of Communist Party monopoly rule in
       this country and of the Communist system in the world.</p>
                        <p>2. Soviets have never been prepared to change their policies in response to appeals to
       reason from outside. Historically any shifts in Soviet outlook have come about because of
       changes in their assessment of what Marxists call objective conditions. Any influence that we
       might have on situation must be directed to these conditions. In Korea Soviets learned that
       use of overt military force across national boundaries would not be tolerated. In Berlin,
       Soviets recognized that we are prepared to go to bat in defense our vital interests. In Cuba,
       Soviets learned additional lesson that we have will and determination to use nuclear <pb n="286" xml:id="pg_286" facs="0314"/>force in order defend our basic interests. In other
       words, it was what we did and not what we said that forced Soviets to “come to
       their senses” in past crises in East-West relations.</p>
                        <p>3. In Vietnam, basic issue is Soviet determination to aid “national liberation
       movement” from outside and our equal determination to prevent this. I see no hope
       of change in Soviet policy this regard until Moscow convinced that to achieve their
       objectives they must be prepared risk military confrontation with us. In other words, in my
       view, situation in Vietnam must get worse before it gets better.</p>
                        <p>4. Meanwhile, we must reckon with fact that Soviets and their Socialist allies are
       confident that we in time will be forced by weak political base in Saigon as well as
       pressures both within our own country and by our allies, to temper our own objectives in the
       area. So long as this confident assessment of situation persists there is certainly nothing
       we can do in way of rational appeal to Soviets that would force them to retreat.</p>
                        <p>5. Added to this, of course, is the imperative upon Moscow at the present time to
       demonstrate its loyalty to a socialist ally and its militancy in backing national liberation
       movements in its contest with Peiping for leadership of world Communist movement. In my view,
       this is not a question of making Soviets realize perils of continuing alliance with Peiping.
       To me it is clear beyond any question that Soviets have already made up their minds on China,
       that they know that the breach with Peiping is deep and permanent. What they are not prepared
       to do is recognize their defeat by Peiping for control of world Communist movement.</p>
                        <p>6. In sum, there can be no “grand global deal” with Soviets at this
       stage of history. Best we can hope for is tacit agreement between ourselves and Soviets on
       means by which continuing conflict is waged. Our task at the moment is, as in Cuba, to
       demonstrate that we are firm but flexible; and in the longer run to convince Soviets that
       they, in fact, seriously jeopardize their national interests by continued revolutionary
       militancy and by centering their competition with Peiping on this element alone.</p>

                        <p>In view of the possibility that the Senate calendar might soon permit consideration of the
       Consular Convention, the Department has held discussions with interested officials and
       members of the Senate on this subject. While it is believed that we should press ahead for
       ratification of the Consular Convention at the first appropriate moment, it has also been
       agreed that this is not an appropriate moment, due primarily to the unfavorable atmosphere
       created by developments in Vietnam. It is the opinion of those concerned that the Convention
       would encounter considerable resistance in the Senate if submitted under the present
       circumstances. Therefore, the Department has decided to postpone any efforts to bring about
       Senate consideration of the treaty at this time.</p>

        Cultural Officer at the U.S. Embassy and the first African-American assigned there, persona
        non grata for carrying on work hostile to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> among
        African students.</note> We have following thoughts including those on possible retaliation
       against Soviet Embassy Washington in response to <gloss target="#t_PNG1">PNG</gloss> action
       against Garnett.</p>
                        <p>1. Although Soviets undoubtedly hope by their move re Garnett and lurid publicity being
       given to case in Soviet media to discourage African students in Moscow from further contacts
       with U.S. and other embassies, we are not sure that this will prove to be case. Possibility
       exists that move may boomerang and serve to stimulate even greater discontent among African
       students. We will be alert to this situation in immediate future and believe it is factor to
       be considered in determining our own course of action.</p>
                        <p>2. So far as reaction in Africa and West is concerned, it seems likely that Soviets could
       receive bad black eye from their transparent attempt to place blame on Garnett for obvious
       and widespread discontent among African students in <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. We
       should not deflect world attention from this aspect of case by immediate <gloss target="#t_PNG1">PNG</gloss> action against Soviets.</p>
                        <p>3. On specific issue of reciprocity in Garnett case, we feel that at some point we should
       retaliate, and that <gloss target="#t_PNG1">PNG</gloss> action to be most effective should be
       against relatively higher ranking member Soviet Embassy. However, in short term, there may be
       some deterrent value vis-á-vis Soviets in delaying such action and leaving threat
       of <gloss target="#t_PNG1">PNG</gloss> move hanging over heads Soviet Embassy.</p>
                        <p>In sum, therefore, Embassy's view is that we should retaliate for Garnett <gloss target="#t_PNG1">PNG</gloss> action but that move should be delayed for reasons suggested

                        <p>A. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s successors, seeking new
       ways to cope with the Chinese challenge to Moscow's authority, have altered the
       priorities of Soviet foreign policy. They began to do so very shortly after gaining power and
       well before present <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policies in Vietnam went into effect.
       The new leaders did not set out deliberately to reverse the course of East-West relations
       which had developed after the Cuban missile crisis. Rather, they gave first priority to
       efforts to repair the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s position in its own
       camp and in the underdeveloped world, consciously accepting as a consequence a deterioration
       of relations with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. (Paras. 1–4)</p>
                        <p>B. This revision of policy has led the Soviet leaders to re-enter the Vietnamese crisis and
       to assume increasing commitments there. Vietnam has now become a pivotal issue in Soviet
       foreign policy, setting narrow limits on Moscow's freedom of maneuver in other
       areas of East-West relations. (Paras. 5–7)</p>
                        <p>C. Nevertheless, Soviet conduct continues to reflect a concern to avoid high risks and a
       desire to remain in contact with Washington. In time, experience may persuade the Soviet
       leaders that competition with China on the latter's terms is unprofitable and that
       a hard-line foreign policy is inconsistent with efforts to promote domestic economic <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290" facs="0318"/>growth. During the next few months, however, we expect
       the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to give vigorous opposition to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> on a wide range of issues. We believe that present conditions,
       particularly the situation in Vietnam, virtually preclude Soviet willingness to improve
       relations with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>.<note n="3" xml:id="d110fn3">The

        Politics After <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>,” July 1, 1965.
        The estimate also concluded that though the new “collective leadership could
        endure for some time, we believe that there will be a strong tendency toward one-man
        rule” that could come to a head in 1966 or even sooner. (Central Intelligence

                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_SMA1">Suslov</persName> (Soviet Under Secretary in Secretariat)
       expressed gloom over present state US-Soviet relations, accusing <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> of, in effect, forcing <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> close ranks with
       ChiComs. Said he particularly depressed as result his recent visit to Moscow, where he found
       people speaking language entirely different from what he had become used to over past several
       years. Complained Soviet advocates of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet rapprochement,
       in which group he included himself, were now in extremely difficult position and were accused
       of being “apologists of American imperialism.” Said <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, whom he saw last week, also very depressed, and
       observed US “lucky” have man such as <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> as Soviet Ambassador in times like these. Expressed surprise <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has been able maintain restraint thus far, but was worried it
       might run out soon. Felt next several months would be crucial, but in spite of his pessimism,
       hoped for the best. Claimed Soviet solidarity with Socialist countries overriding factor in
       Soviet foreign policy, and suggested US should keep that in mind. Nevertheless, he believed
       basic precepts Sov foreign policy as expounded by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in his “simplistic” way <pb n="291" xml:id="pg_291" facs="0319"/>still valid but had to be handled differently in view changed
       circumstances (e.g., Soviet-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> bilateral deals not now
       possible). Stressed need for either <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> making a good-will gesture, but realized both extremely limited
       in their freedom of action at this time.</p>
                        <p>As to prospects for peaceful settlement Viet Nam, thought no negotiations could take place
       unless <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> stopped air raids in North Viet Nam. Suspension of
       raids for just a few days insufficient.</p>
                        <p>Commented no disarmament talks possible while bombs falling in Viet Nam. Opined solution
        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> financial problem would depend on general state <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations, rather than on what happens in Committee of
       33.</p>

                        <p>3599. At Spaso luncheon yesterday honor visiting MIT management professors, Gvishiani
        (<persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s son-in-law and Deputy Chief
       powerful State Coordinating Committee) expressed disappointment lack progress U.S.-Soviet
       trade relations. Admitting temporary lull in Soviet foreign procurement activities due
       reassessment priorities, he nevertheless complained American companies with few exceptions
       did not follow through despite fine talk business international round table conference and
       numerous visits by businessmen to Moscow.</p>
                        <p>I replied international situation undoubtedly affecting business decisions but expressed
       confidence many large American companies prepared do business; licensing policy offered ample
       opportunities for purchases.</p>
                        <p> Gvishiani then expressed disappointment that U.S. Govt, despite earlier statements on
       improving economic relations, was not taking action in trade field. He criticized what he
       described as greater U.S. interest in political aspects of trade than in actually increasing
       trade.</p>
                        <pb n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0320"/>
                        <p>I replied the President was moving our trade policy forward despite the tense international
       situation.</p>
                        <p>He had appointed Miller committee to help pave way for Congressional action. At this point,
        <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> (member State Coordinating Committee)
       interjected Miller committee's report not helpful.<note n="2" xml:id="d112fn2">On
        April 4 the White House announced the formation of a Special Presidential Committee on U.S.
        Trade Relations with Eastern European Countries and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, headed by J. Irwin Miller; see <ref target="#d25">Document 25</ref>.</note>
       Gvishiani nodded agreement. I said I understood they might not like certain aspects report,
       and I have my own reservations about certain parts, but report was part of process which
       would enable USG eventually negotiate on economic matters. I stressed our policy on improving
       relations with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had not changed; present tension not of
       our making but decision of Soviet Govt which cited Vietnam situation as incompatible good
       relations.</p>
                        <p>After brief recital Soviet Govt position, Gvishiani said this was matter outside his field,
       for politicians and diplomats to settle, but expressed hope business contacts would continue.
       This interest, he said, was demonstrated by his very presence at Spaso.</p>

        former reported that Nedelya, the weekly illustrated issue of Izvestia, carried a full-page

        activities of the American Embassy. The latter transmitted a translation of the
        article.</note> Subject: Nedelya Attack on Embassy Staff.</p>
                        <p>I had hoped to jump <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> personally on this

                        <p>I told both I had wished remind Foreign Minister my protests against physical attacks on
       Embassy earlier this year and protest vicious press attack on Embassy and its officers as
       even more damaging to Embassy operations and to U.S.-Soviet relations. Soviets knew as well
       as I Nedelya article complete fabrication and allegations against Toon and Logan entirely
       untrue.</p>
                        <p>Neither undertook any defense substance article or any rebuttal my charges re falsity its

                            <persName corresp="#p_SMN1">Smirnovsky</persName> indirectly expressed some regret, saying he
       recalled many conversations with me over the years to effect we should not approach political
       problems in terms of personalities or personal attacks. However, our political relations had
       deteriorated and in this case first offender had been United States in form Alsop
       article.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_ZLM1">Zamyatin</persName>, who unlike <persName corresp="#p_SMN1">Smirnovsky</persName>, said speaking personally and not for Foreign Minister, was more
       explicit in analyzing Nedelya article as precise reply to Alsop piece, pointing out in
       particular, Toon number three in American Embassy as is Lukyanov in Soviet Embassy. When I
       indignantly pointed out Nedelya, as supplement Izvestiya, official Soviet Govt paper, not
       comparable private writer for private American weekly, he argued Nedelya had separate
       independent editorial staff, could not be considered as directly-controlled govt paper like
       Izvestiya. In end, he said: “to use old Russian expression, (sic) we're
       even”.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comment:</p>
                        <p>(1) As suggested <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>, Nedelya article was clearly
       calculated riposte to Hoover testimony and more specifically Alsop article.</p>
                        <p>(2) Article stands on own as part of campaign of intimidation against African contacts with
       U.S. Embassy. I am sure it does not foreshadow any further action against Toon, whom Soviets
       realize experienced, objective expert with whom they will be dealing for long time to come;
       and at risk being disproved tomorrow, I believe PNG action also not likely against Logan.</p>
                        <p>(3) I must say that I regard provision information on Soviet Embassy personnel to Alsop as
       singularly irresponsible and I trust steps are being taken to establish responsibility. This
       is game at which Soviets with totally controlled press can always do us more harm than we can
       do them.</p>
                        <p>(4) I am sure my protests to <persName corresp="#p_SMN1">Smirnovsky</persName> and
        <persName corresp="#p_ZLM1">Zamyatin</persName> will be reported to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and other members apparatus involved. I hope Department
       officers will make similar remarks to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and
       associates. <pb n="294" xml:id="pg_294" facs="0322"/>However, I doubt that more formal
       protest would serve useful purpose, especially in view obvious official source material in
       Alsop article.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary said he thought that it would be useful to have a good discussion before the
       Ambassador returned to Moscow on consultation. He would suggest that such discussion deal
       with the broad aspects of policy, rather than details. We had a feeling that there had been a
       change in attitude in Moscow and we had received some indications that Moscow thought there
       had been a change in attitude in Washington. We ought to discuss the issues between us in
       some depth. As illustrative of the change of attitude, the Secretary pointed out that Soviet
       leaders had recently attacked the President personally, by name. We had been rather careful
       on this score and thought this was a rather important point. It had been a surprise to us
       when the President suggested that we go down the road to peace together, the Soviets
       responded by accusing him of double talk.<note n="2" xml:id="d114fn2">In a memorandum to the
        President for his evening reading on June 15, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Secretary referred to the fact that in an earlier conversation on Southeast Asia, he
       had mentioned the possibility of our repeated statements that we did not want a large war
       might have been misunderstood. He suggested that perhaps Hanoi thought they could have a
       larger war without any reaction from us. He suggested that the Ambassador <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295" facs="0323"/>check when the 325th <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
       Division moved and where. He thought this would help the Ambassador understand our feeling
       that Hanoi may have misunderstood. He went on to say that we wanted better relations but that
       there were some things we could not accept. He did not know whether there were other issues
       than Viet-Nam which may have affected the atmosphere. He knew that the Soviets did not now
       want to discuss Viet-Nam in detail, but as the two largest and most powerful nations in the
       world, we had great responsibilities and must do everything possible to avoid
       misunderstandings.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he wished to ask a personal question;
       namely, whether the State Department participated in the drafting of the
       President's Victory Day speech.<note n="3" xml:id="d114fn3">For text, see Public
        Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.
         Johnson</persName>, 1965, Book I, pp. 506–509.</note> When the Secretary replied in the
       affirmative, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he was disappointed. He
       said this was a day of memorial in which the Soviet people had lost twenty million killed. He
       said the speech had been particularly badly received because it had been made on that day. It
       was difficult from the speech to know who had been fighting whom and it almost looked as if
       it had been commemorating a war between the Soviet Union and the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said it had seemed to us that the Soviets were planning not a day of
       recollection of the agony of man that the late war represented, but an anti-German campaign.
       The Soviets had worked out arrangements on a theme that had made it difficult for us to
       participate along with them. The speeches that the Soviets had made on this day were not
       helpful from our point of view.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> interjected that at least the Soviet speeches
       showed that they and the United States had been together in the conflict. The Secretary went
       on to say that the Soviet speeches and propaganda had engaged in bitter attacks upon the West
       German Government and the people and that this had not been helpful.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> countered by stating that the Soviets had
       particularly resented the references in the speech to the liberation of East Germany because
       of the day on which it was made.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he had raised the question of drafting
       of the speech from a professional point of view. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> said that from a professional point of view, he thought the Soviets had
       made a mistake by sending out invitations referring to the celebration of the victory of the
       Soviet Union over Fascist Germany. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied
       that his own invitations had not been so worded, and that he had nevertheless had few
       representatives of the State Department present.</p>
                        <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0324"/>
                        <p>In reply to the Secretary's question as to what significance should be attached
       to the personal attacks upon the President, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
       hesitated for some time but then said that he supposed it was because the Soviets realized
       that the President was the center of power and was responsible for the policies that raised
       issues between us. He reverted to Viet-Nam and said he knew nothing about the 325th <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> Division, but pointed out that we had over fifty thousand men
       in South Viet-Nam and that even if there had been a Division from the North, the rebellion
       could not have been carried on unless it had been an indigenous one.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that this argument could be used the other way because our people were
       interlaced with the South Viet-Namese, working with them in the countryside on agricultural
       and other projects and that they would not be sustained in this work if the people of South
       Viet-Nam did not want them there. He stated it was the intervention from the North that
       brought in American troops.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked the Secretary how he saw the end of the
       story.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he could not predict the end because this depended upon two sides, but
       that there could be peace very quickly if Hanoi would stop doing what it was doing in the
       South. He said that there could be elections in both parts of Viet-Nam and that these people
       could live in peace. He then expressed his great disappointment over developments in Laos. We
       had thought that we had agreed to let the Laotians alone. They were not a warlike people and
       we were convinced that if they were left alone they would stop killing each other. The
       numbers of the North Viet-Namese in Laos never fell below six thousand and the International
       Control Commission was never allowed to come into Pathet Lao-held territory. He said this
       problem would have created a greater issue between our two countries if we had thought that
       the Soviets had had greater influence on the ground.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied that we could not say that the
       Soviets had violated any agreement, but the Soviets could produce a whole list of actions on
       our part. When the Secretary suggested that we should talk about that list, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that the Soviets' conscience was very
       clear. He went on to say that this was true even of bilateral relations. There had been no
       movement in this field but all of the matters were held up on the American side. When the
       Secretary referred to the Blagonravov/Dryden talks,<note n="4" xml:id="d114fn4">On June 8,
        1962, Hugh L. Dryden, Deputy Administrator of <gloss target="#t_NASA1">NASA</gloss>, and
        A.A. Blagonravov of the Soviet Academy of Sciences reached an agreement on cooperation in
        outer space. Talks on various projects had continued between Soviet and U.S. officials since
        that time.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied that there never had <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0325"/>been much cooperation in space, but that there had been no
       retreat on the Soviet side. He then mentioned that he had been awakened at three
       o'clock in the morning to assist us in stopping signal interference with our
       satellite communications. The Secretary said that their cooperation in this matter had been
       very much appreciated.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary concluded the conversation by suggesting that they meet in about a
       week's time, which would give the Ambassador an opportunity of finding out whether
       Moscow had any points to raise.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Toon</persName> were only other guests present. I had originally invited Keldysh, MGU

       declined. On behalf <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, Foreign Office had

       attend but subsequently called Embassy to advise that after rechecking his calendar <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had found it possible to accept. I suspect that when

       other invitees they should decline in order permit <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
       engage in private, frank conversation which in fact took place. Conversation ranged over wide
       spectrum and throughout Gromyko was affable and gave impression of genuine desire to resume
       dialogue on basic issues which initiated in post-Cuba period. Following are significant
       points in exchange relating to Vietnam and <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Sov
       relations.</p>

       convey two basic points. In first place, he said, Soviets are not authorized and cannot
       negotiate on behalf of North Vietnam. Vietnamese situation must be discussed with <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. He would point out that so far as Soviet position is

                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would caution the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> that no progress could be made if any future approach to <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> should be cast in “insulting” terms as it had been
       previously. For <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to announce suspension of hostile action
       against <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and simultaneously to inform <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> that unless it behaved according to our prescription the
       punishment would be resumed was bound to lead us nowhere. Secondly, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> stressed that it has been and continues to be
       fundamental Soviet policy to seek improvement in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet
       bilateral relations. He was compelled to observe, however, that Soviet Government had been
       disappointed by drastic change in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy since elections,
       and Soviets could not avoid feeling that policy now pursued by President Johnson in most
       instances paralleled that endorsed by <persName corresp="#p_GB1">Goldwater</persName> in
       electoral campaign. I made following comments on <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s remarks. I said <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
       Government fully recognized difficulties faced by Soviet Government in dealing with
       Vietnamese situation; obviously Soviet maneuverability was restricted by attitude of Hanoi
       and to certain extent Peking. On other hand we had hoped that Soviet Government would be
       prepared to bring its influence to bear on Hanoi in effort to bring about peaceful settlement
       of Vietnamese problem which neither of us, I felt, wished to see escalated to a dangerous
       degree. Meanwhile, I thought <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> should recognize
       that current <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy of support for South Vietnam was laid
       down 10 years ago and had been followed consistently by three administrations. Recently, of
       course, degree of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> support had increased but this had only
       been in response to step-up in hostile and terroristic activities of forces controlled by
       North Vietnam rather than change in our basic policy. Equally, there had been no change in
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy with regard to our bilateral relations with Soviet
       Union. We have consistently taken position that despite current difficulties, particularly in
       Vietnam, we desire continuing improvement in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet
       bilateral relations on which such significant start had been made in 1963. It was our
       impression from public statements of Soviet leadership and Soviet press comment that it was
       Soviet attitude that in this respect had undergone a basic change. They had in fact flatly
       stated both privately to me and then publicly, that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
       activities in Vietnam were incompatible with continued improvement <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations. It was therefore reassuring to me personally to have <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> restate in positive terms his government's
       position in favor of improvement <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0327"/>of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet bilateral relations. I could assure him that we would do
       our part toward this end.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: It is entirely possible of course that reason for <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s appearance at Spaso was simply to satisfy
       his curiosity about Kennan whom he had met only briefly shortly after the war, to make
       appropriate official gesture following 1952 <gloss target="#t_PNG1">PNG</gloss> action, and
       to attempt to influence views of a prominent representative of American academic community.
       However, it became obvious that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had come
       specifically prepared to make to me statement summarized above. It is obvious from this
       account that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was not prepared or authorized go
       much beyond officially stated Sov position, particularly on Vietnam. I had impression,
       however, particularly from his positive comment on US-Sov relationship (which does, of
       course, differ from official position), his affable mood, and his almost wistful recall of
       1963 atmosphere that there is perhaps some new flexibility in Sov posture. It seemed to me
       that he was trying to suggest that Soviet Government finds itself in extremely awkward
       position, that it genuinely desires to see the heat taken out of Vietnamese situation, that
       this can be done only by direct approach to Hanoi accompanied by cessation of bombing. He
       seemed to imply some hope that if this should be done Hanoi's response would be
       positive and the <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> Gov would then find it possible and
       desirable to resume the dialogue with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and restore the
       hopeful relationship which existed in 1963.<note n="5" xml:id="d115fn5">In a memorandum to

                        <p>In reply to a question from the Secretary, the Ambassador said that he was sailing from New
       York early Thursday morning, July eighth and planned to leave Washington Tuesday evening. If
       necessary, he could stay over until Wednesday.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the President might wish to see the Ambassador before he departed,
       but this would only be known after the President returned to Washington. The Secretary said
       he would let <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> know as soon as he found out
       anything.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary inquired what questions about the United States the Ambassador thought he
       would get when he returned home.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he was sure he would be asked what
       the plans of the American Administration were, particularly with respect to Viet-Nam. The
       United States talked of its readiness to settle the conflict but its actions took the ground
       out from under such declarations. Until the bombing of North Viet-Nam stopped, it was
       difficult to imagine how one could even approach negotiations for a settlement.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that as a matter of broad Government policy, the United States would
       like to see improved relations with the Soviet Union. There had been no change in this
       policy. He said this was why in their last talk he had mentioned the personal attacks on
       President Johnson.<note n="2" xml:id="d117fn2">See <ref target="#d114">Document
        114</ref>.</note> The President has tried to keep from arousing feeling in the United States
       against the Soviet Union. These attacks on him, however, aroused feelings among the American
       people against the Soviet Union. If we were not careful, opportunities to improve relations
       would be closed because of the aroused feelings of our people. The Secretary pointed out that
       his own language was always moderate on such issues.</p>
                        <pb n="302" xml:id="pg_302" facs="0330"/>
                        <p>The Secretary continued that in the broadest sense, the key problem between us at the
       present time was that of Southeast Asia. We have conflicting impressions with regard to the
       Soviet attitude toward discussing these issues. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in Vienna<note n="3" xml:id="d117fn3">See <ref target="#d115fn4">footnote 4, Document 115</ref>.</note> had indicated he had no desire to discuss these in
       any formal way and the Secretary had the same impression with respect to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. On the other hand, the Secretary was aware that the
       Ambassador had discussed these issues with many others.</p>
                        <p>[Here follow 7 paragraphs of discussion on Vietnam.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> said that with reference to bilateral
       relations which the Ambassador had mentioned, he thought he might like to know that Senator
        <persName corresp="#p_FW1">Fulbright</persName> was initiating closed hearings on the
       Consular Convention in order to ascertain whether we could move on this matter. He said,
       also, that the President and Senator <persName corresp="#p_FW1">Fulbright</persName> were
       actively considering the possibilities of trade with the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he had reported his
       last talk with the Secretary in which the Secretary had said he had the impression that
       Moscow thought our policy had changed. He said frankly that Moscow did think there had been a
       change of policy from that of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and
       from the position taken in the election period as well as from the talks that he had had with
       the Secretary. By way of example, he cited the ever increasing United States involvement in
       Viet-Nam, the bombing of a socialist state, the United States intervention in the Dominican
       Republic, and in the Congo. He also referred to the financial question in the United Nations
       and the different plans that had been developed for an <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> or
       similar arrangement. He also cited the President's statement of May seventh,<note n="4" xml:id="d117fn4">For text, see Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States:
         <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>, 1965, Book I, pp. 506–509.</note>
       which Moscow had considered was hostile to the Soviet Union. He pointed out that all of this
       had affected our relations. He said that Moscow still supported the policy of peaceful
       coexistence and thought that the deterioration in relations was not the fault of the Soviet
       Union. He pointed out, however, that one could not look at bilateral relations in a vacuum.
       The United States Government must have known that its decision to bomb North Viet-Nam would
       result in a worsening of relations with the Soviet Union. The United States action against
       North Viet-Nam had no perspective and was very dangerous. The Viet-Namese people were
       determined to fight for their freedom and the socialist countries were determined to help and
       to oppose aggression.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary interrupted to ask if the first step was not to pull North and South Viet-Nam
       apart militarily.</p>
                        <p>
                            <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303" facs="0331"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> repeated that the United States bombing and
       the increase in our troops in South Viet-Nam pulled the ground out from under our peaceful
       statements. The Soviet Union thought that the four-point proposal of North Viet-Nam was a
       good basis for solution. He added, however, that the Soviet Union does not represent North
       Viet-Nam nor the National Liberation Front. They had not asked the Soviet Union to represent
       them.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said it would be a mistake for the Soviet Union to conclude that there had
       been a change in the United States policy since the <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> days. In those days we had had serious crises and he mentioned tension
       over Berlin initiated at the Vienna discussions. He said that our attitude in the United
       Nations was based upon our interpretation of the Charter. We hoped the matter could be
       settled. We had led no crusade during the two years that the Soviet Union was behind in
       paying its assessments but when Article 19 came into operation, we had serious problems. Even
       if the Soviet Union had paid, we would have had a serious problem with France. It was not
       only a question of Charter interpretation, but a question of our relations with the Congress
       because of the legal differences between voluntary and compulsory payments. We had
       encountered difficulty this year with regard to the appropriation for the regular United
       Nations budget because of this matter. The Secretary also pointed out that this question of
       United Nations dues was not a recent development but was due to the fact that the Soviets had
       let their arrears go beyond the two year rule. The Secretary also pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> had been initiated under President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>. It would not be correct for Moscow to conclude that because we do not
       abandon the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> that we are following a policy hostile to the
       Soviet Union. We know that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> does not represent a
       proliferation of nuclear weapons. The Soviet Government takes a different view. It would be a
       great tragedy if we can't find some way to move ahead on the question of
       proliferation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> inquired how this could be done and asked if
       the United States position was basically the same.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that the question would be reviewed after the German elections, but
       without an international understanding, many nations could move in this direction. Nuclear
       weapons were becoming easier and cheaper to make. Perhaps nothing could be done for the time
       being, but it would be tragic if we could not halt the spread of nuclear weapons, and, in any
       event, there was no basis for concluding that there was a change in United States policy.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the Dominican Republic, the Secretary said we were fully informed on the
       activities of the two Communist parties in that country. Both were in touch with Castro, and
       this constituted a problem. We would not permit them to arm civilian bands to take over <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0332"/>the country by force. There would be elections there
       and a constitutional government would be formed.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the Congo, the Secretary said that the upper circles in the Soviet Union
       know that we are aware that Soviet arms were sent to the Congo rebels through Egypt, Algeria,
       and other countries. We concluded that this was a change in the policy of the Soviet
       Government. The Soviet leaders should know that we are not naive in this matter.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said, as he had indicated in the previous conversation with respect to the
       President's speech on May seventh, that we were well aware of the plans of the
       Soviet Union to use this occasion for sharp attacks on the German Federal Republic. This got
       in the way of any joint commemoration of the day we should have celebrated together.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> pointed out that the Soviet Union had
       particularly resented the references in the speech to liberation, presumably of Eastern
       Europe. He pointed out that this harkened back to a policy of one of the
       Secretary's predecessors. The Soviet Union had given us no grounds to reopen this
       question.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that when we talked of building bridges, we had in mind improved
       relations with the countries of Eastern Europe, including the Soviet Union. He reminded the
       Ambassador that there was a flood and torrent of talk constantly coming out of the socialist
       countries with respect to Wars of Liberation. These ideological differences between us exist,
       but the Soviet Union devoted much more propaganda and activity to these differences than we
       do.</p>
                        <p>In reply to a question, the Secretary said that our recent talk with the Chinese Communists
       in Warsaw had taken the usual course. He said, however, that some messages we had received
       from the Chinese seemed to mean that they wanted to get the Soviet Union and the United
       States into major conflict with each other. This should not be allowed to happen. When
       Dobrynin asked what these messages were, the Secretary said he was not at liberty to go into
       details.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked whether the Secretary believed that our
       bombing of North Viet-Nam would lead somewhere. He referred to the wartime experiences with
       bombing and said that the Soviets did not think that this activity could lead to a
       settlement.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said the Ambassador must realize that the 325th Division in South Viet-Nam
       was killing South Viet-Namese and Americans. We were not going to allow them to do this and
       to bomb our Embassy and people in restaurants, and then sit in a safe haven and be secure in
       carrying out such operations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> pointed out that the Secretary seemed to
       consider that everything was the fault of the North. He did not appear to recognize that
       there were forces in the South opposed to the Government. He cited an article by Gordon
       Walker to the effect that the Viet Cong enjoyed considerable support of the people of South
       Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0333"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the United States forces were in South Viet-Nam only because of
       what the North was doing against the South. He said that when the sects in the South were
       opposing the Government as well as some other elements there, we did not put in United States
       forces-nor, for that matter, did we do so as a result of the activities of the indigenous
       Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that we were fighting the Viet Cong
       now.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we were also fighting the North Viet-Namese and fighting Viet Cong,
       supplied with arms and direction from the North. Why should we talk to the NLF in regard to
       the North Viet-Namese Division in the South? We did not go into Viet-Nam until the North
       intervened.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we had many prisoners that came from the North. He asked whether
       the 325th Division would go home if we stopped bombing.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> noted that the Secretary said
       “if.”</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if we should leave those who are supplying the arms and
       matériel and directing the operations in the South to sit safely in the North.
       That was why he had asked the Ambassador some time ago what else would happen if the bombing
       stopped. Referring to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s remark
       that we should stop and see, the Secretary inquired how long does one have to stop. He
       repeated that both countries must be interested in better relations. This was an imperative
       of history. He observed, however, that some Soviets seemed to follow the line that
       “what is mine is mine, and what is yours must be discussed and divided up
       again.” <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had told him that North
       Viet-Nam was socialist and would remain so, and that he would talk only about South Viet-Nam.
       The agreement we had reached about Laos had not proved to be worth anything. When <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that we had violated the agreement, the Secretary
       replied we had not done so until we had found out that it was being violated by North
       Viet-Nam. He said we could accept full compliance with the agreement on both sides and would
       be very glad to know how to get to that position.</p>
                        <p>On the question of safe haven, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> pointed
       out that we had thought it important that Peking take note of the fact that this kind of
       activity could not be carried on without any reaction.</p>
                        <p>In concluding the interview, the Secretary wished the Ambassador a good journey and said
       that he would be in touch with him about the possibility of his seeing the President.<note n="5" xml:id="d117fn5">No record of any meeting with the President has been found, although

        standard attack on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, a standard speech in favor of

                        <p>138. For President and Sec State from <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>. I
       had three hours and a quarter talk with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> this
       morning in Stalin-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> old office in Kremlin. He
       was alone except for <persName corresp="#p_SMN1">Smirnovsky</persName>, head of USA section
       Foreign Office and a notetaker. <persName corresp="#p_SVM1">Sukhodrev</persName> interpreted
       for both of us. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> and Emb Off Brement accompanied
       me.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was completely negative, in fact at times
       insulting though occasionally with a smile.</p>
                        <p>I told him I had no message or authority to negotiate but would gladly explain <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> position on any subject he wished and answer any questions. It
       was important to avoid any misunderstanding of each other's intentions. For
       example, I gathered from Soviet press that they thought President Johnson had changed
       President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s policies, whereas the
       fact was President Johnson was carrying on the same policies and objectives. I explained that
       President Johnson had sincerely desired to come to Soviet Union, meet and talk with him and
       his colleagues, that he believed in values of personal discussions and that he was anxious
       strengthen objective of peace by finding ways to overcome differences and settle
       disputes.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> commented that if I was finished with my
       statement, he would expound the Soviet positions in confidence and with expectation his
       remarks would not reach press. They had voted for Johnson against <persName corresp="#p_GB1">Goldwater</persName> although their ballots could not be counted, as they had hoped
       President Johnson's election would make possible progress in our relations. Our
       bilateral relations, he maintained, were the most important subject in maintaining peace. He
       then listed six points which he considered most important (1) non-proliferation; (2) ending
       all nuclear tests; (3) reduction nuclear weapons; (4) reduction overall military
       expenditures; (5) increase in our commercial transactions; and (6) <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307" facs="0335"/>closer personal contacts. These problems were difficult of
       solution, but they had been hoping for progress and that trust and confidence between our two
       countries could be developed. Frankly they had lost confidence and he would state why. He
       said there were dangerous forces at work and mentioned West German revanchism. He also stated
       that there were others who want to bring our two nations at loggerheads.</p>
                        <p>Since President Johnson's election antagonism had grown. The multilateral
       nuclear force in Europe was aimed at Soviet Union and <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was
       thereby protecting German revanchism.</p>
                        <p>He went so far as to say the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had become a symbol of
       revanch-ism in Europe, (possibly having Eastern Europe in mind).</p>
                        <p>Furthermore the United States was trying to strangle national liberation movements
       everywhere in world. In this we would fail as attempts to strangle NLM's had never
       been successful. Another factor, he said, is that unlike <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>,
       Soviet Govt always strictly abides by all understandings even informal and mentioned as
       example understanding with President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> on
       voluntary arms reduction by mutual example. <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had done
       its part in accordance with statement of Dobrynin to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> in cutting expenditures by 500,000,000 rubles, whereas we had increased our
       expenditures $700,000,000 to pay for “your war in Vietnam.” President
       Johnson had also made statements against the Soviet Union (he mentioned that I had done so
       also) and had ignored the Soviet Govt wishes in regard to <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
       and other matters. He concluded this part of this statement by saying <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> cannot dictate to others by force.</p>
                        <p>I refuted his charges emphasizing <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> as a means of
       preventing proliferation in Europe of individual national nuclear capability. I tediously
       went through post war history of Soviet aggressive attitude in Europe under Stalin as basis
       for formation <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>A lighter touch arose when I pointed out <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> was a method
       by which a number of fingers had to pull the nuclear trigger. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> asked why arrangement should not be truly multilateral thereby including
       the Soviet Union as well. I agreed that was an objective to which we could well address
       ourselves.</p>
                        <p>I underlined the dangerous situation that arose in Latin America and other areas where the
       Soviets support NLM's that were in no sense indigenous but imported from outside.
       I referred specifically to Venezuela where terrorists were trained outside the country and
       were sent back with arms to attempt to overthrow a democratically elected government. This
       led at last to Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> asked if I truly
       believed there was a legitimate government in Saigon. I countered by asking him if he truly
       believed the NLF was an independent movement or aided and abetted by North Vietnam.</p>
                        <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0336"/>
                        <p>This led to another prolonged discussion in which he accused first me and then President
       Johnson of pretense contending “you can't believe what you
       say.” I explained the hard information gained over last three and half years of
       Viet Cong direction and support by North Vietnam and questioned the validity of the sources
       of his information. He maintained that he knew the facts. At this point he indicated he had
       another engagement and had nothing more to say unless I had some constructive proposal. I
       referred to the fact that we hadn't discussed our bilateral problems he had
       mentioned, including normalization of our commercial relations. He responded to this and
       asked how long I was remaining in the Soviet Union explaining he would be away till Monday
       evening on visit to Riga. It was arranged I would see Matskevich, new Agricultural Minister,
       whom I had known in 1959 and possibly take a trip outside Moscow. He agreed to see me on his
       return-hopefully Wednesday.</p>
                        <p>The conversation was tense at some moments and <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> and I gained impression he was following a line agreed upon with his
       colleagues in advance.</p>
                        <p>I emphasized several times that he must understand President Johnson had overwhelming
       support of the Congress and the American people and that he would stand firm on the
       commitment taken by President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> a decade ago
       to the people of South Vietnam to protect their right to determine their own future and that
       North Vietnam would not be permitted to take over <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> by
       force. President Johnson was ready to undertake discussions without preconditions. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, however, said they could not influence this question.
       Hanoi was the responsible party and that we should approach them. He added “of
       course people with the noise of bombs in their ears are not anxious to negotiate.”
       He also complained that our actions are helping Peiping in its dispute against the Soviet
       Union.</p>

       disarmament; (2) the importance of direct bilateral relations between our two countries; and

       much that the Soviet Union will join in a constructive approach to these problems and he
       agrees with the Chairman as to the special importance of non-proliferation”.<note n="4" xml:id="d119fn4">A guidance along these lines was transmitted to <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> in telegram 227 to Moscow, July 20, for the talk with
         <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. (Johnson Library, National Security File,
        Country File, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, Vol. X)</note> As you see, I did not
       state the above as a message from the President.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, I told him that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC1">Foster</persName> would
       head the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Delegation at Geneva and asked him whether he
       could inform me who would head theirs. He said he couldn't because the decision
       had not <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310" facs="0338"/>been reached but he could assure us that it
       would be a responsible official fully empowered to act and report and “not just
       sit on the fence”. Commenting on my statement as a whole, he said he was pleased
       to learn President is concerned about same problems that bothered him. He was personally
       convinced progress could be made on the questions which we had discussed and to which
       President had reacted if it were not for Vietnam. The Vietnamese problem is an impediment to
       the solution of many important problems such as disarmament, nuclear weapons and the like. It
       was his personal opinion that if it were not for Vietnam issue many approaches could be found
       to disarmament, possibly by a high level meeting, not necessarily in the Soviet Union or the
       United States, prior to a disarmament conference-a meeting of two or more heads of states or
       governments might reach prior understanding in principle and make conference more productive.
       On questions relating to nuclear arms and disarmament, no side can be dishonest since the
       truth will come out and destroy mutual confidence. Naturally, progress could be made by
       conventional methods but faster progress might be made by unconventional methods. The Vietnam
       problem which is a small problem in itself thus becomes large and influences all important
       issues.</p>
                        <p>In answer to my query as respects meeting, he replied his ideas were not worked out but he
       would not exclude either bilateral or multilateral high level meetings. For example, in
       connection with non-proliferation both forums could be useful. He emphasized real relief
       throughout the world if agreement in these fields could be reached.</p>
                        <p>I referred to the fact that <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, France and unfortunately
       Peiping now involved in nuclear question and asked him whether the problem of dealing with
       Chinese might be discussed bilaterally. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
       replied the Chinese were not the major issue. It was correct to say <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> are only real owners of nuclear
       weapons. Others are not now important. Today, however, science is developing inexpensive
       methods which will enable many to make nuclear weapons and then there will be no guarantees
       that a mad man like Hitler could not come along. This is why steps must be taken to prevent
       any proliferation and that is why American proposal to pool nuclear weapons which amounts to
       giving weapons to Germans, arouses such emotional opposition in <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Soviets would be forced to respond by sharing weapons with their own
       allies.</p>
                        <p>I commented President would fully share first part of his statement. But as respects <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had
       pointed out to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> Soviets should sign
       non-proliferation treaty and thus prevent forever independent possession nuclear weapons by
       Germany. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> must believe that we do not want
       Germany to possess independent nuclear weapons, as we, like Soviets, had twice suffered from
       aggressive German leadership.</p>
                        <p>
                            <pb n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0339"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> replied that we are mistaken when we say our
       policy would prevent acquisition nuclear weapons by Germany. He was convinced we are
       profoundly wrong and our policy has its effects in France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands
       and indeed all over Europe. He stated: “The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
       pretends <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> does not exist. But it does exist and develops
       and a whole new generation has grown up which does not even know West Germany. <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> sets West Germans against East Germans and this puts us into
       conflict. <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is particularly active in supporting West Germans
       against us, saying you do not wish offend the West Germans. I know many leaders in Western
       Europe; they are absolutely not interested or concerned about reunification of
       Germany.” He concluded that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> support to this
       non-existent problem generates tensions. Question of Germany cannot be solved in a day.
       However, it could be handled in such a way so as to create difficulties or it could be
       handled so as to preserve quiet until the Germans themselves get together.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy in support of unification of Germany
       had been established in 1946 and had not been changed since. We agreed this was matter that
       could not be settled at today's meeting.</p>
                        <p>I then inquired just when he thought a high level meeting could be held on nuclear
       questions. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> replied this would only take place
       when Vietnam issue leaves the scene. It would not be possible earlier since everybody would
       think meeting only discussing Vietnam. He believed such a meeting possible and necessary but
       only after achievement of political solution of Vietnam. What is immediately necessary is to
       end war in Vietnam as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>I replied this is exactly what President wants as he has frequently stated. However, I had
       gathered from <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> Soviets would not consider this
       a matter in their hands but rather for Hanoi. I stressed again President does not consider
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in conflict with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on
       Vietnam but only with aggression from North Vietnam against South Vietnam and hopes this
       issue will not interfere with progress in bilateral relations. I agreed meeting before
       Vietnam settlement would probably bring about world reaction he described, but stressed it
       was thus all the more important to get Vietnam issue to conference table as soon as
       possible.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> commented we had different approaches to
       Vietnam and he did not want to rehearse last talk. He was sure however that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was to blame for whole issue and all that is happening in
       Southeast Asia. He cited my reference to danger of conflict from miscalculations and said
       maybe this is exactly what is happening in Vietnam. I repeated that President would take
       necessary action—but only necessary action—to stop aggression. I
       respected <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s sincerity and supposed
       necessary let time and events and possibly intervention of mutual friends work matter out.
       However, I again stressed hope everything would be <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312" facs="0340"/>done to minimize influence this issue on our bilateral relations. I then referred to his
       observations in previous talk re military budget and presented statement giving figures in
       Deptel 190.<note n="5" xml:id="d119fn5">Dated July 17. (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_SS1">S/S</gloss>-I Limdis/<gloss target="#t_Exdis1">Exdis</gloss> Microfilm,
        Reel 96)</note> (For record am submitting full text statement as made in septel.)<note n="6" xml:id="d119fn6">Dated July 21. (Ibid., Reel 97)</note> Some discussion followed with
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> trying to insist $700 million Vietnam
       appropriation was an increase. I asked him to study carefully figures and he would see that
       Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s statement to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> of December 5 was valid.<note n="7" xml:id="d119fn7">See <ref target="#d76fn6">footnote 6, Document 76</ref>.</note> During discussion he
       claimed <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Soviet systems different since funds not
       expended by end fiscal year are terminated in <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> whereas
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> funds continue available. I immediately said Secretary
        <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> was ready to appoint expert to meet either
       in Moscow or Washington to consult with Soviet expert re budgetary structure and practices,
       in order that there could be mutual understanding of each other's methods.
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> responded that if issue were connected with
       disarmament measures then need might arise to examine each other's procedures.</p>
                        <p>I then turned to questions of commercial and other bilateral relations. I pointed out
       progress in Congress on consideration of Consular Convention with hope for Civil Air
       Agreement to follow. I quoted from President's May 7 statement that he plans
       recommend measures to Congress to increase flow peaceful trade.<note n="8" xml:id="d119fn8">For text of the statement, see Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States:
         <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>, 1965, Book I, pp. 505–509.</note>
       I said bill had been drafted and is now in the White House and I hope it will soon be sent to
       Congress. I then briefly described provisions of legislation, including authority to accord
        <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> in connection with trade agreements. I added President
       had authorized review of licensing policies. I then said if legislation were attained at this
       session it would make possible have serious negotiations which we hope would lead to an
       increase in trade between us.</p>
                        <p>I stated that we quite satisfied exchanges in space and desalination and hoped that this
       kind of cooperation could be expanded. In general, I hoped we could move ahead in scientific
       and cultural exchanges in all areas, regardless of unfortunate differences on Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> replied he was grateful for what I had to say
       about status of such issues as Consular Convention, Civil Air Agreement and trade
       legislation. He said “we do want to develop cooperation and have no wish to
       restrict or limit it.” However, Vietnam issue cannot but have its reflection on
       all these matters. This is inevitable as situation “hamstrings us and you as well
       all along the line.” Soviets would like to do <pb n="313" xml:id="pg_313" facs="0341"/>all they can to broaden and expand cooperation and hope US will do everything
       possible to end conflict in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>I assured him President's efforts were in that direction. While Soviet Union not
       responsible for Vietnam, President would welcome any quiet help to bring question to
       conference table, even though not publicized and Soviets not even able to speak about it.
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> reiterated Soviets are not authorized
       negotiate re Vietnam but again stressed “Vietnamese comrades would not exclude
       political settlement, bypassing the Chinese” (pomimo kitaitsev). He advised us to
       think over and study Pham Van Dong's four points and if we wish, make
       counter-proposals to these (“think them over, turn them around, and send them to
       the North Vietnamese”). However, you will never settle the question by force, he
       said. You will only have more bloodshed and in end Vietnamese will finally liberate
       themselves from dependence on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, as people have elsewhere. It
       would be a blot on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and responsibility would inescapably lie
       on your President who by force of circumstances is responsible for all American actions. This
       would not be in his interest or in interest of American people.</p>
                        <p>I picked up his references to China and asked whether he could enlighten us further on
       Chinese attitudes towards settlement. He replied he could only repeat Vietnamese comrades do
       not rule out political settlement, but that is important, and naturally it would be on basis
       of retention 17th parallel. I asked whether he thought Peiping encouraged Hanoi to continue
       conflict. He replied, at first “Ask the Vietnamese.” Then, after
       prompting by his associates, added, “Or ask the Chinese yourselves in these talks
       you have in Warsaw, about which we know nothing.” I replied I could easily tell
       him about our talks with Chinese as they amounted to so little, and briefly described
       character of discussions.</p>
                        <p>As we were parting I thanked him for his reception and his frank talk. I stated it had
       always been my belief that with good will we could find solutions between us to difficult
       problems. To this he said he completely agreed, and added he believed that President felt
       same way. He asked me to convey his personal regards to President and state that if President
       could “extract himself from Vietnam” then he believed real progress
       could be made on the important problems between us.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s Second Conversation with
         <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>
                            </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Following are the points that seem to us most significant in Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s latest talk with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d120fn2">See <ref target="#d119">Document 119</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Much more clearly than in the first conversation,<note n="3" xml:id="d120fn3">See <ref target="#d118">Document 118</ref>.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> establishes a link between a Vietnam
       settlement and prospects for progress on other issues, including, in particular, disarmament
       and summit level talks. Despite this more explicit linkage, however, the conversation (as
       well as those with Matskevich and Rudnev) still leaves the impression of a Soviet readiness
       to proceed on bilateral issues. Indeed, in view of <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s remark that the Soviet representative at the Geneva
       disarmament talks will be empowered to act, the Soviets do not appear to rule out at least
       some substantive disarmament exchanges.</p>
                        <p>2. On Vietnam, there were three noteworthy points: first the suggestion that Hanoi would be
       ready for a settlement that Peiping did not approve; second the proposition that we make a
       counter-proposal to Pham Van Dong's four points; and third the point that a
       settlement should be based on the 17th parallel. All of these are of course in line with
       Moscow's repeated insistence that we deal with the Vietnamese directly. The last
       one gives some substance to Yugoslav assertions that Moscow is prepared to accept a divided
       Vietnam, but nowhere did <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> give any assurance of
       precisely how the Vietnamese would respond to a <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> overture.
       Kosygin's whole approach on this, including his omission of a demand for cessation
       of bombing and his abstention from any threat of greater Soviet involvement, seems intended
       to urge the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in the most persuasive way to end its
       involvement in the Vietnamese war. (With others, e.g., the British, who the Soviets judge are
       sensitive to threats, Kosygin has played a much more ominous tune.)</p>
                        <p>3. In line with the “persuasive” approach, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was remarkably warm toward President Johnson. Some
       weeks ago the Soviet leaders, privately and publicly, were becoming personally abusive of the
        <pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0343"/>President. Lately, however, this has been turned
       off in public speeches, although <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had been
       acerbic in his first conversation with Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>.</p>
                        <p>4. On disarmament, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> indicated no new
       impending Soviet initiatives, though Soviet intent to dwell on non-proliferation in terms of
       insisting that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nuclear sharing is inconsistent with it,
       was underscored. Apparently judging that on this issue a more threatening stance might be
       effective vis-á-vis the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> went further than any other Soviet leader in
       threatening nuclear sharing among Communist states.</p>
                        <p>In line, however, with his approach on Vietnam, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> seemed intent to hold out to Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> a rather glowing, if ill-defined vista of progress on disarmament
       (including even technical talks on military budget cuts), if only Vietnam went away. It was
       in this context that he threw in the prospect of a summit (with an advance assurance there
       would be no haggling over locale), which the Soviets seem to judge would appeal to us.</p>
                        <p>5. On Germany, we detect no novel substantive line, but note that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was playing on what he must judge are trends in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> thinking when he argued that our advocacy of reunification raises
       tensions.</p>
                        <p>6. We think it interesting that in both talks, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> permitted himself to make anti-Chinese remarks in franker terms than is
       the wont of top Soviet leaders in talking with us. Here again, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was no doubt hoping to encourage <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
       thinking and policy in directions favorable to Soviet interests (Tito may have made a
       persuasive pitch to the Soviets on this score when he was in Moscow recently). At the same
       time, however, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s remarks probably
       do reflect Soviet recognition that their relations with China have small prospect of
       improving.</p>
                        <p>7. Looking at the <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> visit as a whole,
       Moscow's intent seemed to be to convey the message that it was up to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to take the initiative in order to return <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations to their earlier, more hopeful course. The Soviet leaders will
       now presumably await the results of their line on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy,
       remaining free, meanwhile, to preach the cause of communist unity against the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, as currently at Bucharest, and to keep alive the specter of a
       deepening crisis by their assurances of support for Hanoi and the Front.</p>

                                <ref target="#d105">Document 105</ref>.</note> Vietnam and Soviet American Relations II.</p>
                        <p>1. In reftel's analysis we stated Soviet Govt had clearly decided apply
       “freeze” to Sov-American relations as result Vietnam, specifically:</p>
                        <p>A) To take no new initiatives themselves and to accept none from American side;</p>
                        <p>B) To allow presently arranged exchanges to continue but accept no extensions or additions;
       and</p>
                        <p>C) To avoid or at least play down, both direct negotiations with United States and
       negotiations in which two countries are main protagonists.</p>
                        <p>2. This Soviet decision has given us a rugged six months, during which Embassy's
       activities could best be described as “holding action” designed to keep
       as much as possible going, to minimize long term damage, but at same time not to compromise
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policies. Following are typical features this period:</p>
                        <p>A) Continued anti-American campaigns in press and other media, including mass meetings.</p>
                        <p>B) Attacks on Vietnam policy by Soviet leadership even at official invitational receptions
       has obliged me depart one such and avoid others.</p>
                        <p>C) Refusal to invite or permit me to speak on Soviet TV on July 4 as I did last year.</p>
                        <p>D) Foot-dragging across the board on implementation of ex-change programs, which despite
       endless prodding on our part have fallen seriously behind schedule. Architectural exhibits in
       Leningrad and Minsk got off to successful start only because we forced Soviet hand all the
       way, by such methods as sending word in advance to local authorities I would open personally
       and sending them copy <pb n="317" xml:id="pg_317" facs="0345"/>speeches I proposed to make.
       In both cases hesitations were obvious but they finally came through correctly, albeit
       reluctantly, after much checking with Moscow. In case of track meet in Kiev, in which such
       advance effort not made, I got cold-shoulder from local authorities.</p>
                        <p>3. I believe we are now seeing first steps in the implementation by the Soviet Govt of a
       harder policy toward the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. This tougher line undoubtedly
       represents Soviet Govt's considered reaction to worsening of the war in Vietnam
       and more specifically to President Johnson's July 28 decision to raise the ante
        there.<note n="3" xml:id="d121fn3">For text of the President's press conference
        on July 28 at which he announced that he was raising to 125,000 the number of U.S. forces in
        South Vietnam, see Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>, 1965, Book II, pp. 794–803.</note> It also
       marks an abrupt shift away from posture which Soviets were taking as late as seven weeks ago
       when <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, for example, was encouraging us to
       believe that Soviet Govt wished to pursue closer bilateral relations and that it was only
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> which was stopping progress.</p>
                        <p>This new line is beginning to be evident in number of ways:<note n="4" xml:id="d121fn4">See
         <ref target="#d115">Document 115</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>A) One of the most striking is Soviet decision to violate our exchange agreement by
       canceling space and hand tool reciprocal exhibits originally agreed for later this year. This
       and other evidence of new and sharply negative attitude on exchange is reported in Embtel
        503.<note n="5" xml:id="d121fn5">Dated August 18. (National Archives and Records
        Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1964–66, EDX <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>)</note> These developments
       on exchanges are, in fact, bunched together in such a way as to suggest that they result from
       single decision probably taken at end of last week to call off exchanges already contracted.
       These developments also may mean that Soviets will not be willing to enter into negotiations
       at this time about new exchange agreement on expiration of present agreement December 31,
       1965.</p>
                        <p>B) New line is also reflected—although less strikingly so—in some of
       statements now appearing in Soviet press. Given importance of President's July 28
       decision, initial Soviet reaction to it was notably restrained but a more strident note is
       now being heard in Soviet commentaries and <persName corresp="#p_SAN1">Shelepin</persName>'s speech in North Korea was very tough indeed. It will also
       be recalled that Pravda, in its authoritative foreign policy review on Aug 8, again implied
       inevitability of deterioration <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations in its reiteration of past warnings that “<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> cannot agree with approach some circles in West who hope
       coexist with Soviet Union and simultaneously pursue aggressive course toward Socialist
       countries. …” This was clear echo in public of what Kosygin had told
       Gov. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> and me in private on July 21 when he
       said:</p>
                        <p>“… Vietnam issue cannot help but have its reflection on all these
       (bilateral) <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0346"/>matters. This is inevitable as the
       situation hamstrings us, and you as well, all along the line.”<note n="6" xml:id="d121fn6">See <ref target="#d119">Document 119</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>C) There have been other recent straws in the wind such as Foreign Ministry's
       refusal to permit Pillsbury visit to Sevastopol or Yalta in reciprocity for Soviet ship visit
       already made to Honolulu, slightly tougher travel control policy, increasing difficulties
       with Soviet customs, and apparently freer hand being given KGB operations against Embassy
       (Embtels 158 and 339).<note n="7" xml:id="d121fn7">Telegram 158, July 17, reported that the
        KGB had detained and attempted to recruit a member of the Embassy staff on July 13.
        (National Archives and Records Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central
        Files 1964–66, DEF 9 <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>) Telegram 339, August 2, summarized a
        series of harassments of the Embassy. (Ibid., POL 17–6 <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>)</note> I should emphasize that some of
       these events by themselves are not particularly significant (life being what it always is in
       Moscow) and some or all may be unrelated to any top-level policy decision.</p>
                        <p>4. I still believe that Soviet Govt will find it in its own best interest to keep
       deterioration of its relations with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> within carefully
       defined limits. All evidence available to me continues to suggest that Soviet Govt is
       proceeding with great caution to avoid direct confrontation with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in Vietnam. Indeed, it may be precisely the unwillingness of Soviet Govt to
       react in kind to our military moves in Vietnam that forces it, in sense of frustration, to
       turn to exchanges and bilateral relations as only form of retaliation which still provides it
       with “self respect” of punishing us for our actions. This posture is
       all the more important to them as long as they continue to vie, as they are doing now, with
       Peking for dominance among the militant Communist groups of Asia.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, trend which I believe we are now seeing will make it progressively more
       unlikely that Soviets will allow themselves to be seen holding hands with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in public. This will probably mean, for example, the Supreme
       Soviet will not now ratify consular convention even if US Senate ratifies,<note n="8" xml:id="d121fn8">Responding to this statement by <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>, the President called Ball on August 23 and told him to tell Fulbright
        “that the cable shows it was unlikely that they would act, and in light of things
        we should let sleeping dogs lie.” Half an hour later Ball told Fulbright about
        the cable and said that he “felt for the moment we ought to let it alone; let it
        go until January and then get another reaction from Moscow.” Fulbright
        “agreed this was the best judgment.” Memoranda of the two telephone
        conversations, dated August 23, are in the Johnson Library, Ball Papers, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> II.</note> that exchanges will be whittled down to bare
       bones program, and that we can generally expect refusal of any proposal which would link
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in cooperative
       action before public eye. It will also necessarily have further negative implications for
       such multilateral issues as disarmament.</p>
                        <p>5. At same time I do not believe that we should allow sharpening of Soviet attitude to move
       us from our present policy of seeking improvement <pb n="319" xml:id="pg_319" facs="0347"/>in
        Soviet-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> relations wherever this may be possible, and to
       make it clear for all that any deterioration in our relations proceeds from their actions and
       not ours. This is certainly policy but designed to keep our relations below boiling point in
       uneasy days ahead, and will make it easier for both sides eventually to resume more favorable
       course in our relations.</p>

       possible to present publicly extent of these advantages without having undesirable
       counteraction here and I would wish there were some way of presenting these privately and
       convincingly to key Congressional opponents.</p>
                        <p>I consider the breakthrough in accomplishing a major change in the police practices
       followed by this society for forty-eight years as a <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0348"/>major gain for the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and indeed for the entire world.
       Moreover the protection provisions are of inestimably greater value to us not only because of
       the differences in our systems but because the comparative flow of persons to this country
       from the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is of an order of sixty to one. As to immunity
       provisions I think historic practices began to become obsolete when the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> combined its diplomatic and consular services in 1924. Moreover
       in view of Soviet practices this immunity has greater value for our personnel in this country
       than for their personnel in ours. While it is true that the treaty itself does not provide
       for the establishment of consulates, I would certainly anticipate that we would move as
       rapidly as possible to establish consulates after ratification. Here the order of magnitude
       of advantage is in my mind beyond calculation. The main hope of making this an easier society
       to live with is the extension of our contacts and influence on the evolution of this society
       by every means we can conceive of. What the Soviet Government will gain in our open society
       is infinitesimal in comparison. Certainly the KGB will make use of any new Soviet mission in
       the US and I can appreciate that from the point of view of his responsibility for internal
       security, the Director of the FBI evinces some concern. However, I thought the
       Secretary's testimony dealt very effectively with this question.</p>
                        <p>I cannot, of course, from here judge the mood of the Senate but do feel that rejection of
       the treaty would be serious setback. Also as I said in Embtel 524, Aug 20,<note n="4" xml:id="d122fn4">
                                <ref target="#d121">Document 121</ref>.</note> I consider it probable that Soviet side would
       defer ratification unless or until there is a change in Vietnamese situation. However,
       ratification on our part would give substance to our policy of seeking any possible
       improvement in US–USSR relations and make even more clear that any deterioration is due to
       Soviet and not American action or inaction. It seems to me that this would not only be
       consistent with but would strongly support our general posture in the Vietnamese crisis.</p>

        Soviet Union, in view of the current international situation, was canceling the Soviet space
        exhibit in the United States and the U.S. hand tools exhibit in the Soviet Union. (Ibid., SP
        8 <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>)</note> I met with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> at noon today to discuss Soviet Union's unilateral
       cancellation of space and hand tool exhibits. Recounting for him the history of our
       agreement, I noted that we had more or less made our preparations for our hand tool exhibit,
       that we had already invested about $250,000 and over 50 <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
       companies had been working with us on it. I said that we simply did not understand in light
       of foregoing the Romanovsky committee's decision to cancel exhibits because of
       “current international situation.” I noted this was violation of
       intergovernmental agreement which we regarded as very serious development. I said my
       government trusted this was a mistake which would be immediately reconsidered so that we
       could go ahead with these programs.</p>

       asked me if we wanted fulfillment of arrangements on both sides. I replied that we very much
       wanted this, but said that if Soviets for any reason wished to change character of their
       exhibit, they were of course free to do so. Delays were not unprecedented, I said, and it
       would be possible to carry out their exhibit next year if they wished.</p>

       that we all recognized that we had our political difficulties but I thought we both had a
       responsibilityto keep our programs going, and that I found it difficult to reconcile
       cancellation of these exhibits with fact that they were going ahead with plans for their
       children's creative art exhibit in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, with their
       plans to send the Moscow philharmonic to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, the film
       festival, and track meet which had just taken place, and other continuing exchanges. I said I

       that question of exhibits could not be “put away in a steel box” and

       could be done. I thanked him forthis, and said we would hope for prompt reply as we were
       continuing to invest a lot of time and money in our exhibit.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">1. Estimate of Situation</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>On August 11, 1965, the Canadians announced a sale of five million tons of wheat to Russia
       for approximately $345 million. This brought total Canadian sales to Russia this crop year to
       $415 million and for the last three crop years to $945 million (all figures expressed in U.S.
       dollars). The latest Canadian transaction was widely publicized and has generated queries
       from the Congress, the financial community, industry and farmers as to why the United States
       is not getting its share <pb n="323" xml:id="pg_323" facs="0351"/>of this business. The
       Congress is acutely aware of our balance of payments problems, and industry and banking are
       participating in our voluntary balance of payments restraint program. So it is only natural
       they should raise this question. It is equally understandable for the American wheat farmer
       to ask why he is being held back when his Canadian counterparts are being asked to increase
       their production.</p>
                        <p>The answer, of course, is very simple. The administrative regulation of the Department of
       Commerce issued at the time of the 1963–1964 sale to Russia stipulated that 50 percent of all
       wheat sales to Russia must be shipped in American bottoms. This jumps the delivered price of
       the wheat by $6 per ton (for the wheat delivered in American ships), and it is our conviction
       that short of a catastrophe the Russians will never agree to this discriminatory
       treatment.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">2. Balance of Payments Potential-Long-Range</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Estimating in this area is tricky and difficult because future U.S.S.R. wheat purchases
       depend on such variables as weather, Russian attitudes, availability of wheat in other
       countries, and the unknown factor of Russian gold reserves. However, in the judgment of those
       who have analyzed the Soviet agricultural picture most closely, there appears to be a sales
       potential for the United States in certain years of up to roughly one to two million metric
       tons. The direct U.S. balance of payments gain from such sales would be in the range of $60
       to $120 million a year. (This assumes that the Russians would buy U.S. wheat only after
       having exhausted all other sources of supply.)</p>
                        <p>3. Balance of Payments Potential-Fiscal Year 1966</p>
                        <p>For the current fiscal year there is an outside chance of a one million ton or $60 million
       sale to Russia. This estimate is based on the possibility that the U.S.S.R. may contract for
       another two to three million tons in addition to the eight million tons already under
       contract. The U.S. and France are the only nations with wheat available for export. France
       could spare up to two million tons, but if this did not fully meet Russian requirements, they
       would be forced to turn to us for anything over that amount. We think this is an outside
       chance, but it is a chance. There is a very remote chance of a two million ton sale.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">4. Budgetary Savings</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If we use the potential sales range of one or two million tons per year, the budgetary
       savings to Commodity Credit Corporation would amount to $50 to $100 million annually in
       storage, acquisition and related costs.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">5. Outlook for the American Farmer</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture's current wheat export estimate, the
       farm price of wheat may be five to ten cents per <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0352"/>bushel above the $1.25 per bushel Government support price in 1965–1966. A one to two
       million ton wheat export to the U.S.S.R. under these circumstances could increase prices
       slightly and thus raise wheat farmers' income by about $25–$50 million over the
       presently estimated level of $2.2 billion.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">6. Jobs and Freight Revenues</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Commerce Department estimates that a two million ton export of wheat to Russia would
       provide 12,300 man-months of employment.</p>
                        <p>Commerce estimates that the movement of this wheat across the country would generate $14
       million of revenues to U.S. railroads.</p>
                        <p>7. U.S.-U.S.S.R. Relations (Supplied by Under Secretary of State George W. Ball)</p>
                        <p>It would be a substantial contribution to the improvement of relations between the U.S. and
       U.S.S.R. for us to be in a position to sell on a competitive basis because it removes an
       abrasive element of discrimination.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Conclusion</p>
                        <p>(1) We recommend that it should be an Administration objective to remove by administrative
       action the current Department of Commerce regulation involving the commercial shipment of
       grain to the U.S.S.R. and the Soviet bloc with the 50 percent U.S. bottoms limitation. We
       further recommend that our target date be as soon as possible but, in no event, later than
       the next four months.</p>
                        <p>(2) There are two routes of attack in reaching the objective of eliminating the Commerce
       regulation and getting out of the commitment to organized labor:</p>
                        <p>A. You could negotiate directly with Mr. George Meany and possibly with Mr. Hall and Mr.
        Gleason.<note n="2" xml:id="d124fn2"> Paul Hall, president of the Seafarers International
        Union, and Thomas Gleason, president of the International Longshoreman's
        Association.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>B. This issue could be wrapped up in an Administration package proposal on national
       maritime policy. As you know, negotiations are proceeding on this package in the Department
       of Commerce at this time.</p>
                        <p>(3) We recommend that the Administration follow alternative B at this time for the
       following reasons:</p>
                        <p>A. There is only an outside chance of substantial wheat sales to the U.S.S.R. this
       year.</p>
                        <p>B. This issue could well be a bargaining item in the total package on which the maritime
       unions could recede without serious difficulty. (We believe that Mr. Gleason and Mr. Hall are
       fairly relaxed on this problem, but that it is a matter of concern to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MG1">Meany</persName>.)</p>
                        <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0353"/>
                        <p>(4) We ask to reserve our option to come back to you and urge your personal intervention
       with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MG1">Meany</persName> if—</p>
                        <p>A. Substantial sales of wheat (two million tons or $160 million) appear a real probability
       in the next few months.</p>
                        <p>B. No progress is made in resolving the issue within the framework of a maritime policy
       package in the next four months-the latest reading indicates that probably no progress will
       be made in this direction. (Supplied by Secretary Connor.)</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that he had been shocked at the Soviet decision to
       postpone the staging of the Soviet Achievements in Space exhibit in the U.S. and the U.S.
       Hand Tools exhibit in the U.S.S.R. He said that it was most important that we not let our
       political differences interfere with what we had going in other fields. Otherwise, it would
       be very difficult to recover lost ground.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> responded with by now familiar
       references to events in Vietnam. He asserted that Soviet public opinion would not understand
       it if the Soviet Government permitted the staging of an American musical comedy such as
       “Hello, Dolly” while at the same time American planes were bombing
       North Vietnam, a friendly country, <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0354"/>at the rate of a
       plane every few minutes. Every day, he said, the Voice of America carries news items on just
       such massive raids. To the people of the U.S.S.R., who had known massive air raids during
       World War II, these news items carried far greater significance than they did to the American
       public, which regarded them as statistics. He had just returned from a month's
       leave near Yalta where people, upon learning that he was the Soviet Ambassador in Washington,
       constantly asked him to explain U.S. actions in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> carried his argument further to
       criticize U.S. unwillingness to ratify the consular convention or to sign the civil air
       agreement. While stating that the convention in itself was not very significant, nevertheless
       he had been assured by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, he said, that
       the convention would be ratified and had so reported to his government. Now that ratification
       was put off, people in the Soviet Government were asking how there could be any agreement
       with the U.S. on important matters if the U.S. was unwilling to ratify so unimportant an
       agreement as the consular convention.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> replied that the U.S.S.R. made it
       extremely difficult for the U.S. to take such steps. Hostile propaganda attacks against the
       U.S., including attacks on the President personally,<note n="2" xml:id="d125fn2">In Research
        Memorandum <gloss target="#t_RSB1">RSB</gloss>-92, September 13, the Bureau of Intelligence
        and Research noted that personal attacks on the President by top Soviet Leaders, which had
        ceased in late June, were resumed in a speech by Brezhnev on August 27. The paper concluded
        that the reasons were obscure but suggested that the renewed attacks may have been an effort
        to reassure North Vietnam or to counter mumblings in the neutralist and socialist worlds
        that the USSR was not doing enough to aid Hanoi, or may have been an expression of Soviet
        frustration at being unable to take effective action to counter the growing U.S. involvement
        in Vietnam. (Johnson Library, National Security File, Country File, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, Vol. XI)</note> created a climate which militated against intergovernmental
       agreements.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> sought to distinguish between newspaper
       attacks and those of the government. He also asserted that if positions were reversed and the
       U.S.S.R. were bombing a country friendly to the U.S., there would not be one U.S. Government
       official who would dare to say anything good about the U.S.S.R.</p>
                        <p>When asked why the Supreme Soviet did not ratify the convention without waiting for the
       U.S. Senate to act, he said that the U.S.S.R. had its pride and would not seek a public
       rebuff, knowing that the Senate did not plan to take up the convention this year. In reply to
       Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>'s request for his opinion
       as to Soviet action if the Senate did ratify the convention at this session, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> expressed the view that there might be some deferment
       of action under present circumstances, but that the Treaty wouldbe ratified.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked me to lunch with him alone
       yesterday. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that several times the Soviet
       leaders had discussed the possibility of sending a personal message to the President but they
       had decided that since their last two communications to the President had not been answered,
       it was up to the United States to reopen this channel. Dobrynin said he thought it would be
       helpful to reopen this personal contact. I asked to whom these messages would be addressed.
       He first said he thought they might be addressed to both <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, but then said that
       if I could let him know a couple of days in advance of an actual message, he would find out
       for me how it should be addressed. He said he did not want to raise this question with Moscow
       unless there was actually going to be a message.</p>
                        <p>In the course of this discussion, he made clear to me that Brezhnev was the more important
       of the two so far as policy decision making was concerned. He also told me that while there
       would be some changesannounced at the Supreme Soviet meeting which opens on October
       first,that these changes would not be startling, and indicated that they would not affect
        <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d127fn2">In a September 3 Intelligence Note, the
        Bureau of Intelligence and Research commented on the “persistent rumors for the
        past several months of top-level changes in the Soviet hierarchy” and speculated
        that important personnel changes might be in the offing. (National Archives and Records
        Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 15–1 <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>) In a September 9 memorandum for the President's
        evening reading, Under Secretary Mann noted that there had been “a spate of
        rumors, some from Communist sources, about an impending major shake-up of the top
        leadership,” and while “such rumors are virtually impossible to
        confirm,” there were “numerous signs of fluidity and
        jockeying.” (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_SS1">S/S</gloss> Files: Lot 74 D 164)
         <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> told French Ambassador Alphand on September
        15, however, that while there would be some changes next spring if not sooner,
        “we do not expect anything big.” (Memorandum of conversation; ibid.,

                        <p>1. Thanks for sending me a copy of your account of your short discussion with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on special channel communications.<note n="2" xml:id="d128fn2">
                                <ref target="#d127">Document 127</ref>.</note> I feel an obligation to report to the
       President on this matter and to give him our current recommendations. Would it be too much
       trouble to check the record on the two communications which <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> says the President did not answer? My own recollection is that we gave
       informal replies, but I think your record will be better than mine.</p>
                        <p>2. I must say I feel that there is a certain difficulty in addressing personal
       communications to an unidentified person, but on the other hand, I think there is always a
       chance of learning something about Soviet attitudes by using this somewhat different channel.
       Could I have your views and recommendations at your convenience? This is a matter on which of
       course the President will want the Secretary's opinion before he makes a decision,
       but I think your own informal comments might be interesting to him even while the Secretary
       is in New York.<note n="3" xml:id="d128fn3">On October 4 <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> replied that he believed the communications were oral messages of
        February 1 (Document 89) and February 9 (see <ref target="#d91">Document 91</ref>). Thompson
        reported that he had discussed both these messages with Dobrynin and concluded that the
        United States had therefore informally replied to them, although not all the issues they
        raised had been commented on. He concluded his memorandum by saying:</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>“I do believe it would be useful to resume the use of this channel for
       communications between the President and the Soviet leaders but only when we have something
       specific to say which could be done better in this channel than in regular diplomatic notes
       or public statements. It may well be that the Kashmir problem will lend itself to this type
       of communication but this will depend upon how the matter develops.” (National
       Archives and Records Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Presidential

                        <p>At the Secretary's reception, I took <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> aside and asked if he knew whether or not the Soviet Government was
       likely to want to purchase wheat from us this year. He said he had not talked to their top
       people on this subject but, from his conversations with other officials, he had the
       impression that they had covered their requirements by purchases in Canada and elsewhere. I
       said that if they were likely to be interested, it would be well that they let us know
       promptly in order for us to see whether or not we could do anything about the current
       requirement that 50 percent of the shipments would have to go in American bottoms. He said he
       understood that I was mentioning this unofficially, and I confirmed that this was correct. He
       said that the 50–50 requirement had prevented them from buying from us, and said that it was
       not only a question of price, but also one of prestige. He said that he would inquire of his
       Government and let me know what the current position was.</p>

                        <p>McGB:</p>
                        <p>In response to your query on the status of Soviet Jews,<note n="2" xml:id="d130fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName>'s query followed a meeting that he
        and President's Special Counsel Lee White had at the White House on September 20
        with a delegation pleading for Soviet Jews. The President met very briefly with the group.
        (Ibid., President's Daily Diary) Other documentation generated in connection with
        the meeting includes a September 22 <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> report on
        “The Current Position of Jews in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>” and a State Department report on the “Policy of the
        United States Concerning the Situation of Soviet Jews” that Benjamin Read
        forwarded to <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> on September 27. (Both ibid.,
        National Security File, Komer Files, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, November
        1963–March 1966)</note> State and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> intelligence confirms
       that the post-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> leaders have relaxed a few
       minor restrictions. But there's no ground for expecting a big breakthrough. Though
       the recent concessions are probably mostly window-dressing they may make Jewish life a whit
       easier. They don't change the Communist purpose of forcing Jews to forget their
       heritage and assimilate, but the fact that they've been made at all suggests the
       climate may improve, at least for a time.</p>
                        <p>Concessions this year simply allow bakeries in some cities to make matzoh for Passover,
       printing a few secular and prayer books and a monthly magazine in Yiddish and reopening a
       religious school in Moscow. (<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had clamped
       down on all these in 1962–63.) Also, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> has
       spoken out against anti-Semitism, but mainly in the context of debate over economics and
       policy toward intellectuals (Jews are leading liberals in both fields).</p>
                        <p>However, the basic restrictions on all nationality groups and religious sects go on,
       applied a bit more harshly to Jews than to others (e.g. they're the only national
       minority without their own schools). Survival of Jewish practices depends on the local
       synagogue; there are no nationwide religious or cultural institutions such as other sects
       have to promote cohesion and pass on the heritage.</p>
                        <p>It looks as if world opinion may have helped prod Soviet leaders into making these
       concessions. For instance, we attribute relaxation of the matzoh restrictions to the
       worldwide press furor in 1964. In fact, we probably have to read most of concessions chiefly
       as image-polishing. Radio Moscow's international service in English played up <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0360"/>the concessions but the domestic official press made no
       official announcement.</p>
                        <p>But we've hit a stone wall on all official approaches. The Soviets flatly refuse
       to deal with the issue on grounds it's their own business, though this
       needn't keep us from hitting them again if the time seems riper. <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> is the one official channel open to us, and it consistently
       gives straight news coverage to such events as the Washington vigil<note n="3" xml:id="d130fn3">The Eternal Light Vigil for Soviet Jewry at Lafayette Park across from the
        White House, September 19, 1965. The President's message to the participants is
        included in a report on “Presidential Statements on Soviet Jews” that
        Saunders forwarded to <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> on September 20.
        (Ibid.)</note> (4 spots in Russian-language broadcasts). But even <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> nervously walks the line between getting our story across and provoking jamming
       or jeopardizing its general respectability among Russian listeners. Radio Moscow and Tass
       responses to the vigil showed Moscow is touchy and would like to scare us off. (Radio Moscow:
       “The White House has again publicly dealt a crippling blow to its much advertised
       idea of building bridges to the Soviet Union.”)</p>
                        <p>So the best bet is to plug away in quasi-official ways. Receiving Jewish groups here and
       sending Presidential messages to them annoys Moscow, but we don't see any evidence
       that this kind of thing causes these Soviet leaders to crack down all the harder on their
       Jews (as we feared with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>). We'll
       push the issue in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> committees (Committee III is considering
       a convention on eliminating racial discrimination) and in the Commission on Human Rights
       (eliminating religious discrimination). The embassy can help informally by trying to
       straighten out specific problems, like arranging matzoh shipments (another form of pressure).
       The Senate may pass a resolution condemning Soviet restrictions.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, we're pretty much on our own. We have no evidence that the
       Moslems or Buddhists are worried enough about their brethren in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to do anything, so there's not much chance for kicking up a wider
       storm. The Baptists, Jehovah's Witnesses and Seventh Day Adventists here are
       concerned about their people too, but they just add a small local voice.</p>
                        <p>This approach won't satisfy the Jewish groups; their public comments on
       State's policy are caustic. On the other hand, it's the only one that
       holds out hope for even limited results. We also have to balance our connivance in these
       limited pressures against our larger Soviet interests. So the range of debate is really over
       how actively State pushes versus how much it follows. The initiative so far has come from the
       Jewish groups, and they don't miss many openings. State has clearly <pb n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0361"/>decided it shouldn't lead on this one but will lend
       a hand to private efforts. Given our limited ability to achieve anything officially and our
       other priorities, the balance seems about right. Our alternative is to tell State to seek out
       opportunities to needle Moscow unofficially, but I question whether we want to go that far.
       [1 line of source text not declassified] Radio Liberty Committee and Radio Free Europe also
       help. But we can't say much about those.</p>

       line in late 1964. In December of 1964, however, the Soviet Foreign Ministry claimed that a
       leased-line was not possible due to a shortage of available facilities. The Foreign Ministry
       offered us Telex service instead. While Telex would not be a facility available for our
       exclusive use, it would be an improvement over present arrangements. After exhaustive efforts
       to obtain the leased line, we informed the Foreign Ministry on September 9 of this year that
        <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0362"/>a Telex would be acceptable, but reiterated the
       hope that a leased line could be established as soon as possible. We are according the Soviet
       Embassy in Washington Telex service on a reciprocal basis. Technical arrangements for
       beginning service have almost been completed and service for our Embassy and the Soviet
       Embassy will begin simultaneously.</p>

                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s conversations leave the
       impression that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is not ready either to increase
       tensions or take steps to ease them. Moscow seems to want to buy itself a little time to see
       what directions events take and sort out its interests and objectives.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s business-as-usual tone in
       his annual tour d'horizon suggests that Moscow is less willing to see a further
       deterioration in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations over Vietnam than
       Brezhnev implied in his September <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0363"/>29 speech.<note n="3" xml:id="d132fn3">For text of Brezhnev's September 29 comments on
        U.S.-Soviet relations and Vietnam, see <hi rend="italic">Current Digest of the Soviet
         Press,</hi> October 20, 1965, p. 8.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> does not, of course, reverse policy views
       enunciated by <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>, but he makes it clear that
       both in private talks with American leaders and on certain policy matters of interest to it,
       Moscow is unwilling to take nearly so hard a line as it does in public statements chiefly
       addressed to communists at home and abroad.</p>
                        <p>3. The Soviets presumably see their relations with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> as
       their principal source of leverage in efforts to restrain American actions in Southeast Asia.
       If so, they may be cautious about using up their diplomatic capital too quickly. At the same
       time, Moscow may wish to use continuing contacts with the US to convey a warning to Hanoi and
       Peking that the Soviet Union's global interests impose limits on how far the USSR
       can be cajoled into supporting Asian communist intransigence.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s continuing interest in the
       topic of military budgets and his restraint in not renewing reproaches that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had reneged on an understanding about them suggests that the
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> hopes to weather the Vietnam crisis without
       substantial increases in military spending which might upset its domestic economic
       calculations.</p>
                        <p>5. Hence, to a remarkable degree <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> (unlike
       Kosygin in his talks with Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>),<note n="4" xml:id="d132fn4">
                                <ref target="#d118">See Documents 118</ref> and <ref target="#d119">119</ref>.</note>
       avoided explicitly linking Vietnam to other issues. He agreed to start negotiations on a new
       cultural agreement (these may prove to be difficult), and on the less controversial aspects
       of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Soviet draft treaties on nonproliferation, but
       he gave no hint of any Soviet change on the issue of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
       nuclear arrangements, and there is a danger that he may have misread the conversations as
       indicating that a <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> shift is in the offing.</p>
                        <p>6. In keeping with his generally restrained approach, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> did not air current Soviet views on support for national liberation
       movements. But he was not responsive to hints that coincidence of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet interests in the India-Pakistan situation might extend to the third world
       generally. On the contrary he drew a distinction between partial measures, which he favored,
       and regional approaches to disarmament, about which he was skeptical. Moscow's
       efforts to use the issue of American imperialism as a rallying point for communists and the
       nonaligned, as well as specific differences in particular areas, remains a major barrier to
       cooperation in third areas despite <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s mildness of manner.</p>
                        <p>7. Reading <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> against the background of other
       Soviet moves and statements, we foresee no change in the orientation in Soviet <pb n="336" xml:id="pg_336" facs="0364"/>foreign policy. While some increased sharpness toward Communist
       China seems to be creeping into Soviet pronouncements, Moscow apparently intends to maintain
       a public posture of hostility toward <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policies in Vietnam
       and elsewhere. But public hostility toward the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> will be
       tempered by restraint in what the Soviets actually do about it, and relieved by a modicum of
       cordiality in such private talks as Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s in Moscow and the Secretary's in New York and by
       a degree of cooperativeness on some specific issues.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>A year after the fall of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> it is still
       difficult to define the character of the new regime in Moscow. The new leaders'
       internal policy has been directed in large part toward rectifying <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s mistakes in economic organization and administration.
       They have initiated an economic reform program which has a strong liberal cast, while in
       other matters a more orthodox hard line seems to be emerging.</p>
                        <p>In foreign policy too there has been some ambivalence. Party Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> and Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> have reaffirmed the major changes in post-Stalin policy. At the same
       time they have adopted new tactics in dealing with the challenge from China, tactics which
       have improved the Soviet position in the Communist world but have led to involvements in a
       war over which Moscow has little control. As a result, Soviet freedom of action on other
       East-West issues has become narrowly limited.</p>
                        <p>A clearer picture may emerge at the 23rd Party Congress in March. Collective leadership
       seems to be functioning effectively, but <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s power is growing. Political maneuvering should be
       stimulated by approach of the congress, and the need to present a new five-year economic
       plan, thereby outlining the regime's priorities, could lead to political
       trouble.</p>
                        <p>1. Following the fall of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in October 1964,
       the new Soviet leaders hastened to guarantee the continuity of Soviet domestic and foreign
       policy. Their promise has been kept in the sense that there has been no fundamental reversal
       of post-Stalin policy. However, differences in approach and shifts in emphasis have
       accumulated, many of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s major
       programs have been undone, and the new leaders have left their own imprint on almost every
       field of policy. Their foreign policy decisions have resulted in significant changes in the
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s international position and their domestic
       proposals could, if implemented, produce important transformations in Soviet society.</p>
                        <p>[Here follow sections on “The Top Leadership” and
       “Domestic Policies.”]</p>
                        <p>
                            <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0366"/>
                            <hi rend="italic">Foreign Policy</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>13. The extensive changes in internal policies make it clear, in retrospect, that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was probably overthrown in order to rectify his past
       blunders and to head off whatever further internal changes he had in mind last fall. From the
       vantage point of the present, it also appears that the new leaders considered <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s tactics in meeting the Chinese
       challenge to be self-defeating. At the outset it was apparent that they had no intention of
       forcing the issue with Peking, or of continuing to wage the conflict of Peking's
       rules, i.e., through an exchange of vociferous polemics. Beyond this, it became evident that
       they would try to reassert their influence in the Communist world, even at the expense of
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s détente with the
       West.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Vietnam</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>14. This change occurred last winter, before <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
       visited Hanoi and the Pleiku incident. It is still not clear how the Soviets estimated the
       outcome of the Vietnamese war at that time. Perhaps they saw a cheap opportunity to gain some
       credit for the successful conclusion of the war, with no great risk. In any event, once
       committed to winning over the Vietnamese and North Koreans, the Soviets have had little
       choice but to become increasingly involved. Thus, the Vietnamese war and its repercussions
       for Sino-Soviet relations have become pivotal issues in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s foreign policy, setting fairly narrow limits on its freedom of
       action in other East-West issues.</p>
                        <p>15. This attempt to regain the initiative within the Communist movement has been a moderate
       success. There is no doubt that the Soviets have made gains in Hanoi and Pyongyang. But the
       strong Chinese challenge continues to do damage to the Soviet position and the Vietnamese war
       has added one more acute issue driving the Soviets and Chinese apart. Moreover, the Soviets
       are in the unenviable position of being unable to advance in Vietnam without higher risks or
       to retreat without great loss of prestige. To be sure, the Soviets can carefully control the
       scope of their own involvement and the extent of their commitment, and for this reason the
       Soviet leaders probably regard gains in the Communist world worth the potential risk of a
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet confrontation. Nevertheless, the Soviets are
       involved in a war over which they have only limited control, and the initiative remains
       largely in the hands of Hanoi, and to some extent with China and the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>16. The obvious way out for Moscow is a negotiated settlement. From the very beginning of
       their involvement, the Soviets have proposed this course to the other Communist powers. This
       attitude has led to constant Chinese accusations of seeking to sacrifice the Vietnamese on
       the altar of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet détente. At the same time
       the Chinese have effectively blocked Soviet attempts to promote a common <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339" facs="0367"/>Communist policy. In the face of this impasse, the Soviets will
       probably have to continue their present efforts: supplying military aid, playing down their
       own involvement, and seeking opportunities to urge the US and North Vietnamese to
       negotiate.</p>
                        <p>17. If the Soviets have now settled down for a long haul, they may have also decided to try
       to limit some of the damage to Soviet-American relations. Some recent gestures suggest this.
       For example, the talks between Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and
        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> were held in a relaxed atmosphere, free of
       recriminations over Vietnam. After sitting quiescent through the Geneva disarmament talks,
       the Soviets now seem to have decided to make a more active effort so as not to foreclose the
       possibility of an agreement in nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. On the other hand, the
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet cultural exchange negotiations are in doubt. On a
       number of other issues the Soviets have no choice but to mark time or substitute propaganda
       for policy. Thus the Soviets will probably maintain the current
       “freeze” in relations with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, as
       long as their new line in Vietnam seems to be paying dividends within the Communist
       world.</p>
                        <p>[Here follow sections on Soviet foreign policy in other areas of the world.]</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">The Outlook</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>42. Although the leadership has survived a year intact and has been able to make decisions
       on important issues, it is still too early for any firm predictions for the future either of
       this leadership or of general Soviet policies. A clearer picture should emerge at the Party
       Congress in March. The surprising degree of harmony displayed by the present leadership has
       been in marked contrast to the immediate and obvious struggle for power which began after
       Stalin's death. In advance of the party congress, however, political maneuvering
       will probably intensify. Such maneuvering is likely to be aggravated not only by the
       important economic choices [of] the leaders, but also by the other questions such as the
       proper historical and political perspective of Stalinism, or de-Khrushchevization, both of
       which can become important divisive issues. Finally, the leadership is likely to want to
       redefine foreign policy in an authoritative way at the congress, and this means that the
       Sino-Soviet question must be treated. Congresses have historically marked crucial turning
       points in Soviet history, and the 23rd Congress is likely to be a watershed for the new
       regime.</p>

                            <item>
                                <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Llewellyn E. Thompson</persName>, Ambassador-at-Large,

                        <p>The Ambassador called at his own request and made the following oral statement:</p>
                        <p>“Moscow has noted the publication in a number of American newspapers of the
       so-called ‘Penkovsky Papers’ and a report that these
       ‘Papers’ are going to be published soon in the USA and in England in
       the form of a book. Familiarization with the contents of these ‘Papers’
       leaves no doubt that they are a crude forgery concocted in the spirit of the worst time of
       the ‘cold war.’ There is attributed to Penkovsky a whole collection of
       stereotyped, slanderous fabrications about the Soviet Union, its policy and Soviet
       leaders.</p>
                        <p>“The authors of this forgery do not even stop before such a monstrous lie as
       attributing to Soviet leaders the idea of preventive war which has actually been propagated,
       as is known, by certain circles in the West.</p>
                        <p>“At the same time when one becomes acquainted with the contents of the
       ‘Penkovsky Papers’ it becomes completely clear that they are not simply
       the product of the imagination of some irresponsible journalist. American and English
       intelligence services whose agent Penkovsky was, as proved in the course of the trial against
       him in May 1963, lent their efforts to the fabrication of this forgery and to this entire
       provocational scheme.</p>
                        <p>“In this connection the publication in the USA of the above-mentioned forgery
       and intention to publish it as a book cannot be viewed by us other than premeditated action
       which is in direct contradiction of repeated pronouncements by representatives of the
       Government of the USA about striving for improvements in Soviet-American relations. The
       responsibility for the negative consequences of this <pb n="341" xml:id="pg_341" facs="0369"/>action for Soviet-American relations, the state of which at present, even without this,
       leaves much to be desired, will rest on the American side.”</p>
                        <p>I said I would make no official comment until there had been an opportunity to examine his
       statement. I said, however, I could tell him on a personal basis and off the record, that
       when the publication of this series was announced, I inquired of our people and was told that
       we had nothing to do with the publication of this series. I said I understood that the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> was asked whether they had any objection to publication and
       that they had replied that they had considered the matter solely from the security point of
       view and from this point of view, had no objection to publication.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then asked if he could expect an official reply, and I said I presumed that
       he could.</p>

                        <p>The President received me shortly before 12:30 and I remained with him for approximately
       one hour and a quarter.<note n="2" xml:id="d136fn2">

                        <p>The President then read briefing memoranda drafted by Mr. Francis Bator of the White House

        President's meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. (Johnson

        78</ref>.</note> I said that I was sure that the posture of continued interest in
       improvement <pb n="342" xml:id="pg_342" facs="0370"/>in our relations with the Soviets had
       been the correct one during the past year. I had been sorry, however, that it had been
       necessary to postpone specific actions, such as ratification of the Consular Convention,
       implementation of the Civil Air Agreement and the East-West trade legislation which would
       provide a basis for trade talks with the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that the climate had been made more difficult for progress on such
       matters by Soviet anti-American statements, which extended to personal attacks on the
       President and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. I said I realized
       this and understood his difficulties in this connection. However, as he knew, Secretary
        <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> in Washington and I in Moscow had made
       observations to the Soviets on this score and I felt there had been a diminution of the
       violence of the attacks during recent months. As to the specific measures on which I had
       suggested we should go forward, I of course bowed to his judgment as to political
       possibilities. However, in my view, all three of these items were more in the national
       interest than that of the Soviet Union. I stated my reasons in connection with each item
       along lines set forth in Moscow Embassy telegrams. With regard specifically to the Consular
       Convention prospect, I reported on my conversation with Admiral Raborn <note n="5" xml:id="d136fn5">No record of this conversation with Director of Central Intelligence Raborn
        has been found.</note> regarding his exchanges with <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss>
       Director Hoover and subsequent talks with key Senators and said that some of those Senators
       who had opposed in the past would go along with ratification in the new session of
       Congress.</p>
                        <p>The President observed that the cancellation of the “Hello Dolly”
       show under the exchanges agreement had again raised the question of Soviet violation of their
       international agreements. I explained that following my intervention with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                            <note n="6" xml:id="d136fn6">
                                <ref target="#d123">See Document 123</ref>.</note> the Soviets had tried to escape the
       charge of violating an agreement by labelling their actions postponement rather than a
       cancellation of the “Hello Dolly” show. I went on to say that I had
       always believed that agreements with the Soviet Union had to be self-enforcing. I then set
       forth my reasons for believing that in the projected agreements I previously cited this would
       be the case. While I considered that the preponderant advantages were on our side because of
       the differing natures of the two societies and our objective of opening up the closed Soviet
       society, I expressed the view that the Soviet interest was important enough in these cases to
       impel them to observe the agreements.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked my views with respect to Soviet relations with the Chinese
       Communists and Vietnam. I replied along the lines <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0371"/>of
       Moscow Embassy analyses and of my response to similar questions from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, including the latter's inquiry relating
       to the effect of a possible suspension of bombing. In this connection he asked about the
       Severeid allegations attributing to <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Adlai Stevenson</persName>
       the claim that the Soviets had informed U Thant last year Hanoi was ready to talk settlement.
       I said I had had no knowledge of this myself and no confirmation from Soviet sources. I
       commented, however, that—as I had just said in analyzing the policy of the new
       Soviet leadership—this approach would have come at the precise time when the
       Kremlin was convinced our politico-military base in South Vietnam was collapsing under us and
       thought it was only a matter of ushering us out.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired about the prospect of wheat sales to the Russians. I expressed the
       view that they would not purchase wheat this year but would seek to satisfy their needs from
       other sources, notably Canada, Australia, Argentina or France or, if necessary, by reneging
       on their outside commitments and letting other Eastern European countries turn to us instead.
       The President expressed full appreciation of the political and psychological factors involved
       and thought steps should be taken to stop misleading agitation of this question in the U.S.
       He told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BF1">Bator</persName> to ask Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> to take action along these lines.</p>
                        <p>The President reverted to the question of the new exchanges agreement. I gave him a
       run-down on the present situation, the prospect of negotiations in January, and the
       importance of the program to our objective of breaking down the closed Soviet society.</p>
                        <p>During a walk in the garden the President asked me many questions with respect to Soviet
       economic problems and the status of the leadership to which I replied along the lines of
       Embassy reporting on these subjects. He also asked me what I thought Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName>'s group would get in Moscow. I said I
       thought they would hear the same phonograph record I had been listening to for the last 10
       months. The President commented, that is, no business until Vietnam is over? I replied
       “Yes”.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion the President said he was proud of the job that we were doing in Moscow. I
       replied that it was a privilege to work for him.</p>

                        <p>At his invitation I lunched with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
       today, staying at the Embassy from 1:45 p.m. (having been delayed one-half hour by my talk
       with the President at the White House)<note n="2" xml:id="d137fn2">
                                <ref target="#d136">See Document 136</ref>.</note> until nearly 4:00 p.m., when <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had an appointment at the Department. After general
       initial conversation, including apologies for my tardiness and reference to my leave in
       Florida and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s trip to Cuba
       with Soviet Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, the Ambassador
       inquired about the President's health and views on Soviet-American relations. I
       said I was glad to inform him that the President had made friendly references to him
       personally. However, the President continued to be disturbed by the hostile nature of Soviet
       statements about the U.S. including unfriendly references to him personally. The President
       had never been a communist-baiter and would continue to wish that there were some way to make
       some progress in our relationship. However, the sustained nature of this hostility had
       created an atmosphere, especially among members of Congress, which made forward movement
       difficult.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> interrupted to say that he did not know of
       personal attacks on the President by members of the Soviet leadership and he was particularly
       certain that none had been made since his conversation with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                            <note n="3" xml:id="d137fn3">
                                <ref target="#d114">See Document 114</ref>.</note> and his reports on this subject when he
       was back in Moscow on vacation this summer. I said that except for one reference which I
       recalled in a <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> speech which mentioned the
       President by name and which was not exactly friendly, I agreed that it was true that personal
       references had not been made by members of the leadership. However, such statements did
       appear in the Soviet press and Soviet propaganda. The effect was about the same since these
       newspapers were officially controlled in the Soviet Union and the headlines appearing in
       American newspapers did not make any fine distinctions <pb n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0373"/>as to the Soviet source. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> argued
       that the Soviet press was not under the strict control that it used to be; since there were
       no official Soviet statements hostile to the President, the remarks cited by me could only be
       Soviet press reporting of articles or statements from foreign sources. I repeated that, be
       this as it might, such fine distinctions were not made by the reporters and the result was
       the creation of a difficult atmosphere here.</p>
                        <p>The conversation then turned to a general discussion of Vietnam and Germany with particular
       reference to nuclear sharing with the Germans along familiar lines with nothing essentially
       new being said on either side.</p>
                        <p>Later <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> reverted to bilateral relations
       saying he hoped we could find some new ideas or proposals to move things forward. I replied
       that we would like to do this but that Soviet statements about the impossibility of any
       progress in our relationship so long as “American aggression continued in
       Vietnam” not only contributed to a worsening of the atmosphere but created the
       impression that we were in fact up against a brick wall with respect to any new moves.
       Practically every Soviet leader from <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> to
       Polyansky made such statements in every public speech touching on international relations. I
       thought the Soviets had made clear that they would not be receptive to new proposals until
       Vietnam was settled but I did not see why they had to keep repeating this all the time,
       especially every time they were jumped on by the Chinese. Indeed, this process was creating
       increasing difficulty for the President even in connection with moving ahead on such
       presently pending matters as the ratification of the Consular Convention and conclusion of
       the Civil Air Agreement as well as East-West trade legislation. Moreover, I thought the
       Soviets had made a great mistake in canceling “Hello Dolly”
       performances in Moscow since this had raised again the charge that the Soviets could not be
       depended upon to respect any agreements that were made with them. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> immediately replied that this was not a cancellation of a performing
       arts attraction but only a postponement. I replied that it had only become a postponement
       after I had gone to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and pointed out that
       the original cancellation was a direct violation of an inter-governmental agreement. The
       Ambassador did not try to respond to my observation about the incessant repetition of the
       Soviet line on our bilateral relations. He did, however, expand on the question of the
       ratification of the Consular Convention. He said this was not regarded as an important matter
       from a substantive point of view but that failure of ratification had been regarded as an
       indication of American intentions to freeze our relationship. He recounted at some length his
       experience on returning to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for leave last summer,
       when on the basis of assurances from Secretary Rusk he tried to convince Moscow skeptics <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346" facs="0374"/>that the U.S would ratify the Consular Convention. By
       the time he returned to Moscow from leave in the Crimea he had been proven wrong. He went on
       to say that he supposed that since the agreement had not been ratified in the last session of
       Congress it would not be in the new session. I replied that this might depend to a
       considerable extent on Moscow. I thought it would be useful if the Soviet side would pipe
       down on its attacks and charges and try to improve the atmosphere before the new session of
       Congress convenes. Dobrynin said it might be useful if I made some of the observations in
       Moscow I had just made to him today. I said I intended to do so; I usually had a talk with
       Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> after my return to Moscow
       from the United States and would expect to do the same this time.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I reverted to the question of the “postponement” of
       “Hello Dolly” and pointed out that we had not, as we might have, in
       reciprocity “postponed” the visit of the Moscow Philharmonic. They
       should take note of this and realize that they were already in our debt for one major
       performing arts attraction.</p>

                        <p>I made the following oral statement to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>:</p>
                        <p>“With reference to your statement to me on November fifteenth<note n="2" xml:id="d138fn2">
                                <ref target="#d135">Document 135</ref>.</note> with regard to the ‘Penkovsky
       Papers,’ The United States Government was not responsible for their publication.
       As the Ambassador is aware, our newspapers and publishing houses are free to print what they
       please. The responsibility is theirs and theirs alone.</p>
                        <pb n="347" xml:id="pg_347" facs="0375"/>
                        <p>“In view of this, no comment on your other statements is necessary. I should
       like, however, to reject in particular the charge that the publication of the
       ‘Penkovsky Papers’ is a ‘premeditated action in direct
       contradiction of repeated pronouncements by the Government of the USA about striving for
       improvement of Soviet-American relations.’ There can be no question about the
       sincerity of the statements by the President, the Secretary of State and others expressing
       their hope for improved relations with the Soviet Union. We will continue to do what we can
       to further this objective, but obviously this is a two-way street and progress depends not on
       us alone.”</p>
                        <p>He said he would, of course, inform his Government, but then he commented saying he was
       speaking personally. He said: “Of course you understand, and I understand,
       somebody in an American agency was responsible for writing these papers.” He noted
       that my statement referred to the President and the Secretary of State and said that he had
       not suggested that this had been done at the top levels of the American Government.</p>
                        <p>I said I could only repeat what I had told him before, which was that I had checked with
       the CIA which had denied any involvement. The Ambassador again indicated, as in his original
       oral statement, that the accusation that the Soviets had considered preventive war had
       particularly disturbed his Government.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>In the year since the ouster of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> the
       Soviet leadership has endeavored to project an image of collectivity and has claimed to be
       approaching the considerable Soviet domestic and foreign problems inherited from <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in a more reasonable and careful manner. The style
       of <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> has been more deliberate and less flamboyant than <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s. Their collective approach has
       necessarily reduced the popular appeal of their moves as compared to his. Moreover, the
       removal of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has removed none of the
       dilemmas, divisive issues, and chronic domestic problems which confronted the regime under
       his leadership. The present leaders are thus under constraint to adjust their differences
       within the framework of collegiality as long as possible, but it does not seem that the
        post-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> collective leadership is more likely
       to remain a permanent feature of Soviet politics than was the first post-Stalin junta.</p>
                        <p>In domestic affairs, the new leaders have defined perhaps more carefully than any of their
       predecessors some of the more serious problems, and have taken some policy initiatives that
       have at least set the broad framework for dealing with several of these problems. The
       agricultural measures adopted at the Central Committee plenum last March should prove
       beneficial over the long run; those in the sphere of industrial management and planning
       adopted at the September plenum may well produce at least short-run deleterious effects, as
       they have already led to confusion and indecision. The economic reforms, if fully
       implemented, would represent a significant policy departure, but in their present form they
       lag behind the proposals of the more “liberal” Soviet economists and
       the reforms introduced recently in a number of East European countries. A major drawback of
       the projected reforms is that they connote postponing until 1967–68 the introduction of the
       revised, presumably more rational system of wholesale prices. One crucial question for the
       success of the reforms is whether the industrial managers, long accustomed to a
       “command system,” will avail themselves of the opportunities to
       exercise initiative constructively.</p>
                        <p>There were signs of top-level disagreement over the extent and timing of the economic
       reforms and governmental restructuring right up to the eve of the September plenum. Behind
       these differences loomed the perennial debate over allocation of resources and over
       priorities for the next Five-Year Plan. Differences have also been evident <pb n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0377"/>in other key areas: in defining the Party's role
       towards the government and the economy; in setting stricter limitations on Party membership
       and revising rules on rotation of personnel in leading Party organs; and in determining how,
       and at what pace, to carry out re-evaluation of the Stalin period.</p>
                        <p>In foreign affairs, the programmatic underpinnings of Soviet policy shifted soon after
        <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> took over in 1964, and for the ensuing year Moscow emphasized bloc unity
       as a stated policy goal. By so doing, the Soviets evidently hoped to regroup their forces in
       the international communist movement and to put the onus for any further polemics on the
       Chinese. In this context they tried to build up a call for joint action in Vietnam both as a
       rallying slogan for communists and their sympathizers throughout the world and as a device
       for embarrassing the Chinese. Moscow seemed willing to pursue this policy even at the risk of
       serious deterioration in its relations with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, but the
       Soviets remained circumspect in avoiding direct <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> military confrontation over Vietnam, and in the end there
       appeared to be no intention to change the basic relationship with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> that might be labeled limited hostility. By the end of their first year in
       office, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s successors had made no
       remarkable breakthroughs. To the extent that they have proven their point that the Chinese
       were to blame for continued disunity in the communist world, they have but demonstrated their
       lack of defined purpose to choose an alternative follow-up policy. In the third world, the
       Soviets have encountered some knotty dilemmas in the face of international and internecine
       conflicts, but on the whole their flexible policy has brought them some slight gain in favor,
       illustrated by their experience with the abortive Bandung II episode.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">A. General Guidelines</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Although the post-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> regime attempted some
       initiatives during the year and responded to various crisis situations, its policy now seems
       to be hung up on the interplay of a number of conflicting pressures. This impression was
       confirmed by <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s comments on the
       state of Soviet foreign policy included in his speech to the September plenum. Despite
        <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s efforts to characterize Soviet
       diplomacy as “active” and “advancing,” the net
       impression is that Moscow has at least as many problems and fewer solutions than it had a
       year ago. When he failed to point to any new directions on the major issues of China and
       particularly the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> perhaps inadvertently drew <pb n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0378"/>a
       starkly pessimistic picture that would be depressing to a large part of the Soviet public,
       which tends to look on good Soviet-US relations as a harbinger of a happier state of affairs
       for themselves.</p>
                        <p>The likelihood also exists that <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s remarks reflect an increased preoccupation of the regime
       with domestic matters. Beginning with Presidium member Kirilenko's statement in
       the Far East in July, a series of authoritative comments on Soviet foreign policy, including
       articles in Kommunist and Pravda, and most recently <persName corresp="#p_SMA1">Suslov</persName>'s speech to the Seventh Comintern Congress commemoration,
       have, in roughly similar language, stressed that the first or “supreme
       revolutionary principle” of Soviet foreign policy is the “building of
       communism” at home. While this statement also has connotations for the running
       polemic with the Chinese Communists on the proper revolutionary tactic in the international
       field, the way it has been emphasized in recent months, and particularly accompanied by
       reference to the CC <gloss target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss> plenums of the past year, all of
       which were primarily concerned with domestic matters, suggests that the regime at least for
       the moment is focusing inward.</p>
                        <p>The programmatic underpinnings of Soviet foreign policy shifted soon after the accession of
       the <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> regime in 1964 and continued to point during the year in the direction
       of greater concern with problems of bloc unity and leadership even at the risk of a serious
       deterioration of US-Soviet ties. The formula used was first enunciated by <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> in November 1964. It included six aims or tasks,
       involving the fostering of (1) peaceful conditions for socialist construction, (2) socialist
       unity, (3) national liberation, (4) cooperation with independent Afro-Asian and Latin
       American states, (5) peaceful coexistence with capitalist states, and (6) deliverance from
       world war. Although these six points basically follow the tenets of the <gloss target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss> Program issued in 1961, peaceful coexistence was no longer
       the umbrella under which all other tasks are to be carried out but became one of the six
       distinct, though interrelated, priorities of Soviet foreign policy and placed near the end of
       the list. Slight deviations from the six-point formula have appeared during the year, and
       although the formula is not necessarily included in every authoritative foreign policy
       statement, it has been reiterated recently and remains a useful template against which future
       policy statements can be measured.</p>
                        <p>Despite Brezhnev's somewhat negative picture of Soviet policy, recent
       developments suggest some movement in certain areas. There have been hints that the Soviet
       regime may be shifting its tactics vis-á-vis Communist China in the direction of
       more forthright hostility and possibly a more overt move to isolate the Chinese. This
       likelihood has been accelerated by the Indo-Pakistan crisis as well as the Indonesian
       internal crisis but was already apparent in late summer. At the same <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0379"/>time, the Soviet regime in the last half year has increasingly
       resorted to a “soft-sell” approach in an effort to improve relations
       with countries on its southern borders-i.e., Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan and Pakistan. The
       “soft-sell” also has emerged in relations with the Scandinavian and
       other Western powers and seems a coefficient of recent Soviet moves to reemphasize
       popular-front movements, both in Western Europe and Latin America, and to cooperate with
       “revolutionary” democrats in Africa and Asia.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The hardening of the Soviet demeanor toward the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> continues
       to be limited and apparently intended more as a tactic than a fundamental reorientation of
       policy. Brezhnev in his plenum speech chose to make <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet
       relations depend upon the course of events in Vietnam, although he seemed to be at a loss to
       foresee how the Vietnam crisis might be resolved. He stated that these relations have been
       “considerably complicated” by the Vietnam crisis and have a
       “clear tendency toward freezing,” although he gave no indication
       whether or in what way they would worsen.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> did not, however, repeat his August 27
       criticism of the President, nor have other authoritative Soviet statements since then
       criticized the President. Developments since the end of August, when it seemed possible that
       the <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> criticism would open a harsher phase in
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations, reveal both positive and negative moves
       vis-á-vis the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. These moves to some extent cancel
       out each other and leave the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> roughly on its previous
       course of carefully limited hostility toward the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in
       bilateral state relations. While the cultural aspects of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet exchange program have bogged down further, the scientific and educational
       exchanges continue to limp along. This behavior contrasts to the outpourings of Soviet
       propaganda media which have steadily increased the anti-imperialist emphasis concentrating on
       the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> as the main culprit responsible for exacerbating
       international tension.</p>

                        <p>Neither of the Soviet leaders covered new ground or deviated markedly from previous Soviet
       positions on the topics discussed. On the other hand, in some important instances the
       statements of Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> and others of his
       colleagues do not conform with generally understood Administration policy. While the Senators
       said that they were giving their opinions and those of their Congressional colleagues,
       Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> stated that “he had
       discussed the trip with the President and that he could speak with some assurance that his
       remarks would reflect the President's thoughts.” You may wish to stress
       in your discussions with Mr. Stewart that Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName>'s views are a matter of public record and do not
       necessarily reflect those of the Administration. Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName>'s statement that we had guaranteed the Oder-Neisse line is,
       of course, inaccurate. Additionally, you may wish to suggest to Mr. Stewart that it would be
       desirable for him to disabuse the Soviets, should they refer to Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName>'s remarks, of any notion that they can use
       his comments to play on possible differences within the alliance regarding such matters as
       nuclear sharing and non-proliferation.</p>
                        <p>A cable from Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> requests that the
       content of his talks in Moscow not be made public prior to his return and report to <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353" facs="0381"/>the President. We have not informed our allies of the
       substance of these discussions.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> made the following points in response to
        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName>'s request for his views:</p>
                        <p>a. <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> attaches great importance to non-proliferation and
       to need to prevent German access to nuclear weapons;</p>
                        <p>b. <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> categorically opposed to any plans for giving the
        <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> such access in any form;</p>
                        <p>c. implementation of such plans would have a negative effect on the interests not only of
       the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, but also of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>,
        <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and others;</p>
                        <p>d. efforts to convince the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> that any nuclear sharing
       arrangements would be subject to adequate safeguards are futile;</p>
                        <p>e. if the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> does not want an improvement in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations, the
       implementation of any <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> plan will achieve this purpose;</p>
                        <p>f. a non-proliferation agreement would greatly improve US-Soviet relations, and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is prepared to discuss their draft treaty with all powers
       concerned.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> made the following comments:</p>
                        <p>a. <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is inconsistent in seeking <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> on the one hand and non-proliferation on the other;</p>
                        <p>b. <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> is aimed at the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>;</p>
                        <p>c. <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has nuclear delivery vehicles and access to nuclear
       warheads will make it ready for nuclear war;</p>
                        <p>d. creation of <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would result in great military tension
       and an immediate increase in military budgets in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
       and Eastern Europe;</p>
                        <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0382"/>
                        <p>f. if an <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> is created, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will take appropriate steps and respond in due manner.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> made the following remarks, expressing the
       belief that he could speak on behalf of the entire group:</p>
                        <p>a. he appreciated <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s argument on
       the inability to convince Soviet leaders on adequate safeguards for nuclear sharing
       arrangements;</p>
                        <p>b. there is a great division of opinion in the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> on the
        <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>; he personally is opposed to the idea;</p>
                        <p>c. the emphasis on <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> had declined in the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in recent months;</p>
                        <p>d. the JAEC had voted unanimously against the project;</p>
                        <p>e. the JAEC, as well as his group, was bipartisan and reflected the feeling in Congress
       generally;</p>
                        <p>f. the subject would be given a very close look by Congress, with due account given to
       views expressed by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, France and others;</p>
                        <p>g. while foreign policy is the prerogative of the Executive Branch, it is very difficult to
       implement without Congressional approval.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> made the following points:</p>
                        <p>a. the German problem was complicated and made even more so by <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> European policies;</p>
                        <p>b. sharply attacked the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> for aligning its policies with those of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>,
       which were revanchist;</p>
                        <p>c. the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had not taken issue with <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s remarks on the 1937 borders;</p>
                        <p>d. the present borders could be changed only by war;</p>
                        <p>e. the German problem can be solved only on the basis of the present boundaries, and on the
       basis of agreement between the two German states, which needed no special outside help;</p>
                        <p>f. West Germany had been the primary recipient of the Marshall Plan.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> said:</p>
                        <p>a. the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had guaranteed the Oder-Neisse line, and that de Gaulle had later
       supported this;</p>
                        <p>b. this border supposedly was subject to confirmation in a peace treaty, but that the line
       seems to have been drawn;</p>
                        <p>c. he rejected the assertion that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was helping
       revanchism or fascism in Germany;</p>
                        <p>d. we did not say <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> was right about the 1937
       borders;</p>
                        <p>e. reunification will not be imposed by force, and it is obvious that the two German
       nations will have a say, as will the four powers;</p>
                        <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0383"/>
                        <p>f. the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France had received larger shares of Marshall
       Plan assistance than the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Eastern Europe had been offered but had refused aid under
       the Plan.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">3. Vietnam</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName>, noting that we understood the Soviet
       position, observed that:</p>
                        <p>a. Vietnam was of paramount concern to the President, who, while having inherited the
       situation, was looking for ways to bring it to the conference table and an honorable
       resolution, and had expressed willingness to go anywhere any time toward this end;</p>
                        <p>b. his (<persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName>'s) September 1 speech
       in the Senate, which had been discussed with and approved by the President, should be
       compared with Pham Van Dong's four points;</p>
                        <p>c. there had been no response to his speech, and the war was now more likely to get worse
       rather than better;</p>
                        <p>d. in connection with suggestions to reconvene the Geneva Conference with consideration of
       Pham Van Dong's four points and a cessation of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
       bombing, he was certain this possibility would be given the most serious consideration by the
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> if Hanoi signalled that the conference could be resumed if
       we stopped bombing;</p>
                        <p>e. the President had also approved Sihanouk's idea for a conference on Cambodia,
       which might also discuss matters relating to other countries, but nothing had come of it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> reiterated standard Soviet positions on Vietnam, pointing out that:</p>
                        <p>a. the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had not been authorized or asked to negotiate
       on this matter;</p>
                        <p>b. the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> should talk directly with North and South Vietnam,
       in the latter instance with the Viet Cong;</p>
                        <p>c. the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> should cease bombing;</p>
                        <p>d. the Geneva Conference is not workable.</p>

                        <p>a. an improvement in bilateral relations, which they said they wanted, was hindered by
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policies on <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and
       Vietnam;</p>
                        <p>b. under the circumstances, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> questioned whether
       the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> desired better relations;</p>
                        <p>c. various <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> actions, such as certain Congressional
       resolutions, the Penkovsky Papers, and <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> shipping policies
       also increased <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet tensions.</p>

                            <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0384"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> pointed out that he had no magic formula for

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and I had the most candid and
       cordial conversation of our three-year acquaintance today. In approximate order of
       importance, the topics we discussed are as follows:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows Item 1, which deals with NATO and the Multilateral Force; for text, <ref target="frus1964-68v13#d111">see <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1964–1968, volume
        XIII, Document 111</ref>.]</p>
                        <p>2. Vietnam. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> raised this question
       only briefly. He expressed again the well-known Soviet view that a renewed and longer pause
       would be helpful. He said that the brevity of the pause of last spring had caused many
       members of his government to regard it as cynical. He said that if there could be a pause of
       “12 to 20 days” we could be assured of intense diplomatic effort. But
       he acknowledged under questioning that his government could give no advance assurances about
       the results of such diplomatic effort. He repeated the well-known Soviet view that it is
       psychologically impossible for a country under bombardment to agree to negotiations.</p>
                        <p>3. Private communication. Not only in the context of the European problem, but more
       generally, the Ambassador emphasized his view that private and informal communications
       between our two governments are important. He referred nostalgically to the period in which
       there was intimate communication with President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> both through his brother, and through informal written notes. I reminded
       him that in that period, everything that was said had been known to the Secretary of State
       and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>. He agreed, but he seemed to
       believe that there was something valuable in direct access to the White House, and he asked
       me where he could establish such <pb n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0385"/>contact if
       necessary. I told him that the President preferred generally to conduct this important
       business, as he now does, through the Secretary of State and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>, but I said that of course he could always reach me if
       he thought it necessary, and I also told him that I thought it would be helpful for him to be
       better acquainted with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Moyers</persName>. (We also agreed
       that informal communication between his counselors and my deputies would be helpful, and I
       expect that Messrs. Komer and <persName corresp="#p_BF1">Bator</persName> will be getting
       luncheon invitations from their opposite numbers.)</p>
                        <p>4. The Ford Foundation. The Ambassador said that he knew I was the subject of a current
       guessing game in Washington, and that he was interested to see how it would come out. I asked
       for advice, and he said that he thought it all depended on the sort of future I wanted.
       Similar problems arose in Moscow from time to time. A number of his friends had been
       successful in withdrawing from important official jobs into quieter and more academic
       pursuits-although usually at the expense of some temporary unpopularity with the ministers
       whom they had abandoned.</p>
                        <p>5. Habits of the Soviet bureaucracy. In my opening remark to the Ambassador, I commented on
       his obviously healthy appearance, and he told me of his month on the Black Sea and his month
       of intense consultations with all the members of his government who are curious about the
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. It became clear from these accounts that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> is a person of growing consequence in Moscow, and I
       think he rather expects to be offered a more important appointment at home soon. He agreed
       with me that men in our two foreign offices work too hard-he said he had had only three
       Sundays off in his two and one-half years as the head of the American desk. He thinks it is
       easier to be an Ambassador, and he clearly likes his present job. I told him at the end of
       lunch that we liked having him here-and I meant it.</p>

                        <p>1. Soviet reactions to <hi rend="italic">The Penkovskiy Papers</hi> have been violent
       beyond any past precedent, with numerous acts of retaliation threatened. <hi rend="italic">Probably the nub of the Soviet reaction was expressed by Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> to Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> when he observed that The Penkovskiy Papers seemed designed to cast
        aspersions on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and on certain Soviet citizens and
        were detrimental to U.S.-Soviet relations.</hi> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> went on to add that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could also
       “concoct a similar book” on the leadership of the Democratic Party, but
       did not wish to take such action.</p>
                        <p>2. Attached is a list of <hi rend="italic">recent Soviet publications which show that the
         <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has already concocted many such books and there is no
        evidence that the intent to continue publishing more of them has abated in the past
        year.</hi> Also attached are samples of this Soviet treatment taken from some of the
       publications described in the list.<note n="2" xml:id="d142fn2">Not attached.</note>

                        <p>As Amb. and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had been assigned to Mrs.
        <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> and myself as our guests for the United
       Nations concert, we invited them to the house for a cup of coffee before going to
       Constitution Hall.</p>
                        <p>Most of the conversation was of a trivial nature. I did, however, have a few minutes talk
       with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> alone.</p>
                        <p>In reply to my question, he stated that the Soviet Government believed the cessation of
       bombing of North Viet-Nam for a long enough (not defined) period might well lead to
       discussions for peaceful settlement. He implied that the Soviet Government would encourage
       North Vietnamese, but dodged being specific on just what his Government would do or what made
       them believe that Hanoi would take a constructive attitude. He did say that it was the Soviet
       opinion that Hanoi, though influenced by Peiping, was not controlled in their decisions by
       Peiping.</p>
                        <p>He then asked me whether the United States Government had any desire at the present time to
       improve relations with the Soviet Union or to come to any understandings. He inferred that it
       was his opinion that we did not and referred to the delay in ratification of the Consular
       Convention, decision on Moscow-New York air service, failure to improve trade and
       nonproliferation, etc. I explained the reasons for the delay in the ratification of the
       Consular Convention and in proposals for Congressional action on the President's
       building bridges trade policy. But I told him that from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s statements to me and other evidence, we had gained the
       impression that the Soviet Union did not wish to come to any new agreements in the nuclear
       field until Viet-Nam was out of the way. I asked whether the more recent statements made by
       Soviet Government officials indicated that Soviet policy had changed and that the Soviet
       Government was now ready to come to an agreement. He replied in the affirmative. He then
       discussed the German problem and problems of other countries with potential nuclear
       capability in connection with nonproliferation. He gave me the standard <pb n="360" xml:id="pg_360" facs="0388"/>line that if the Soviet Union and the United States came to an
       agreement, these matters could be dealt with as a second step.</p>
                        <p>He reiterated the impression he was gaining that the United States did not wish to improve
       relations at the present time. I denied this and pointed to some of the difficulties that the
       Soviets have placed in the way of reaching understandings.</p>
                        <p>I gathered he was doing a little “fishing.” The conversation was
       frank but relaxed.</p>

        (Both ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. There is nothing in the minor realignment of Soviet leadership occurring here last week
       which leads me to see any prospective changes in Soviet policy. I doubt that <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> any longer had important part in policy formulation,
       and his not unexpected retirement therefore of little significance. We all seem agreed that
        <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName>'s assumption of titular
       presidency probably means he is less effective rival for <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s power, and that <persName corresp="#p_SAN1">Shelepin</persName>'s restriction to party work has brought him more immediately
       under <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s control, even though
       latter's long-term potentiality for eventual power may prove to have been
       enhanced. Indeed, net effect of these and other changes suggests a moderate strengthening of
       present leadership as result of apparent improvement of <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s position and fact that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s status does not seem to have been affected.</p>
                        <p>2. Nor is there anything in economic and political statements accompanying these changes
       which suggests any important shift in Soviet foreign policy. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s long speech to supreme Soviet was restatement of familiar
       arguments, mainly against FedRep, and charted no new ground. We can perhaps take some comfort
       therefore from expectation <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0389"/>that Soviet
       leaders' present deliberate policies will remain in effect, and that one of their
       chief continuing concerns will be to avoid military conflict with U.S. in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>3. At same time, there has been disturbing increase in level of noise directed against us
       in last few weeks. We are now in midst, of another series of public meetings being staged
       throughout the country in protest against our “aggression” in Viet Nam,
       and I am sure we were spared another massive demonstration and perhaps attack against Embassy
       premises last Wednesday<note n="3" xml:id="d144fn3">December 8.</note> only because of lesson
       learned when the last one on March 4 got out of hand and Soviet authorities decided to hold
       these demonstrations in safer sections of Moscow. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s intemperate interview with Reston, uncompromising line he
       and others are taking toward U.S. in their talks with Stewart and other visitors, arbitrary
       travel ban in effect on our entire military staff, expulsion of Washington Post
       correspondent, continuing blight on exchanges-these are fairly stark features of our
       bilateral relations today and they are unrelieved by actions or statements looking in other
       direction.</p>
                        <p>4. It may be that one element helping to account for this sharper tone is
       Moscow's concern that we may be on eve of another escalation in Viet Nam war and
       its possible extension to Laos, which would give Soviet leadership yet another painful
       dilemma in terms of its putative leadership of world Communist movement, on one hand, and its
       reluctance to increase both scale and scope of aid to its Communist allies, on the other.
       Moscow's dispute with Peking, however, continues to be mainspring governing Soviet
       behavior, and it seems to be as true as it is irrational that the harder Peking presses
       Moscow, the more violently Moscow lashes out at us. Since it is also true that the more
       powerless the Soviet leaders feel themselves to be in affecting the outcome in Viet Nam, the
       greater their manifestation of hostility toward us, I fear we have nothing to look forward to
       but a great deal more of the same in the foreseeable months ahead.</p>

                        <p>2009. 1. When we had finished with problems of immediate concern in my meeting last night
       with Gromyko (Embtel 2000),<note n="2" xml:id="d145fn2">Dated December 22, it transmitted a
        brief summary of <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>'s 1–1/4 hour
        meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on December 22. The other
        problems discussed were the travel ban on military attachés, negotiations for a
        new exchanges agreement, non-proliferation and the Federal Republic of Germany, and the case
        of Newcomb Mott who was arrested on September 4 after crossing into the Soviet Union from
        Norway. Further documentation on the Mott case, which ended on January 21, 1966, when Soviet
        authorities informed the United States that he had committed suicide, is ibid., PS 7–1
         <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>/Mott,
        Newcomb.</note> I turned to over-all state of our relations. Our discussion centered on
       Vietnam and German access to nuclear weapons, and I did not see in <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s remarks evidence of any fresh thinking on
       either of these problems.</p>
                        <p>2. I began by recalling my recent conversation with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> in Washington<note n="3" xml:id="d145fn3">
                                <ref target="#d137">See Document 137</ref>.</note> in which I had had to tell him that I had
       found the President and others of our government discouraged by constant hostile tone of
       Soviet press and of statements by Soviet leaders, that I had regretted this trend in our
       affairs, and that I had been distressed on my return to find that if anything the attacks
       upon us had become even harsher. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that
       he could cite many of our own statements about <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and its
       policy which were hostile in extreme, and indeed there would not be file big enough to hold
       all anti-Soviet material in US press, and these attacks had increased of late. He said he
       knew of my conversation with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> but that he must
       tell me his opinion that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was to blame for fact that our
       relations had gotten cooler. We knew their appraisal of certain aspects of our policy, he
       said, and they made no effort to conceal it. But if true comparison could be made of the
       relative tone of hostility in each other's press and public statements, we would
       not be the gainer by such comparison.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said Soviet Government had always tried
       and was still trying to find common ground with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, to find
       points of agreement on all issues, but fact was that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> did
       not show same readiness. It was our policy in Vietnam above all which aggravated our
       relations, and he and <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had made this clear in their statements. It followed
       from all this, he said, that whether our relations deteriorated or not depended on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="363" xml:id="pg_363" facs="0391"/>
                        <p>4. I said I was glad to have him confirm Soviet interest in better relations. However, we
       had not been organizing anti-Soviet meetings all over <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> of
       kind Soviets had been holding against us in recent days, and it had been Soviet leaders who
       were speaking of a “freeze” in our relations. I said it was true that
       we had fundamental differences between us over Vietnam, but I had thought from our previous
       talks that there was an element of common interest in peaceful settlement and removal of this
       dangerous situation. Not only were Soviets taking harder propaganda line on Vietnam in
       general but going farther in stress on demand that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> must get
       out of Vietnam, on Pham Van Dong's four points, on the acceptance of the NFLSV.
       This could only delay rather than help towards settlement.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> denied there had been any change in
       Soviet line. He said it had been their position for two or three years that US forces had no
       place in South Vietnam; that it was <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> who had torpedoed 1954
       Geneva Agreements which called for elections and reunification. As for legitimate government
       in South Vietnam, it is only NLFSV which represented any real force there and it is they, and
       “not those who are constantly changing like a kaleidoscope,” who are
       true government.</p>
                        <p>6. I concluded that I did not want today to engage <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in long debate on Vietnam. Our versions of history there were different.
       We considered that real breach of Geneva Agreement was aggression from North Vietnam.
       Whatever Soviets might think of our presence in Vietnam, we had undertaken a commitment to
       South Vietnamese Government, which continued to consist of people who like South Vietnamese
       in general were fighting to keep from being taken over by force. We did not like to be there,
       but we would honor our commitment. We had accepted Soviet Government's statements
       they were not in position to take action to facilitate peaceful settlement, but I hoped that
       at least they would not make statements and take positions which would make it harder for
       solution to be reached.</p>
                        <p>7. At this point Gromyko shifted our conversation to German nuclear access, subject of

       January 10 memorandum that reads: “This is the message which Dean Rusk mentioned
       at our meeting at noontime. It is well worth reading.”</p>
                        <p>2141. 1. In talks with colleagues here, I find considerable uncertainty and confusion as to
       where Soviets are heading as respects Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>2. My experience with the Soviets would suggest to me that where their aims and intentions
       are not reasonably clear to experienced observers, this means that they are themselves in a
       state of some uncertainty and confusion on the subject in question.</p>
                        <p>3. Until a couple of months ago every competent foreign observer in Moscow would have said
       with complete confidence that despite their noisy support of and military and economic aid to
        <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, Soviet leadership clearly wanted negotiated solution in
       Vietnam and could be expected use influence to this end, short of undue pressure on
       Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>4. Soviet actions since about time major ChiCom attack last November have somewhat shaken
       this relatively optimistic view, notably escalation vicious anti-American campaign and
       evidence leadership trying organize world Communist meeting on agenda limited to
       “unity in support Vietnam against American imperialism.” As minimum,
       this seemed to indicate Soviets not only sensitive Chicom attacks but had accepted and were
       ready to support obdurate stand North Vietnamese against negotiations. Since proposed
       conference apparently projected for time 23rd Party Conference, this effort implied Soviet
       expectation not serious steps toward peaceful settlement at least until sometime after March
       1966.</p>
                        <p>5. Soviet behavior since suspension <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365" facs="0393"/>of bombing and
       launching of peace offensive<note n="2" xml:id="d146fn2">For documentation on the 37-day

       prospect. Their press commentary on our peace offensive has been cynical, taking cue from
       Hanoi in interpreting it as propagandistic preparation for further escalation of war, and
       only once mentioning fact of our suspension of bombing and that in course of reprinting a
        <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> statement. <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName> took an unbending position with both me and French Ambassador in our
       discussions of Vietnam with him on December 29 and 30, and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s remarks on Vietnam to Japanese journalists published <hi rend="italic">in Izvestiya</hi> on December 31 were calculatedly hard line. Even more
       significantly, composition of <persName corresp="#p_SAN1">Shelepin</persName>'s
       delegation to Vietnam<note n="3" xml:id="d146fn3">A.N. <persName corresp="#p_SAN1">Shelepin</persName> led a five-person Soviet mission to Hanoi January
       7–12.</note>—timing of which indicates to me that it could have had no connection
       with our peace efforts-has clearly been intended to emphasize the possibility of increased
       military support for North Vietnamese with its inclusion of rocket expert Tolubko and
       Ustinov, whose career has centered on Soviet defense industry. Finally, the strong attack
       against us in Soviet draft co-chairmen message (Embtel 2111),<note n="4" xml:id="d146fn4">Not
        found.</note> published in today's <hi rend="italic">Pravda,</hi> is yet another
       indication that Soviet preoccupation has been more in terms of how to exploit Vietnamese
       situation against us than to help find a peaceful settlement.</p>
                        <p>6. The picture is by no means as clear, however, and the outlook probably not as gloomy as
       the foregoing suggests. There is in all of this, in fact, a strong element of inertia, of
       continuity with the positions previously assumed by the Soviet leadership, suggesting that it
       may not yet have faced up to the decisions required by our peace offensive. In weighing these
       decisions, Moscow will be mindful of several factors which will give it pause:</p>
                        <p>A. Moscow undoubtedly recognizes that <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> has little hope
       of prevailing ultimately against U.S. power, especially if this power is more fully exerted.
       While <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName> in his conversation with me followed
       established line, I was impressed by his description of widespread devastation caused by our
       bombing in <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and his sense of acceptance that, even with
       aid of socialist camp, <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> could not defeat U.S. (with
       implicit recognition that Soviet and other outside aid would be limited and would not involve
       direct conflict between us). I was also struck by <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName>'s repeated expressions about improvement of U.S.-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations in 1966, though this could simply be a reflection
       of his rather Khrushchevian personality.</p>
                        <p>B. Our peace offensive introduces highly complicating element in conduct of
       Moscow's own campaign for leadership both of world Communist movement and of third
       world. Our current efforts are bound to have an impact on a number of socialist
       governments-Yugoslavia and Poland may be good examples-which may already have misgivings
       about wisdom of Vietnam's unyielding line, and this impact will be still greater
       among third world states whose allegiance Moscow has insistently sought over recent months.
       Among other results, Soviet efforts <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0394"/>to bring about
       an anti-American conference of Communist parties in support of Vietnam could run into even
       greater resistance than is now the case. Of more immediate importance to us, the longer our
       bombing suspension lasts, the greater I should imagine the pressures will be on the Soviet
       leadership from socialist and especially third world states to contribute to a settlement in
       Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>C. Perhaps the most important factor of all will be Soviet concern about longer-term
       results of situation in which it must expect continuing buildup of U.S. military strength to
       point that cannot yet be foreseen. I think it unquestionably true that first aim of new
       Soviet leadership is to get their lagging economy moving again, and they cannot look with
       equanimity on prospect of substantial increase in defense portion of our budget which will
       require them either to fall further behind in terms of our relative military power positions
       or sacrifice some of their own economic plans in order to divert resources to defense
       purposes. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> has several times voiced his concern
       on this score.</p>
                        <p>7. I suspect that above considerations add up to as mixed a picture in Soviet minds as it
       does in ours. I am inclined to believe that, for time being at least, Moscow will feel
       constrained to appear to match prospect of increased U.S. escalation. This indeed is meaning
       of Ustinov's and Tolubko's inclusion in <persName corresp="#p_SAN1">Shelepin</persName>'s delegation. In fact, however, it cannot be excluded that,
       behind smokescreen of this ostensibly offense-minded delegation, <persName corresp="#p_SAN1">Shelepin</persName> will also be talking with North Vietnamese leaders about coping with
       our peace offensive in ways more satisfactory-at least from Moscow's
       viewpoint-than the present negative, unyielding line. Moscow's public line on our
       peace efforts has clearly lacked conviction, and they must know that it has not been
       convincing for others and does not square with image of peace-maker in Asia they are trying
       to create.</p>
                        <p>8. It is worth noting in this connection that in his expectedly tough speeches in Hanoi,
        <persName corresp="#p_SAN1">Shelepin</persName> has refrained from joining Vietnamese in
       characterizing “peace offensive” as “lying
       campaign” and “fraud” (septel)<note n="5" xml:id="d146fn5">Telegram 2136 from Moscow, January 8. (National Archives and Records Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 32–1 INDIA–PAK)</note> and it is
       clear subject is one which will have to be dealt with in private talks. While Soviets will
       continue to be careful not to seem to be forcing Hanoi's hand, we consider likely
       they will argue circumstances require some more positive response from
       “socialist” side. Since we know Soviets are impressed by bomb damage
       and that bombing of “socialist” state is most galling aspect of whole
       situation to them, our best guess is that <persName corresp="#p_SAN1">Shelepin</persName> may
       well advise Hanoi initiation talks would assure indefinite suspension bombing without
       prejudice to their military position in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0395"/>
                        <p>9. In sum, we think “peace” campaign has introduced new element
       further complicating Soviet efforts organize Communist meeting around Vietnam and forcing
       them a step away from unquestioning acceptance Hanoi's objuracy. It could not have
       been better timed and I would hope pressure can be sustained.</p>

                        <p>Secto 10. Eyes Only for President and Acting Secretary from Secretary.</p>
                        <p>Vice President and I accompanied by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCA1">Bowles</persName> spent an hour and a half with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> this afternoon. Translation cut conversation to 45 minutes talking time.
       Here are my most immediate impressions pending more detailed memorandum of conversation.<note n="2" xml:id="d147fn2">Not found.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1 <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s general attitude was direct,
       reasonably relaxed, and with a certain friendly informality in demeanor. Only occasionally
       did he slip into traditional Moscow verbiage such as “highway men” and
       “pirates” on which he was promptly picked up.</p>
                        <p>2. The most important aspect of conversation was what he did not say. There were no
       threats, nothing bordering on ultimatums, no declarations about increased Soviet assistance
       to Hanoi, or elements of that sort. That may come later but he did not produce them
       today.</p>
                        <p>3. He showed some reluctance to talk about Viet Nam and did not go into any details about
       specific points of settlement. He made it clear that he had no mandate from Hanoi, that he
       did not represent Hanoi, and that he was not a messenger for Hanoi or for us. He said we
       would have to find our own channels.</p>
                        <p>4. He made the usual point that this was an indigenous Vietnamese affair and that we should
       stay out of it. He was reminded that <pb n="368" xml:id="pg_368" facs="0396"/>divided states
       such as Germany, Korea and Viet Nam present a special problem and that the attempt to use
       force in any of these divided states across demarcation lines was just as serious a threat to
       the peace as aggression across established national frontiers.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> also remarked that we thought that we
       were being “noble” in withholding bombing which we had no right to do
       anyhow and that our act appeared to be an ultimatum. I gave him a very frank statement on the
       background of the present pause, pointing out that the governments of the Soviet Union,
       Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Rumania and others have been telling us for months that there
       was no possibility of taking steps towards peace while the bombs were falling in the North. I
       recounted that we had asked for months for some hint or indication or suggestion of what
       would happen if we stopped the bombing but had received no answer at all except that Gromyko
       had said “Stop and see”, and that Hungary had said, with Soviet
       knowledge, that they were convinced that “something good” would happen.
       I told him that we had decided to find out. I told him that we had thus far had no reply
       through any channel to our peace efforts and that we had observed that North Viet Nam was
       continuing to infiltrate and could count considerable numbers of trucks moving south.</p>
                        <p>6. He offered nothing on <persName corresp="#p_SAN1">Shelepin</persName>'s visit
       and gave no specific answer to questions about procedure, namely, how they thought future
       contacts with Hanoi could best be handled. I would gather from his treatment of these
       subjects that (a) the collective leadership in Moscow has had no chance to consider the
       results of <persName corresp="#p_SAN1">Shelepin</persName>'s visit, (b) he already
       knew <persName corresp="#p_SAN1">Shelepin</persName> got nowhere in Hanoi, or (c) that he had
       not been informed about the closing day or so of <persName corresp="#p_SAN1">Shelepin</persName>'s visit.</p>
                        <p>7. In sum, I would think that our talk today represented little or no change in the problem
       as we know it except that it was of some importance that he did not approach the issue in
       belligerent tones as between the Soviet Union and the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> but
       rather as an issue between Hanoi and the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>8. I have not taken time to detail the statements made by Vice President and myself but I
       would compliment the Vice President in his presentation of your own position. We left with
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> full copy of your State of the Union
        message.<note n="3" xml:id="d147fn3">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the
         Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>,

                        </p>
                        <p>9. It was interesting that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was especially
       anxious that our talk not be represented to the press as a negotiation on Viet Nam. He was
       most insistent that it be described simply as a courtesy visit during which the two sides
       exchanged views on matters of common concern. <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0397"/>Obviously he did not wish to expose himself to Peiping and Hanoi on this point and I would
       suggest that we not ourselves disclose the substance of the talk nor let it be built up as an
       interview of major importance. My guess is that we shall hear more from Moscow when their
       various travelers get home and can compare notes with <persName corresp="#p_SAN1">Shelepin</persName>.</p>

                        <p>In a telegram to the Secretary of State I have reported on a conversation with Ambassador
        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> at a private dinner at his house in
       Washington last night pursuant to his invitation which I accepted after consultation with
       Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BG1">Ball</persName>. I have asked that this telegram be
       passed to the White House for your information (attached).<note n="9" xml:id="d148fn9">See

       said to me he regretted very much there was no informal line of communication between the
       White House and himself on important matters affecting Soviet-American relations. He said
       that during President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s
       administration such informal channel existed in the presence of the then Attorney General. He
       quickly added that because of Senator <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s present position this obviously is no longer feasible but
       emphasized that another channel would in his opinion be helpful. He went on to say this did
       not in any way denigrate from his very cordial and close relations with the Secretary of
       State and Ambassador Thompson. Rather his point was that Soviet leaders felt reassured if
       another channel to the President was open to them.</p>

                        <p> Rowan called on me to report a luncheon conversation on Saturday, with Chernyakov and
       Kalugin of the Soviet Embassy. The Soviet Embassy officials had told Rowan that the Soviet
       Government was perfectly prepared to carry on normal bilateral relations with the U.S., but
       had so far failed to receive the necessary degree of cooperation from U.S. authorities. They
       cited as illustrations of this state of affairs the Soviet willingness to put into effect the
       Civil Air Agreement and the Consular Convention and said baldly that the negative attitude of
       the U.S. Government had prevented any progress along this line. Rowan asked me what I thought
       of this rationale presented by the Soviet officials.</p>
                        <p>I told Rowan that with regard to the Civil Air Agreement and Consular Convention I was
       obliged to admit that there was an element of truth in the Soviet argument. I then briefly
       reviewed for Rowan the history of both agreements and told him that it was unlikely that any
       final action on them would be taken in the near future. I pointed out, however, that the
       Soviets' own record was not quite so clean and bright <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0400"/>as the Soviet Embassy interlocutors had led him to believe. The Soviets were
       primarily responsible for the slowdown of exchanges. They had refused to permit American
       performing arts groups to tour the Soviet Union in accordance with commitments under the
       exchange agreement, they had so far been almost totally unresponsive to our request for
       negotiations on a new exchanges agreement, and they had given indications that the outlook
       for exchanges was rather bleak in view of the current situation in Vietnam. I pointed out to
       Rowan that the Soviet argument that exchanges could not go on in a normal way because of our
       “changed policy in Vietnam” was without any substance; as the Soviets
       well knew our policy had been constant throughout three administrations. Obviously the tempo
       and nature of our support under this policy to the South Vietnamese had undergone change but
       this change was in response to actions taken by the other side in the Vietnam conflict. In a
       word it was Soviet policy not U.S. policy that had changed.</p>
                        <p> Rowan also reported a complaint by his Soviet hosts concerning the “visa
       war” which was now being waged by the State Department on foreign correspondents.
       I told Mr. Rowan that this was not the first time I had heard this complaint. I felt it
       important that Rowan understand that any difficulties that had arisen with regard to
       correspondents should be laid squarely at the Soviet door. I then reviewed for Rowan the
       history of expulsions of American correspondents from Moscow and told him that the arbitrary
       Soviet attitude toward the American press had naturally resulted in a certain lack of
       enthusiasm on our part for rapid processing of visas for Soviet correspondents here. The
       Soviets clearly understand, however, that if they would issue a visa to Watson of ABC any
       logjam that they might think exists would be quickly broken. I said it might be useful for
       Rowan to reinforce this line with the Soviets at his next meeting.</p>
                        <p> Rowan said that he hoped to be able to visit the Soviet Union sometime next spring (a
       tentative departure date is March 20) and he had discussed with Chernyakov and Kalugin the
       possibilities of arranging interviews with top Soviet leaders during his visit. They gave him
       some encouragement and said they would check his request with appropriate authorities and be
       in touch with him at a later date as to interview possibilities. They expressed the hope that
       if he should go to Moscow he would not behave as Jimmy Reston had; they said that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was shocked by Reston's comments in his
       column following the interview, particularly his description of <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> as tough, doctrinaire, and essentially anti-American.<note n="2" xml:id="d149fn2">For text of the transcript of the <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>/Reston interview and Reston's comments thereon, see <hi rend="italic">The New York Times,</hi> December 8, 1965.</note>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. Soviets over past year have grown increasingly frustrated over contrast between avid
       demand for <hi rend="italic">Amerika</hi> in <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> (Swedish
       correspondent just telephoned to say queue today at Gorky street bookstore for <hi rend="italic">Amerika</hi>'s was longest line-150 meters-he had ever seen in
       queue-laden Moscow) and lack of success Soviet Life in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>.
       Recent manifestations this frustration (see referenced airgrams) have led us to conclusion
       Soviets likely to press in negotiations for reduction or curtailment present 60,000 agreed
       circulation.</p>
                        <p>2. As <hi rend="italic">Amerika</hi> is highly effective medium, widely known in <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, first and only American magazine available to Soviet
       readers, provides striking and attractive visual depiction American life and, hopefully,
       represents first wedge in our efforts to open Soviet society to American periodicals, Emb
       assumes we will wish to defend <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> interest involved to maximum
       our ability in negotiations. Should we voluntarily curtail circulation Soviets will have
       achieved their aim without confronting our strong opposition at conference table and would
       certainly be greatly encouraged to consider effort eliminate magazine altogether. If this is
       their objective, we could probably expect to receive additional and increasing returns on
       40,000 copies in manner similar to experience leading to previous cessation of publication of
        <hi rend="italic">Amerika</hi>. Additional returns could then be cited at negotiations to
       justify Soviet position interest in <hi rend="italic">Amerika</hi> falling off.</p>
                        <p>3. I strongly recommend we continue to exercise right to circulate 60,000 copies. To meet
       obvious difficulty we would now have defending indefinite continuation present method of
       mailing returned copies, <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0402"/>we could mail them

                        </list>
                        <p>The Soviets last year proposed that the Bolshoi Ballet tour the United States this spring
       as the first attraction under a new exchanges agreement for 1966–67. Sol Hurok, who has acted
       as impresario for many Soviet groups, has been handling arrangements for the Bolshoi
       tour.</p>
                        <p>Based upon this planning, the Soviets last year offered the Bolshoi to the United Nations
       for a benefit performance in New York on behalf of the United Nations International School.
       At the United Nations Secretariat's request, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> last August agreed to share sponsorship of the benefit
       with the Secretary General and Soviet Ambassador Federenko. It was assumed that the Bolshoi
       Ballet would come to the United States in the normal course of the exchanges program. Last
       month, under encouragement from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HS1">Hurok</persName>, the United
       Nations Secretariat issued invitations for a benefit performance at the Metropolitan Opera
       House on April 19, which would be the opening night of the proposed United States tour. These
       invitations carried the written sponsorship of U Thant, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> and Ambassador Federenko.</p>
                        <pb n="375" xml:id="pg_375" facs="0403"/>
                        <p>By way of background, under our Exchanges Agreement with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for 1964–65, each side agreed to receive five performing arts groups. We have
       received all five Soviet groups, but the Soviets have failed to receive our fifth group. As a
       result, we informed the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in December that, unless a new
       agreement is concluded or assured and unless the Soviets deal with their remaining obligation
       to receive an attraction under the last agreement, no Soviet performing arts groups would be
       permitted to come to the United States. This includes the Bolshoi Ballet.</p>
                        <p>We agree with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> that failure to hold
       the line would encourage the Soviets to think that they could carry on an exchanges program
       suitable to them in the absence of an agreement assuring an adequate quid pro quo to the
       United States.<note n="2" xml:id="d151fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> expressed his views on the invitation in

                        </p>
                        <p>I have now instructed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> to take up
       with Ambassador Federenko the question of the United Nations benefit performance of the
       Bolshoi Ballet.<note n="3" xml:id="d151fn3">The instructions were sent to <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> in telegram 1947 to <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>, February 13 at 1:38 p.m. (Ibid.)</note> He will point out that (1) his
       acceptance of co-sponsorship of the benefit was based upon the assumption that the ballet
       would be touring in the United States on the basis of a new exchanges agreement; (2) because
       of our support for the United Nations school, we are prepared to admit the Bolshoi Ballet
       specifically and only for the United Nations benefit performance in New York on April 19; and
       (3) as we have informed the Soviet Government, we would not be prepared to permit the Bolshoi
       to make any other appearances in the United States in the absence of a new agreement and
       without a satisfactory arrangement on the unfulfilled commitment under the previous
       agreement.</p>
                        <p>We can anticipate that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HS1">Hurok</persName> will seek to reverse
       our position concerning the United States tour of the Bolshoi, and he may shortly try
       pressuring the White House with this in mind. I think it is important that we stand firm,
       leaving the burden on the Soviets to move ahead on a new agreement. The single United Nations
       performance will be costly to them unless they get an entire tour, which we should refuse
       without an agreement.</p>

        and Yuri Daniel had been sentenced to 7 and 5 years, respectively, in a corrective labor

                        <p>1. In view foreign furor, especially by western Communists over Sinyavsky/Daniel case, it
       worth speculating on factors motivating Soviets in their handling of case, and degree to
       which Soviet aims achieved.</p>
                        <p>2. We were told by Soviet source decision on how to handle case was reached “at
       highest level,” and we inclined believe this. Before trial and Soviet publicity,
       there were rumors Sinyavsky and Daniel would be given lenient treatment, possibly even trial
       by comradely court; and after first press attack, we had report Demichev had stated attacker
       had gone too far. It logical assume Demichev subsequently overruled higher up, hence at
       Presidium level. Length of time between arrest and trial does not appear to have been
       required in order build up case, since prosecution relied primarily on defendants'
       writings, culling of which did not require four months. Delay, therefore, may have been
       result of difference of opinion within regime, difference centering on method and degree of
       punishment. Fact they should be dealt with in some fashion does not appear to have been
       questioned.</p>
                        <p>3. Tertz/Arzhak <note n="3" xml:id="d152fn3">These were Sinyavsky's and
        Daniel's pen names.</note> writings clearly hit too close to fundamentals of
       system. Once it proved their true identity, regime had to act. Regime doubtless really
       believes their writings constitute anti-Soviet activity, and in this sense is honest in
       insisting case is separate issue from that of literary freedom. Tertz/Arzhak writings do, in
       fact, go far beyond range of current internal literary debate and problem for regime was
       compounded by fact Sinyavsky, at least, enjoyed good local reputation, especially among more
       liberal intellectuals and youth.</p>
                        <p>4. Problem, as far as regime concerned, was basically internal—culprits had to
       be punished both for their own sake and to deter others—and this internal aspect
       took precedence over problems of foreign repercussions. Since regime also apparently felt it
       necessary to destroy reputations of culprits, publicity was required and this best
       accomplished by a trial which at same time could reflect “Soviet
       legality.” <pb n="377" xml:id="pg_377" facs="0405"/>In addition, while KGB was
       probably not averse to seeing intellectuals as whole shaken up a bit, Party seems to have
       wanted avoid this and have been at pains to emphasize separation of case from question
       literary freedom. Thus, certain aspect of domestic requirements somewhat dovetailed with
       problem of avoiding foreign outcry, even though latter was only secondary factor in Soviet
       considerations.</p>
                        <p>5. Above considerations led to Soviet publicity campaign, to semi-open trial (relatives,
       and some respected individuals such as Tvardovsky were allowed attend), and to unusual
       spectacle of defendants being allowed plead innocent and have this reported, and being heard,
       apparently at some length. Trial went on four days.</p>
                        <p>6. In context Soviet legal procedures, all was nicely legal, and regime no doubt considers
       it gave them fair trial. It probably even thought this observance of Soviet legal norms would
       tend diminish foreign outcries. Soviet judicial procedures, however, are eminently flexible,
       and in order score their domestic points, regime exploited this flexibility fully, making
       trial complete mockery of justice: threatening students who tried attend with expulsion,
       stationing Komsomol thugs outside courthouse, barring all foreigners (including Communists),
       publishing distorted press accounts containing complete prejudgment of case, suppressing
       evidence (so reminiscent of Mott case), especially Paustovsky statement defending
       Sinyavsky/Daniel.</p>
                        <p>7. Effect Soviet handling of case will have on primary target, potential shippers abroad of
       anti-Soviet writings, is obviously impossible to determine, but will presumably be beneficial
       from regime's point of view, at least temporarily. In this sense, therefore, they
       may regard operation as success.</p>
                        <p>8. Other domestic effects seem less favorable, however. Trial has certainly left some
       segments of intellectuals worried. While KGB and certain hard-liners probably not disturbed
       by this, Party apparatus charged with supervision of intellectuals apparently is, since it
       prefers intellectuals who behave docilely by choice and conviction, not because they cowed.
       Hence effort in February 22 <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> article to reassure intellectuals
       trial does not affect literary scene was aimed primarily at criminal activity. Meanwhile,
       facts that trial virtually closed, that press reports distorted, and that evidence suppressed
       are certainly no secret here. Suppression Paustovsky statement will prove particularly
       damaging among intellectual circles, since he highly respected figure.</p>
                        <p>9. As for foreign reaction, while Soviets were probably willing ride out foreign uproar,
       they seem to have grossly miscalculated its extent, and are particularly pained by extent of
       foreign Communist attacks. Latter, furthermore, will have domestic repercussions, especially
       among intellectual circles, since Soviet public no longer completely shut off from outside
       news.</p>
                        <pb n="378" xml:id="pg_378" facs="0406"/>
                        <p>10. It appears, therefore, Soviets probably benefited little from their effort to gain
       credit by supplying trappings, but not substance, of justice. By this halfway treatment, with
       its attendant publicity, they created more interest in writers than probably would have been
       the case if they had thrown them out, as they did Tarsis,<note n="4" xml:id="d152fn4"> Valery
        Tarsis was deprived of his Soviet citizenship on February 21; he eventually settled in
        Greece.</note> or conducted secret trial. It was half-open handling of case, and attempts
       present it as valid legal operation, that made it impossible, for example, for western
       Communists overlook distortions of justice. Soviets achieved their immediate
       objective-punishment and deterrence-but at cost, both domestic and international, far higher
       than what they probably had expected.</p>

                        <p>Today we opened negotiations in Washington to renew our over-all agreement with the Soviets
       for across-the-board exchanges ranging from science to tourism.<note n="2" xml:id="d153fn2">On February 14, 1966, Sergei K. Romanovsky, Chairman of the Soviet State Committee for

                        </p>
                        <p>If successful, this will be the fifth agreement—the first was in
       1958—and will cover the period 1966–67.</p>
                        <pb n="379" xml:id="pg_379" facs="0407"/>
                        <p>The Soviets have been dragging their feet in starting these talks. Now they have given us a
       draft and want to wind up matters quickly. They talk of two weeks whereas the 1964–65
       negotiations took 46 days. We are ready to cooperate in arriving at an agreement promptly but
       only if the Soviets do not persist in rehashing old arguments already settled in previous
       agreements and only if they give us satisfaction on clauses which will assure adequate
       reciprocity and a truly balanced agreement.</p>
                        <p>Repetition of the “Hello, Dolly!” episode<note n="3" xml:id="d153fn3">Although never canceled, the Soviet Union continually delayed the appearance of
        “Hello, Dolly” in Moscow throughout 1965.</note> must be prevented by
       making it clear that no Soviet performance will be allowed here unless we have a firm
       contract in hand for an American performance there. We must assure adequate arrangements for
       distribution of <hi rend="italic">Amerika</hi> magazine in the Soviet Union. We must obtain
       reasonable access for American exhibits in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. And we
       must keep the whole program under U.S. Government direction and not allow them to by-pass the
       State Department in their dealings with private American organizations. These are essentials
       on which we will insist.</p>
                        <p>We expect hard bargaining but no serious problems in the other fields: scientific,
       technical, agricultural, medical, educational, films, cultural, sports and tourism.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet draft of the proposed agreement would reduce the exchanges somewhat, in keeping
       with the Viet-Nam atmosphere. Significantly, the draft also omits the color words of previous
       agreements, which implied a desire for more friendly relations. They may have seriously
       debated stopping the exchanges entirely but evidently decided otherwise. We would like to put
       the emphasis on expansion of exchanges and on language conveying the idea of improving
       relations but will not fight hard on these points. The important thing is to keep the program
       going, if we can do so, on a fully equitable basis.</p>

                        <p>We have now completed negotiations and are prepared to sign on March 16 a new two-year
       exchanges agreement with the Soviet Union.<note n="2" xml:id="d154fn2">For text of the
        Agreement, signed March 19, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current
         Documents, 1966,</hi> pp. 461–476.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The new agreement provides for a balanced program of exchanges generally comparable in
       scope and size to the previous program. The agreement also preserves the provisions which
       keep the program under United States Government direction.</p>
                        <p>In addition, we successfully introduced new language regarding the appearance of performing
       arts groups in order to prevent any repetition of the “Hello, Dolly!”
       situation. Henceforth, if the Soviets fail to receive an agreed American group, we now have a
       clearly understood basis for refusing their groups. The Soviets are also signing today a
       contract to receive the Iowa State Symphony Band to make up for their failure to receive
       “Hello, Dolly!”. Thus, when we sign the over-all agreement on
       Wednesday, the way will be clear for the Bolshoi Ballet to come to the United States on April
       19.</p>
                        <p>After prolonged resistance, the Soviets finally accepted an exchange of two exhibits. The
       previous agreement had provided for an exchange of three exhibits, but in practice the
       Soviets refused to approve more than two, since American exhibits are politically troublesome
       for them.</p>
                        <p>We made clear to the Soviets our concern over obtaining adequate arrangements for
       distribution of <hi rend="italic">Amerika</hi> magazine in the U.S.S.R. They in turn
       indicated that our distribution would be improved if circulation of their magazine <hi rend="italic">Soviet Life</hi> increases in the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet decision to negotiate the agreement, after months of stalling, and Soviet
       willingness to receive American attractions beginning next month (after refusing to do so
       since last September on the grounds of Viet-Nam) indicate a Soviet desire not only to keep
       the exchanges program alive, but also to avoid further deterioration in U.S.-U.S.S.R.
       relations.</p>

                        <p>The Soviets have indicated that they wish a minimum of publicity on the agreement.
       Obviously they are sensitive to Peiping's charges of Soviet-American
       collaboration. For our part, we see no reason to play up the agreement.</p>

                        <p>At a luncheon that the Secretary gave for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> today, the Ambassador raised the status of bilateral problems between
       our two countries. The Secretary said that the Ambassador would have observed the statements
       that had been made by <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> and others on the
       Consular Agreement. This was simply the result of a nose count. When <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked about the Air Agreement, the Secretary observed
       that this did not require action by the Senate and was still under consideration.</p>
                        <p>On the subject of the negotiations for a Cultural Exchange Agreement, the Secretary assured
       the Ambassador that the last-minute difficulties had not been the result of any deception on
       the part of our negotiators. <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382" facs="0410"/>He hoped that we would
       be able to give the Ambassador very shortly our views on what would be required to complete
       the Agreement. He pointed out that we have some rather special problems in this country
       because in our case it is not simply the Government that is involved, but the people we have
       to contract with to carry out some phases of the Agreement.</p>
                        <p>In the course of the conversation, the Secretary referred to a subject which he had
       previously mentioned to the Ambassador, and that was the matter of personal attacks upon the
       President. He explained that the President took very seriously the role which he and the
       Soviet leaders had to play as Heads of the two most powerful countries in the world. The
       Secretary observed that there appeared to have been some improvement in respect to personal
       attacks since his last talk with the Ambassador on this subject, for which he expressed his
       appreciation.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> vigorously argued that no Soviet
       leaders had, to the best of his knowledge, attacked the President personally. He said, of
       course they did express themselves strongly on matters of policy and such things as they
       considered to be American imperialism, but he said he had carefully studied the Soviet press
       and he knew of no single incident of a personal attack upon the President by the leaders of
       the Soviet Government. He spelled out the difference between a “Tass
       statement,” which was a rather official declaration and the publication by Tass of
       despatches from their correspondents. The Soviet press did report on matters relating to the
       President, usually by quotations from the American press, but he repeated that he knew of no
       attacks by the Soviet leaders themselves.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would check into this matter.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary referred to the problem of a location for a new Soviet Embassy in Washington
       and said that we would do all we could to help. When <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked about the possibility of their getting Tregaron, the Secretary
       said he had to state frankly that the prospects of obtaining a decision to rezone the area
       which would make this possible did not seem very bright. Upon further questioning from
        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, he said we would be glad to look further
       into the question as to whether or not we could make any Federal property available.</p>

                        <p>At a luncheon conversation with the Soviet Ambassador today, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> said that he thought the Soviet Government made a
       mistake when we returned Soviet defectors to the Soviet Union; the Soviet press published
       charges and attacks against us. He said that we had followed scrupulously a principle of
       returning anyone who wanted to go back, but the Soviet action in exploiting these people made
       it more difficult for us to maintain our policy. When the Ambassador pointed out that Soviet
       actions were based upon statements made by the returned defectors, the Secretary and Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> pointed out that the returned defectors
       naturally had to try to justify their actions.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then launched upon a very
       vigorous discussion of our actions in promptly getting hold of Soviet defectors in every part
       of the world. He mentioned the recent case in Greece as an example. He said he was quite sure
       that we got little of value from these people but he could assure the Secretary that our
       actions in quickly getting hold of these people and flying them to the United States made a
       very strong impression upon his Government and had a serious effect upon our bilateral
       relations.</p>

                        <p rend="center">Summary</p>
                        <p>The view that efforts for resumption of détente with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should have the highest priority in our policy appears to
       have acquired some currency in recent months. The specific calculations which might argue for
       such a course seem to have been only vaguely articulated, however. This paper attempts to
       define and evaluate them.</p>
                        <p>The conclusions reached are not very hopeful for the near term. The argument that the
       détente marked by the 1963 test ban was intended by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to open a phase of continuing improvement in Soviet-American relations does
       not stand close analysis. The Soviets had more limited aims in view and soon returned to
       traditional priorities.</p>
                        <p>The avenue of progress through new arms control agreements remains blocked by the
       persistence of strong Soviet inhibitions against inspection. Political exploitation of the
       disarmament issue evidently still weighs more heavily with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> than does the achievement of effective agreements.</p>
                        <p>The disorders and conflicts looming ahead in the Third World suggest the possibility of
       parallel action by the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to contain the risks. Thus far the Soviets appear to believe that these
       developments manifest “the world revolution” and can be used to
       diminish <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Western influence. As in the war between
       Pakistan and India, parallelism promises to be fortuitous and transient.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese challenge to Soviet influence in the Communist movement and in the Third World
       is currently the primary preoccupation <pb n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0413"/>of the
       leaders in Moscow. The imperatives of this struggle, in particular the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s need to avoid being outdone in revolutionary
       fervor, works against rather than for détente with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, the Soviet system is in some trouble, and there are pressures within it which
       may in time bring moderation and larger possibilities for transforming present tensions into
       tolerable coexistence. Our policy should be alert to these possibilities, but recognize that
       they are probably still some time off. A patient effort, undistracted by illusion, to
       manifest to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> both a desire for fair accommodation
       and effective resistance to its expansionist aims is still our best course.</p>
                        <p>[Here follow sections entitled: Some Propositions Said to Argue for Détente Now;
       The Détente of 1963: Meaning and Aftermath; The Soviet Interest in Arms Control
       and Non-Proliferation; Soviet Policy in the Third World; China as a Factor in Soviet-American
       Relations; and Change in the Soviet System.]</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusion</p>
                        <p>The various rationales which argue that now is a propitious time for a new advance in
       Soviet-American understanding are not very persuasive. The official Soviet view is that
       relations “have become considerably complicated and have a clear tendency toward
       freezing.” This seems nearer the mark.</p>
                        <p>American policy should, of course, always be open to improved understanding with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. And, in fact, it has always been extremely easy for the
       Soviets, even by mere gestures, to provoke new waves of hope in this country for such
       improvement. We do not need to burden ourselves with any feeling of guilt that it is we who
       have sought and sustained the cold war. The proposals we have made for settlement of major
       issues have not been designed to endanger the security of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. What they have evidently affronted, however, is the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s view of its interests as a revolutionary power bent on the
       extension of its own system.</p>
                        <p>What people usually mean when they speak of a new effort for understanding, though they do
       not necessarily say so explicitly, is that some sort of “sacrifices”
       should be made. Mere expressions of good will and new offers to talk are rightly recognized
       as insufficient to revive détente. It is always possible, of course, to advance
       understanding with the Soviets by conceding their demands, at least for a time. Currently
       they would be pleased to have us negotiate a settlement in Vietnam on Hanoi's
       terms, to abandon plans for nuclear sharing in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, to
       accept the indefinite division of Germany, to stop “exporting
       counterrevolution” by aiding states which are the victims of Communist subversion
       and insurrection. But the détente we could have <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0414"/>now on the basis of “sacrifices” of this kind would
       almost certainly be both damaging and short-lived.</p>
                        <p>The truth is that the clear insight we had when the issues of the cold war were starker and
       simpler is still valid: only “situations of strength” can make possible
       the kind of détente we seek. Such “situations” cannot be
       defined, however, as we have sometimes seemed to believe, merely in terms of preponderant
       military power and the will to use it. First and foremost, they are produced by promoting
       social and political cohesion of those states which are threatened by Communist
       encroachment.</p>
                        <p>Thus the basic elements of an effective American policy toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> remain what they were when the cold war began:</p>
                        <p>—Harbor no illusions and make no myths about the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s intentions, but pay close attention to what its leaders
       constantly say and actually do about the kind of world they want.</p>
                        <p>—Together with our allies, maintain an adequate margin of economic and military
       power.</p>
                        <p>—Do as much as we can to assist weaker societies in the less developed parts of
       the world to achieve viability and genuine independence, and thereby immunity to Communist
       influence.</p>
                        <p>—Offer and offer again to settle issues on terms which take account of the
       legitimate aspirations and security of all states, including the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, but on no other terms.</p>
                        <p>—Press the Soviets again and again to open their society, to make coexistence
       real, and to acknowledge that there must be one world, but one that allows for all
       diversity.</p>
                        <p>There are no maneuvers of policy which can bring a quick fix in Soviet-American relations,
       and least of all can a policy which aims at détente for its own sake do so. The
       spirit of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s American
       University speech<note n="2" xml:id="d157fn2">Given on June 10, 1963; for text, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">John F. Kennedy</persName>, 1963,</hi> pp. 459–464.</note> is a proper
       part of our stance toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The words he addressed
       to the Soviet leaders in another tone about Berlin in 1961 and about missiles in Cuba in 1962
       are equally so. The only prudent judgment at present is that our policy will continue to
       require both of the ingredients contained in these utterances, the spirit of accommodation
       and the spirit of resistance, if we are to arrive eventually at a genuine détente
       with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>It is not unreasonable to hope for this if we are patient and do not try to act on
       potential historical developments before they are ripe. As suggested above, the next decades
       will be critical ones in the evolution of the Soviet system. Together with the liberalization
       of the internal political order which may come, there may be a growing desire for wider and
       freer contact with the outside world. This might in turn bring an <pb n="387" xml:id="pg_387" facs="0415"/>end to ideologically inspired hostility, and lead the Soviets to accept an
       international order which allows for variety and imposes limits on the power aspirations of
       all states and systems.</p>
                        <p>The desire to become a modern society and to share the benefits of progress in normal
       intercourse with other advanced societies is strong among the Soviet people. If and when it
       breaks through and begins to determine the conduct of the Soviet state, the constructive and
       cooperative relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> toward which our policy
       aims should be within reach. Until then, we may from time to time have phases we will call
       détente, and they may serve our interest, but we should not mistake the false dawn
       for the real.<note n="3" xml:id="d157fn3">On March 24 Rostow forwarded to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> a supplement to this paper, drafted by <persName corresp="#p_HJW1">Huizenga</persName> at <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s suggestion, that discussed “Areas of Mutual

       In addition to the Mott case <pb n="388" xml:id="pg_388" facs="0416"/>and Ambassador
        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s personal plans, discussion of

       general state of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations, some of the pending
       bilateral matters, as well as the new functions of A.A. Soldatov, former Soviet Ambassador in
       London.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> referred to Gromyko's
       claim in his speech at the Party Congress that the output of anti-Soviet propaganda
       “per square meter” is greater in the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
       than anywhere else, and asked facetiously whether <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> was the author of that passage. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he had a chance to comment on the draft of the speech and had
       looked at that particular statement but Gromyko had drafted it personally and would not
       change a word on the grounds that it represented a “scientific
       approach”. In this connection, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
       claimed that since last Fall, when the Secretary and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> drew attention to the personal attacks on the President in the Soviet
       press (Embassy's A–425),<note n="3" xml:id="d158fn3">See <ref target="#d125fn1">footnote 1, Document 125</ref>.</note> no such attacks had been published which emanated
       from Soviet official sources.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> noted the increasingly negative
       reaction of American opinion to the constant and vicious Soviet attacks on the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, and stressed that this would make an eventual normalization of
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations considerably more difficult than the
       Soviets seem to think, judging by what we hear from some of our Soviet colleagues. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> acknowledged that the situation this year is more
       difficult than last year. He said, however, that on the basis of his numerous conversations
       in Moscow he could assure Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> that
       Soviet policy toward the U.S. remains basically unchanged, although while the Vietnam
       situation lasted the Soviet posture could not be anything but what it was now. To support his
       point, he also cited the fact that the Party Congress had produced no surprises.</p>
                        <p>As he did on a previous similar occasion (Embassy's A–425), <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then criticized the U.S. unwillingness to ratify the
       consular convention or to sign the civil air agreement. The signing of the cultural exchange
       agreement was a good thing but despite the statements by the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> that it wants better relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
       it has failed to act on other measures in which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is
       interested. While the Soviet Government realizes that the President has to select his
       priorities, in view of this situation it has come to the conclusion that measures concerning
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations have no priority at all. Thus, the
       consular convention was not pushed last year, and the situation this year seems to be even
       worse. While the convention is nothing very big, it has symbolic value. As to the civil air
       agreement, even the President said it could be signed as soon as the consular convention was
       ratified. The <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0417"/>Soviet Government did not understand
       why the two were related then, and wonders what is to happen now. While a number of European
       countries, and even Japan, have entered or are willing to enter into an air agreement with
       the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> does not
       want to take even such a small step.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> explained that these were not
       purely matters of priority. Congressional figures-including those well disposed towards the
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>-have to take into account the fact that even if there
       were enough positive votes, any debate on such questions at this time would provoke a big
       argument further affecting <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he understood this but could not see how this
       applied to the civil air agreement.</p>
                        <p>In further conversation, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> confirmed the
       information the Embassy had reported earlier (Embtel 2939),<note n="4" xml:id="d158fn4">Not
        found.</note> that A.A. Soldatov, former Soviet Ambassador to the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, is now involved in policy planning work. According to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, Soldatov is to head a full-fledged Policy Planning
       Division in the Foreign Ministry, but the creation of that new office has thus far progressed
       only half-way in view of the difficulties connected with selecting and obtaining suitable
       high-caliber personnel. Viktor P. Karpov, presently Counselor at the Soviet Embassy in
       Washington, will probably be placed in charge of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> affairs in
       the new division.</p>

                        <p>To estimate main trends in Soviet internal and foreign policy over the next year or
       two.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>A. After the stormy years of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, the Soviet
       Union seems to have settled down. The new leaders have framed a number of new policies, which
       are more realistic in terms of Soviet capabilities. In general these policies are more
       conservative. Internally, the leaders are trying to tighten up; they are trying to control
       the various spontaneous forces set loose under <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. Externally, they have given first attention to problems in the
       Communist world, particularly the challenge of China. They seem fairly well satisfied with
       the results thus far, and probably intend no great change in the near future.</p>
                        <p>B. However, there are trouble spots. There are tensions between the regime and the
       intelligentsia. Economic plans are still too ambitious and their failure would sharpen the
       question of how far and fast to go with reforms, particularly in introducing the
       “profit” system. Further strains on the allocation of economic
       resources are likely to be imposed by the demands of the military and space programs, and the
       ambitious agricultural plan. Though <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> has
       emerged as the regime's leading figure, the ultimate locus of power and the manner
       of its exercise are far from settled.</p>
                        <p>C. As for foreign policy the regime has done well in isolating the Chinese and regaining
       positions in Asia lost by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, but much will
       depend on what happens in Vietnam. The Soviets probably want the war to end soon, preferably
       by negotiations. But they do not yet have this much influence in Hanoi, and they will
       probably have to stick by their present policies-continued military aid and political
       support, but limited actual Soviet involvement. <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet
       relations have been constricted by the Vietnamese war and no significant improvements are
       likely as long as the war continues.</p>
                        <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0419"/>
                        <p>D. In Europe, the Soviets will be more active, seeking to exploit de Gaulle's
       disruptive maneuvers within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. However, there is not too
       much they can do as long as their policy is fixed on the division of Germany. An
       active-policy is likely to be continued along the wide arc of countries south and east of the
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The Soviets have made progress in this area-Turkey,
       Iran, India, Pakistan, Japan-and will try to consolidate their gains at the expense of both
       China and the West.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Discussion</p>
                        <p>1. The 23rd Congress of the Soviet Party confirmed the main lines of foreign and domestic
       policy that have been gradually evolving since the fall of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. Managed in the business-like fashion which is the image cultivated
       by the new leaders, the Congress produced no spectacular surprises and no broad new
        initiatives.<note n="2" xml:id="d159fn2">The Congress met from March 29 to April 8. In
        Research Memorandum <gloss target="#t_RSB1">RSB</gloss> 45, May 13, the Bureau of
        Intelligence and Research called the meeting “a well disciplined, almost routine
        affair, pervaded with the more orthodox themes that have come to be associated with the
         post-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> leadership. There were no major
        policy innovations.” (National Archives and Records Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss> Files: Lot 71 D 273,
         <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>)</note>

       Policies,” and “Foreign Affairs.”]</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Outlook</p>
                        <p>40. While many specific policies remain unclear or even undecided, the conduct of the
       Soviet leaders does suggest the way in which, in a broad sense, they view the world and the
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s future in it. Their approach is
       increasingly realistic. They do not act as though they believe that striking gains for Soviet
       policy or Communist aspirations are available in a host of countries. They do not seize upon
       every crisis, near or remote, as an opportunity to advance their cause suddenly and
       dramatically. This is, in our view, something more than just a matter of style. Rather it
       seems to reflect a growing appreciation of the complexity of the world, the unpredictability
       of events, and the limits on Soviet ability to direct, or profit from, political change in
       foreign countries. As a result, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> may be able to
       avoid many mistakes and to operate in a sophisticated and effective fashion in areas where
       genuine opportunities exist.</p>
                        <p>41. Fundamental Soviet objectives have not been altered. They are to preserve the security
       of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and to work toward the establishment of a
       Communist world under Soviet domination. Nevertheless, the approach of the new leaders
       extends and deepens the trend which dates from the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. It contrasts
       sharply <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0420"/>with the period which preceded that crisis,
       when Soviet foreign policy seemed grounded on simpler conceptions and more extravagant
       expectations. Perhaps the chief significance of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s ouster, therefore, is that a political change of the
       first magnitude inside the country has not reversed—indeed it has
       confirmed—the Soviet tendency to temper their revolutionary outlook on the world
       with concerns of national interest and great power status.</p>

                        <p>At lunch today, I asked <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> of news of
        <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. He said that <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> had
       asked to be relieved from the Presidium because of health, as had Shvernik. He said, however,
       that <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> was present on all ceremonial occasions.
       He said he had run into Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> briefly in the
       hospital and said that she was looking fine. He said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had had some kidney trouble but had recovered.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he had had long talks with <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, and other leaders. He
       said he found the atmosphere much improved to what it had been under Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. He said he was able to express his views freely and
       frankly and was, in fact, encouraged to do so. He said his views were not always accepted,
       but there was no resentment at his expressing them. He said he had difficulty always in
       explaining statements such as that recently made by Mr. Acheson with <pb n="393" xml:id="pg_393" facs="0421"/>respect to General de Gaulle <note n="2" xml:id="d160fn2">Presumably a reference to comments made by Acheson at a Senate subcommittee hearing in
        April. As reported in <hi rend="italic">The New York Times,</hi> April 28, 1966, p. 15,
        Acheson stated that recent French policy had not drawn a picture of France as a dependable
        ally, and if Gaullist policy were to continue for a decade he speculated there would be a
        general disintegration in Western Europe, making the Soviet Union the magnet on the
        continent.</note> as the Soviet leaders could not understand that statements of this sort
       could be made without representing firm United States policy.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he had attended the meetings of the
       Central Committee as a delegate. He said there were about ten Ambassadors who attended as
       delegates and a considerable number more who were there in the lower-ranking status of
       guests. He said that <persName corresp="#p_FNT1">Fedorenko</persName> had attended as a guest
       and that it was not normal for a guest to be made a member of the Central Committee, but in
       this case, it had been decided that in view of the importance of the United Nations,
        <persName corresp="#p_FNT1">Fedorenko</persName> should be made a member of the Auditing
       Commission.</p>
                        <p>I inquired whether his being a candidate member of the Central Committee meant that he got
       any more pay. He replied, “unfortunately not,” but it did mean that he
       had more access to information about what was going on. He said because of the distance here
       from Moscow, he would probably not get all of the papers but these would be available to him
       whenever he was in Moscow.</p>
                        <p>He said that most of the members of the Presidium had not spoken at the Congress since
        <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> was speaking, and also <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, for the collective leadership. He said, however, that
       each of the members of the Presidium presided over the meetings in turn.</p>
                        <p>When I referred to the seating arrangement of the Presidium at the meetings, he pointed out
       that this varied somewhat and said that several times that Voroshilov had sat in the wrong
       place, on one occasion sitting next to <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>,
       although he clearly did not belong there.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked me if we had any ideas about what was
       going on in China. I said that we were mystified but were of the opinion that something
       important was taking place. I said that the attacks on the intellectuals seemed to be quite
       widespread and might even suggest that there were rival factions at work. He said that the
       attacks on the Soviet Union appeared to be getting increasingly vicious. He probed a bit with
       the obvious purpose of trying to find out whether Ambassador Gronouski's trip here
       meant that we were cooking something up with respect to Communist China. I said I was not
       aware of anything other than the usual repetitious go-rounds which we had with the Chinese in
       Warsaw.</p>
                        <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0422"/>
                        <p>In the course of the conversation, he observed that he was not sure that the Communist
       Chinese really wanted to get into the United Nations and I replied that my own personal
       opinion was that they did not.</p>
                        <p>I mentioned that the Chinese were apparently sending vessels to repatriate some of their
       nationals from Indonesia. He merely observed that Chinese relations with Indonesia were very
       bad.</p>

                        <p>Dear Nick:</p>
                        <p>I am sure you are aware that the Soviet Embassy has been looking for a large piece of
       property in Washington for several years to be used as the site of a new chancery. The
       Soviets contend that their present building is overcrowded, and they appear to have made a
       firm decision to move to other quarters rather than try to expand their facilities at their
       present site on 16th Street. Their inability to acquire suitable real estate has been an
       increasing irritant in our relations. Further, our Embassy in Moscow is badly overcrowded and
       far below standard, and the Soviets have refused to make property available to us for new
       buildings until their problem in Washington has been solved.</p>
                        <p>For these reasons I believe it is in our interest to assist the Soviets in finding a
       suitable chancery site. We have explored many possibilities but the only one that seems to
       offer promise is an arrangement, presently under consideration by the General Services
       Administration, under which we might offer to lease the Mt. Alto Veterans'
       Hospital site on Wisconsin Avenue near Massachusetts Avenue to the Soviets on a long-term
       basis. We would demand a site of comparable size in a comparable location in Moscow in
       return.</p>
                        <p>Before presenting this proposal to the Soviet Government I wish to be sure that Soviet
       occupancy of this property would not create an unacceptable internal security hazard. We have
       been consulting with the Department of Defense, the National Security Agency, and the Federal
       Bureau of Investigation to determine whether any major problems <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395" facs="0423"/>exist. The Department of Defense has informally agreed to our offering this
       property. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has not informed us of the existence of any
       potential security problems. The National Security Agency considers that some problems may
       exist and is studying the question further. They hope to come to a final decision quite
       soon.</p>
                        <p>I would appreciate your preliminary thoughts on the advisability, from the point of view of
       internal security, of offering this property to the Soviet Government for a chancery site in
       exchange for suitable facilities in Moscow. I believe that such a step would be in the
       national interest because it would remove an increasingly important irritant in our relations
       with the Soviet Union and it would facilitate a solution to our own critical housing problem
       in Moscow. Of course, a considerable period of time will elapse between the first discussions
       of our proposal and the beginning of any construction work on the property. An even longer
       time will pass before the site is occupied by the Soviets. During this period it would be
       possible to eliminate whatever risks to the internal security that may exist. Naturally, this
       Department is ready to cooperate with all interested agencies in this regard to the maximum
       feasible extent.</p>
                        <p>We will not discuss this possibility with the Soviets until you have studied the problem.
       However, we believe we should move quickly in order to maximize our chances of negotiating
       reciprocal arrangements in Moscow. Further, the General Services Administration cannot hold
       this surplus property for an indefinite period and a decision as to its disposal must be made
       soon. Therefore, I would very much appreciate an early reply.<note n="2" xml:id="d161fn2">Apparently the Justice Department raised no objections to the Mt. Alto site because on July

       As you know, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> wants to take a

                            <hi rend="italic">The Issue:</hi> The Soviets have asked us to permit non-Soviet Bloc ships
       under Soviet charter to enter Great Lake ports, on a scheduled basis. State recommends that
       we not agree to a scheduled service, but agree to consider individual applications.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Soviet application has merit:</p>
                        <p>—Soviet ports are open to U.S. shipping on a non-discriminatory basis;</p>
                        <p>—We have been allowing Soviet charter ships into Atlantic ports all along; there
       is no real reason for treating Great Lake ports differently;</p>
                        <p>—The ships would be manned by non-Bloc crews, and subject to security inspection
       by the Coast Guard, etc., as in the case of Bloc flag vessels calling at other U.S. ports.
       Our strict-minded Interagency Port Security Committee is ready to go ahead;</p>
                        <p>—The Great Lakes can use the business.</p>

       opponents. Sen. Douglas remembers the blown-up locks of World War I. (If we go ahead, I will
       suggest to State that they explain to him that we are talking about Western flag ships with
       Western crews.) <pb n="397" xml:id="pg_397" facs="0425"/>Hickenlooper is against because of
       Vietnam, as are Representatives Arends, Adair, Brad Morse, Selden and Laird (probably).</p>

       “perceives no objections”. (All together, State contacted 25 Members,

                        <p>On balance, I would vote for the State proposal that we tell Moscow we cannot give them a

                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>On June 17 I wrote Mike Mansfield expressing the hope that there might be a fresh look at
       the Consular Convention in view of your recent comments about the importance of building
       bridges to the East and other signs that we would like to move toward a relaxation of
       tensions <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0426"/>in our relations with the Soviet
        Union.<note n="2" xml:id="d163fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_FW1">Fulbright</persName>'s June 17 letter to <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> was forwarded to the President by <persName corresp="#p_BF1">Bator</persName> under cover of a June 21 memorandum in which <persName corresp="#p_BF1">Bator</persName> stated: “This is an odd about-face by the
        Senator. Until now, he has taken a consistently gloomy view of getting the convention
        through. His letter comes close to a damn-the-torpedoes line—and puts him on
        record as a bridge-builder (and the President on the spot.) The truth is that it would be
        bad foreign policy, as well as bad domestic politics, to take a chance, go for
        broke—and lose.”</note> I said in my letter that I knew a Senate vote
       would be close and that this might be a hard decision in an election year, but that if
        <persName corresp="#p_HJE1">J. Edgar Hoover</persName> could be persuaded to qualify his
       comments about the espionage risks he feels Soviet Consulates represent,<note n="3" xml:id="d163fn3">Reference is to <persName corresp="#p_HJE1">Hoover</persName>'s
        testimony on March 4, 1965, before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations,
        in which he stated that the establishment of new Soviet consulates would make the work of
        the <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> more difficult since it would increase Soviet
        opportunities to carry on intelligence and espionage operations.</note> if the Director of
       the Central Intelligence Agency were willing to do some quiet work in the Senate, and if
       Senator <persName corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName> could be convinced that the Convention
       was in the national interest, it would be possible for the Senate to muster the necessary
       two-thirds vote.</p>
                        <p> Mike replied in a letter of June 23<note n="4" xml:id="d163fn4">Not found.</note> that
       although he believed personally that the Convention was in the national interest and should
       be ratified, his judgment was that the Convention would lead to acrimonious debate in the
       Senate and would fail to obtain a two-thirds vote.</p>
                        <p>I know that you are firmly dedicated to the proposition that it is in the interest of the
       United States to improve relations with the Soviet Union in fields where there is a
       possibility to do so. It seems to me that the Consular Convention is clearly in our interest.
       Not only is it primarily our travelers in the Soviet Union who will be the beneficiaries but
       I would think that we would derive comparably greater intelligence benefits from opening
       consulates in the Soviet Union than the Soviets would by opening consulates here. Most
       importantly, of course, the Convention would also serve the higher purpose of improving the
       atmosphere of United States-Soviet relations at a time when such improvement is badly
       needed.</p>
                        <p>Hence, I am writing to offer you my full support in securing ratification of the
       Convention. I feel that I have a responsibility to do whatever I can to obtain a two-thirds
       majority for the Convention.</p>
                        <p>As you know, opposition to the treaty was mobilized by various conservative groups relying
       for their principal authority on statements by <persName corresp="#p_HJE1">J. Edgar
        Hoover</persName>. I cannot help but think that if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJE1">Hoover</persName> were to consider the national interest of the United States, he would
       conclude that the advantages to the United States far outweigh the fact that the <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0427"/>Federal Bureau of Investigation will be faced with the
       responsibility of controlling the activities of a few more intelligence agents.</p>
                        <p>I want you to know that I stand ready to do anything that I can do to help you on this
        matter.<note n="5" xml:id="d163fn5">A note attached to <persName corresp="#p_FW1">Fulbright</persName>'s letter, prepared by secretary Vicki McCammon, indicates
        that, upon reading the letter on July 7, the President instructed her to tell <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName> to tell <persName corresp="#p_BG1">Ball</persName>
        to go see <persName corresp="#p_FW1">Fulbright</persName> and inform him that the President,
        like <persName corresp="#p_FW1">Fulbright</persName>, wished they could get a two-thirds
        vote. <persName corresp="#p_BG1">Ball</persName> was also to tell <persName corresp="#p_FW1">Fulbright</persName> that “<persName corresp="#p_HJE1">Hoover</persName> is not
        the cause of this-nor is he [Johnson] influenced by anyone in Washington,” just
        as he assumes “<persName corresp="#p_FW1">Fulbright</persName> is not influenced
        by anyone in Washington.” A second note attached to <persName corresp="#p_FW1">Fulbright</persName>'s letter indicates that the President's wishes
        were relayed to Rostow on July 7.</note>

         <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> reported that the Soviet track and field team
        had canceled its tour of the United States because of American atrocities in Vietnam. The
        Ambassador informed Washington that he intended to protest this violation of the exchange
        agreement and tell Gromyko that “this manifest violation of formal agreement
        could not but have serious consequences for <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet
        relations.” (Telegram 161 from Moscow; ibid.) In telegram 5363, also dated July

        reaction to the bombing in North Vietnam was not serious. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. My conversation with Gromyko is reported at length separately.<note n="3" xml:id="d164fn3">Telegram 171, July 12. (Ibid.)</note> Conversation followed the general
       line of reftel as necessarily modified by course of conversation. I desire, however, to make
       a few comments. I quite agree that Soviet action in cancelling track and field meet is an
       indication that they do not intend to take serious action in response to our bombing of POL
       North Viet-Nam.<note n="4" xml:id="d164fn4">Regarding the U.S. decision in late June 1966 to
        bomb POL (petroleum, oil, and lubricants) storage installations in North Vietnam, see <ref target="frus1964-68v04#d164">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1964–1968, vol. IV, Document 164</ref>.</note>
       However, this decision <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0428"/>was taken on its own merits
       and because of limitations in possibility of response as well as their obvious decision not
       to carry things so far as to commit them to direct physical conflict with us. I do not,
       however, regard this as a reason for not taking every action we can think of to inhibit them
       from destroying exchange programs.</p>
                        <p>2. Likewise I see no relationship whatsoever between their action in connection with the
       exchange program and their decision to proceed with negotiation for a treaty on celestial
        bodies.<note n="5" xml:id="d164fn5">In a May 7 statement President Johnson had expressed the
        need for a treaty governing the exploration of celestial bodies. Four days later <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> gave Federenko an outline of points for inclusion in
        such a treaty. On June 17 the Soviet Deputy Representative to the United Nations, Platon
        Morozov, transmitted to U Thant the Soviet draft of a celestial bodies treaty. (Ibid., vol.
        XI, <ref target="#d127">Document 127</ref>) For documentation on negotiation of the treaty,
        which was signed on January 27, 1967, see ibid., volume XI.</note> It has long been clear to
       me that they will avoid any new agreements whatsoever directly with us or in which we are the
       two principal participants, so long as Viet-Nam continues, other than those involving
       compelling Soviet interests (Embtel 2920, April 5, 1965).<note n="6" xml:id="d164fn6">
                                <ref target="#d105">Document 105</ref>.</note> If they do in fact proceed to the negotiation
       of the treaty on celestial bodies and reasons will be unrelated either to Viet-Nam or to the
       exchanges agreement. Soviet leadership has a practically insoluble problem of resource
       distribution. It is clear that they are finding the burden of trying to rival us in military
       and space programs almost crushing. If they should not negotiate such a treaty, they are much
       more foolish than I believe them to be for they clearly cannot afford to engage in an arms
       race in space.</p>
                        <p>3. While I might have a shade of difference with respect to the reasoning of paragraph 2 in
       reftel, (since much of agreement could similarly be deprived of any but declaratory meaning)
       I consider it tactically sound and was careful in my discussion with Gromyko simply to read
       him the language in question which would indicate the extent of Sov Government responsibility
       and let him draw his own conclusions. Obviously he made no real distinction himself, while in
       his initial statement, he attributed the cancellation action to the feelings of the athletes.
       He did not pursue this line but rather indicated the action represented a deliberate decision
       of the Soviet Government.</p>
                        <p>4. I had a little more trouble, but tried even harder, to maintain the distinction with
       local American correspondents who pressed hard. I read to them the statement by the
       Dept's spokesman (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 5028),<note n="7" xml:id="d164fn7">Dated July 11. (National Archives and Records Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1964–66, CUL 16 <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>)</note> stressing with respect to the exchange agreement the language that
       Soviet action in our view only “violated spirit of agreement”. In
       response to further questioning, I made the distinction between contract and <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401" facs="0429"/>sub-contract, saying we were not charging violation of the
       overlying contract though the action was a clear breach of the sub-contract between the AAU
       and the Sov Sports Association.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. I have been increasingly concerned at stream of vituperation directed against us in
       Soviet press and TV, as well as at naivete and surprise this regard of many recent visitors
       to this country—including some who should know better. I am also disturbed at
       current tendency which I sense in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>—especially in
       academic and journalistic circles—to think of Soviets as “good
       guys” struggling with Chinese “bad guys” to introduce
       moderation and peacefulness into international Communist movement. This
       outlook—which ignores repeated Soviet endorsements of “wars of national
       liberation”—inescapably leads many in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
       to excuse Soviet actions re Vietnam on grounds that Kremlin leaders “cannot help
       themselves” because of their dispute with Chinese. While there is, of course,
       kernel of truth in this line of reasoning, it is harmful to us in terms of our relations with
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> because it encourages Soviets to exploit double
       standard and roundly condemn <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in most objectionable manner
       both publicly and privately and, at same time, feel confident that their efforts will be
       “understood” because situation in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>
       is “extremely complicated one.”</p>
                        <p>2. I am, therefore, viscerally sympathetic with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCA1">Bowles</persName>' suggestion that we should adopt a tougher line toward Soviet
       efforts re Vietnam. I believe this should be done by taking extreme care that no official
       statements or speeches by <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> officials contain explicit or
       implicit apology for Soviet line of action in Vietnam. Nor should we allow others to believe
       that we satisfied re Soviet “moderation” there. Thus I have been glad
       to see publicity given to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>'s <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0430"/>“put up
       or shut up” statement and to George Ball's television interview
        Monday<note n="3" xml:id="d165fn3">July 11.</note> in same vein. However, I do not believe
       that extensive and concerted propaganda campaign in all appropriate capitals and throughout
       world press, as suggested reftel, would be productive or, given present climate, necessarily
       convincing. It might even be interpreted as having ominous overtones or as evidence growing
       desperation in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> re Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>3. Despite Soviet hostility and the torrent of abuse hurled at <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, it should be kept in mind that one of realities of Vietnam situation is fact
       that Soviets thus far have been relatively cautious in avoiding any actions which could lead
       to collision with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. It is obviously in our interest not to
       back Sovs into corner—e.g. boasting re relative ineffectiveness of their
       SAM's—and thereby pressuring them to step up efforts against us in
       Vietnam. Should also be kept in mind that Sovs, to best of our knowledge, have never ascribed
       their actions Vietnam to fact that they cannot allow Chinese to be more revolutionary than
       they are. Their rationale is that they cannot leave fellow socialist country in the lurch.
       With or without Sino-Soviet dispute, Sovs would have felt obliged to provide <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, in present situation, with some form of military aid, even
       under <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. Indeed, it can be
       argued—and Soviets themselves argue it all the time and in our view quite
       convincingly—that Sino-Soviet dispute has lessened effectiveness Soviet aid to
       Vietnamese over what it would have been had Moscow been able to patch up quarrel with
       Peking.</p>
                        <p>4. Finally, I cannot endorse our hinting that Sovs may really want war between <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and China. Despite Chinese avowals that they would not call for
       Soviet support if hostilities with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> ensue, Sovs acutely
       aware that Sino-Soviet defense treaty still valid (Sovs reiterated its validity this year on
       Feb 15 anniversary of its signing—Embtel 2507).<note n="4" xml:id="d165fn4">Dated
        February 14. (National Archives and Records Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1964–66, EDU 6 <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>)</note>
       They further aware that serious threat of Sino-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> war would
       pose immense policy problems which at very least would necessarily affect their internal
       economic and military planning. It is almost truism to state that Soviet leadership not
       anxious to cope with such problems at present time, if ever.</p>

       basic relations with these countries, I do believe it important to make them aware of the

       director.</p>

                        <p>The Soviet leadership is suffering from a deep sense of frustration faced, as they are,
       with a number of intractable problems. One of the <pb n="404" xml:id="pg_404" facs="0432"/>most serious is their economic situation. Their agricultural problem is particularly
       difficult and they plan to invest some fifteen billion dollars a year over the next five
       years in this sector, the greater part of which will be a direct charge on the State budget.
       Their contract with the Canadians for nine million tons of grain over the next three years
       shows that they realize that even these enormous investments will not bring about a quick
       solution of their agricultural problem. At the same time, they have realized that their
       present system of industrial management is unsatisfactory and they are groping around for
       solutions and have cautiously embarked on a series of reforms. It is clear that their
       resources are inadequate to meet the goals they have set for themselves as long as they
       maintain their present level of military and space expenditures. Yet they do not feel able to
       cut back on their military expenditures because of their deep suspicion of us and the
       difficulty of a weak and divided leadership to carry out a cutback even if they should decide
       that this was advisable. Yet despite their heavy expenditures on arms they have at best a
       stalemate with us and are still in a position of relative inferiority. Their economic
       problems are compounded by their insistence upon the primacy of the Communist Party which
       constantly interferes in production decisions. Their need for decentralization and greater
       delegation of authority is evident but they have been unable to bring themselves to take
       serious steps in this direction for fear of undermining their own power base.</p>
                        <p>The role of the Party also exacerbates other internal problems, particularly the attitude
       of Soviet youth who no longer accept the outmoded dogma. The people as a whole demand a
       higher standard of living, and while they have yielded to this pressure by a decision to
       increase radically their automobile production, they are unable to satisfy the basic needs of
       the population. This could be accomplished only by a severe cutback in military
       expenditures.</p>
                        <p>After all of their sacrifices to establish Communism in their own country and spread it
       abroad, they find themselves locked in a bitter struggle for leadership of the Communist
       world with Communist China and engaged in a two-front cold war. They are having difficulty
       keeping their East European allies in line and their hopes for the growth of the Communist
       movement in Western Europe and in the third world have largely been thwarted. Since the
       ideology does not permit them to blame the system, whenever there is a failure heads must
       roll and it is therefore understandable that the leadership is worried.</p>
                        <p>Apart from these and other specific problems, there is the role which ideology plays in all
       Soviet Communist actions. This ideology is outdated almost to the point of absurdity and yet
       it is the basis on which they hold power. This causes two sets of problems. The first is that
       it causes them in many cases to make a false analysis of a given situation and the second is
       that it often bars them from working out a <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0433"/>rational
       solution to a given problem or at least places limits upon their freedom of action.</p>
                        <p>For example, to them Cuba was a case of American “monopoly capital”
       keeping in power a corrupt dictator in order that they could exploit the Cuban people. They
       can always find some facts to support their analysis of such situations. The Dominican affair
       fitted in with their picture of the powerful United States using force to oppose the
       aspirations of the masses. It is perhaps easier to understand the distorted picture which the
       Soviet leaders have of the world when we recognize our own tendency to oversimplify and to
       gloss over some of the weaknesses of our own case. The attempts on their part to bring some
       rationality into the ideology has been vigorously challenged by the Chinese Communists.</p>
                        <p>Against this background, the Viet-Namese affair is particularly galling to the Soviet
       leadership. They stand to lose by it in almost any outcome and they want neither the United
       States nor China to come out on top. With their ideological background, their view is the
       reverse of ours. They are concerned that if we win we will be encouraged to use force to
       suppress what they consider popular movements wherever they develop. This would undermine
       their conviction that Communism is an inevitable phase of history. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> once remarked that if Communism did not demonstrate
       its superiority and sweep the world, his life would have had no meaning. Although a real
       believer, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was far more pragmatic than the
       present leaders who are much more orthodox in their outlook. The Viet-Namese affair has also
       added to the difficulties for the leadership to resolve some of the problems mentioned above.
       It has made more difficult any cutback in military expenditure or agreement on disarmament,
       has caused a deterioration in relations with the United States and has affected trade
       relations and the possibility of obtaining foreign credits. Moreover, with the bitter
       struggle going on in the Communist world, it is particularly hard for them to be exposed as a
       paper tiger and unable to do more for a socialist country which they consider to be under
       attack by an aggressor.</p>
                        <p>I believe the Soviets recognize that we behaved reasonably well in carrying out the Laos
       agreement and I do not believe that they are responsible for what happened there, although
       they could have done more to support the settlement. In Viet-Nam, however, they point to the
       mere numbers of the Viet Cong and the staunchness of their struggle as evidence that we are,
       in effect, helping to crush a popular movement. Although this would in any event give them a
       serious problem they make a great distinction between what we do in North Viet-Nam and what
       we do in the South. I believe that we can take almost any action in the South without serious
       risk of Soviet involvement. I doubt that they will take any radical action as a result of our
       bombing of the <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0434"/>POL and interpret their cancellation
       of the visit of their track team as evidence that their reaction will be limited probably to
       some increase in the supply of military equipment. I believe, however, that any dramatic
       step-up in our action against North Viet-Nam could bring us into an area of real danger. This
       would be particularly true of action to blockade or mine North Viet-Namese harbors because of
       the parallel with Cuba and the direct confrontation which this would involve. The Soviets
       have a strong inferiority complex which causes them to overreact whenever they think their
       prestige is involved.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing is an attempt to explain Soviet actions but, of course, not to justify or
       condone them. Whatever the outcome of Viet-Nam, I am afraid it will take considerable time
       for us to get back on the path we were following in our relations with the Soviet Union when
       this affair began. In any event, we must always be aware that while an important evolution
       was taking place in the Soviet Union, which over time might have led to real coexistence, the
       Soviet leaders, as contrasted with the people, are dedicated to a dogma that is implacably
       hostile to us.</p>

                        <p>b) How serious are our losses if we make a soft reply-by accepting <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>'s formula?</p>
                        <p>c) What is the Secretary's evaluation of the effect on your peace posture at
       home and in Europe if we suspend all new activities under the exchange program?</p>
                        <p>d) Are we sure the Soviets have no come-back which would obscure their clear violation of
       the agreement?</p>
                        <p>e) Can we hold the level of retaliation at “new activities,” or do we

                        <p>To assess the short-term outlook for Soviet-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> relations,
       with particular reference to Vietnam.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Conclusion</p>
                        <p>On balance, we continue to hold the view that the men who took over from <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> almost two years ago have been conspicuous in their
       cautious approach to both foreign and domestic problems. They will go as far as they consider
       prudent in their support of Hanoi. We do not foresee either a shift to a more radical and
       venturesome line of action or initiatives toward a peaceful settlement.</p>
                        <p>1. Over the past several weeks, the Soviet government has further sharpened its attacks on
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policies in Vietnam and has taken a number of additional
       steps to chill its relations with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. These latest moves
       are clearly intended to underline Soviet condemnation of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
       bombing of POL facilities in North Vietnam early this month. The Soviets cancelled their
       participation in a sports meet in this country, at the last minute. They have refused
       permission for an American news <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0437"/>network to film
       shows in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, have staged anti-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> protest rallies in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and have in general
       been responsible for some deterioration in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet cultural
       relations. [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] in public
       statements, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has vigorously renewed its endorsement
       of Hanoi's terms for a settlement.</p>
                        <p>2. At the same time Moscow has avoided some provocative moves which it might have made. For
       example, since the spring of 1965, the Soviets have not permitted mass demonstrations against
       the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Embassy in Moscow, in contrast to recent mass protests
       in East Europe. After considerable hesitation, the Soviets agreed to permit a <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> industrial exhibit to open next month in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as scheduled, thus keeping to the letter if not the spirit of
       the new cultural exchange agreement. Berlin, that sensitive touchstone of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations, has remained quiet. Indeed, there are
       indications on Moscow's part of a desire to minimize the chances for friction
       there, e.g., it has acted to expedite the movement of Allied traffic into West Berlin.
       Despite the lack of progress, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> continues to
       participate in the Geneva disarmament talks and Soviet officials in Geneva have in recent
       weeks showed serious interest in negotiating a treaty governing space exploration.</p>
                        <p>3. These contradictory manifestations indicate the growing complexities of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s position in regard to Vietnam, its relations
       with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, and its position in the Communist world. The
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has made important gains in its contest with Peking by
       supporting Hanoi and calling upon all Communist countries to participate in joint action to
       aid the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. In order to maintain this improved position they
       must continue to support Hanoi, and, at the same time, disprove the endless Chinese charges
       of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet “collusion.” For these
       reasons, they remain unwilling at present to take any initiatives to bring about a negotiated
       settlement. But the Soviets have shown themselves keenly aware of the dangers of escalation
       and reluctant to become deeply involved in the war. These attitudes have placed important
       limits on Soviet reactions to events in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>4. As a result of this dilemma, the Soviets, in order to register their disapproval of
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy, have turned to such well advertised areas of
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations as cultural exchanges. The Soviet leaders
       recognize that the publicized sector of relations is an area especially vulnerable to Chinese
       attack. By the same token, the Soviets also recognize that they can attract the most dramatic
       publicity when bilateral exchanges and contacts are abruptly cut off. Moreover, <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet exchanges in general may be under something of a cloud in
       the Soviet leadership because of the concern it has manifested recently over its control of
       the Soviet intellectuals. Thus, for internal Soviet reasons, as well as because of the
       Vietnamese war, certain areas of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet cooperation are
       likely to suffer. In sum, a generally hostile climate between the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is likely to continue for some
       time.</p>
                        <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0438"/>
                        <p>5. Indeed, it may get worse. Thus far, Soviet policymakers have confined their actions to
       those areas of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations which are secondary and
       presumably expendable. But further developments could impel the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to adopt more radical measures. The crucial question, of course, is whether
       the worsening in relations will be reflected in some new and dangerous Soviet action in
       Vietnam or elsewhere. Moscow's inability to influence thus far the course of
       events in Vietnam, pressures from North Vietnam for more effective assistance, and the
       contest with China for influence in Hanoi and elsewhere, are all factors which could cause
       the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to consider actions which it has thus far
       avoided.</p>
                        <p>6. We continue to believe, however, that despite uncertainty and apprehension concerning
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policies, Soviet leaders see no realistic alternative to
       continuing their present course of action. The Soviets probably still have no clear idea of
       how the Vietnamese war will develop. They appear to be intent on limiting their own risks and
       we think that they will try to maintain this policy. But while we can be fairly confident of
       the policy the Soviet Union prefers and will try to pursue, there are still forces at play
       which could draw Soviet policy onto a course of greater risk.</p>
                        <p>7. As <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military pressure on Hanoi increases, Soviet
       actions might be intensified with more overt participation of personnel or improvement of
       defense weapons systems. Because of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s
       present involvement in the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>'s air defense, this
       is a special area of responsibility for Moscow. Up to now, the Russians have not emphasized
       their role in Hanoi's air defense. However, if this system continues to prove
       relatively ineffective, the Russians might be called upon to supply the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> regime with more assistance, such as MIG–21s, improved radar,
       or more technical and advisory Soviet personnel.</p>
                        <p>8. Moscow has recently revived its earlier pledges to send
       “volunteers” to support Hanoi if requested. Such statements, made
       jointly with Warsaw Pact allies, seem primarily intended to undercut Peking's
       charges of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet “collaboration” and
       to highlight China's isolation, though the Russians may also hope that the move
       will have a deterrent effect on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> actions in Vietnam.
       Privately, some Soviet officials have gone out of their way in conversations with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to disclaim any intention of actually sending volunteers.
       However, it is just this sort of tactic which illustrates Moscow's continuing
       dilemma in Vietnam. If Hanoi did eventually call for such support, although <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> has recently said such a move was unnecessary, the
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would probably send additional technical personnel and
       declare their presence openly. Even then, the Soviet leaders would try to avoid the
       appearance of direct <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet combat.</p>

         <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> refused to accept it in view of its
        “abusive language.” (Telegram 609 from Moscow, August 5; National

        1964–66, POL 15–1 <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>)</note> But we can see no
       qualitative change in the Soviet policy lines already evident for some time: aid, probably
       increasing in quantity, to North Vietnam; diplomatic and propaganda pressure to get us to
       desist or at least to deter us from escalating; no initiative toward a peaceful settlement
       unless and until Hanoi gives the green light; nevertheless keep in touch with us on issues
       such as outer space and nonproliferation and on selected bilateral problems such as
       fisheries.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets seem to be confident that they can continue along these tracks with some
       profit, though we think some of their recent tough talk reflects worry over our further plans
       in Vietnam. Curiously enough, they also seem worried about <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Chinese Communist collusion, though their recent emphasis on this is in large
       part intended to rebut Chinese charges against them.</p>
                        <p>The troublesome thing about how <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> and

       seem to have thought much beyond current profit to the time when their willingness to hitch

       present involvement in some of Hanoi's air defense. Perhaps the time has come to

                        <p>Dear Cy:</p>
                        <p>The growing number of encounters between U.S. and Soviet ships and aircraft gives us
       increasing concern over the possibility of a serious incident which in the context of our
       current relationship with the Soviet Union could have serious political repercussions. As
       Soviet vessels become involved or involve themselves in our increasing operations off
       Viet-Nam, the risk of a serious incident inevitably increases. However, our concern is not
       confined just to the Vietnamese area.</p>
                        <p>For your own background I am enclosing a copy of a list of recent incidents which I had
       prepared on the basis of information available to us here.<note n="2" xml:id="d171fn2">Not
        printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>We have also studied the Rules of Engagement now in effect and they seem to us to be
       generally satisfactory. It seems that the Soviet rules are probably similar to our own, but
       the occasional dangerously close Soviet approaches to our aircraft and ships give us concern
       that Soviet personnel may exercise considerable latitude in the interpretation of their own
       instructions. It is also clear that situations arise in which “tests of
       will” take place between relatively junior officers on both sides, in the course
       of which the temptation to “shade” their instructions is undoubtedly
       very strong.</p>
                        <p>I have no solution to offer but suggest that when incidents do occur, you will want to
       satisfy yourself that the investigation on our part does not become just routine but that we
       thoroughly satisfy ourselves that our Commanders are rigidly adhering to their instructions
       in these <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0441"/>matters of such great moment. I would also
       be glad to consider any suggestions that you may have for a broad approach to the Soviets on
       this question or any other suggestions that you may have.<note n="3" xml:id="d171fn3">

        memorandum (see footnote 1 above), after making the recommendation <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> “then asked that it be held up because of
        troubles with the Soviet Union over the track meet, our cultural agreement,

       you know, he has stated that the chances of early Soviet agreement are “slightly
       under 50–50”, but that we should proceed now to advise the Soviets of our

                        </p>
                        <p>The Bureau of European Affairs concurs with the Ambassador's views and notes
       that after five years delay in signing the Agreement, its use as a bargaining item has long
       since become counter-productive; that maximum usefulness from the Agreement is obtainable in
       the present context—as a sweetener in a prolonged stand-off situation. Soviet
       rejection or procrastination to an overture would not be disadvantageous, although this of
       course is not our objective.</p>
                        <p>In the present world situation and following the signing of the Canadian-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> Agreement, there is a reasonable likelihood that other
       Governments will not misconstrue or overreact to an American initiative in this field.
       Assistant Secretary Gordon reports that there are no new factors in the Latin American sphere
       that need to be noted since the Secretary made his recommendation on July 15.</p>
                        <p>When last consulted earlier this summer, Pan American Airlines, the American carrier which
       would carry out the Agreement on our side, felt that flights to Moscow would probably not be
       profitable for some time to come, but on balance saw some advantage in serving Moscow. After
       the Agreement is signed, Pan Am would probably wish to have discussions with the Soviet
       carrier, Aeroflot, regarding intermediate stops, to improve profits of the operation. We are
       not aware of what the Soviet attitude would be to such a request except for a
       not-discouraging Soviet response to informal mention of this possibility by Juan Trippe in
       Moscow last June.</p>
                        <p>In one regard there is more justification for implementation of the Agreement now (for the
       1967 tourist season) than when it was negotiated and initialled in 1961. Over 20,000
       Americans now visit the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> each year; many would be
       convenienced by implementation of such an agreement.</p>
                        <p>We have not made a formal effort to obtain the views of various agencies of the U.S.
       Government or various parts of the Department since 1963. At that time the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> objected, but the Department of Defense overruled the Chiefs
       and interposed no objection to the Agreement. The <gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CAB1">CAB</gloss>, and the Department of Commerce expressed no opposition. We
       know that the <gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss> would now like to make one relatively small
       technical change in the separate “Agreed Minute” but this <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415" facs="0443"/>can probably be done fairly simply and need not be a
       preliminary requirement for signing the Agreement.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of the foregoing the Secretary has suggested that we propose to the President
       that he authorize the Department of State to consult immediately with interested
       Congressional leaders, including Senators <persName corresp="#p_FW1">Fulbright</persName>,
       Hickenlooper, MAGNUSON, and Monroney. If Congressional attitudes seemed to warrant it, we
       would then request highest level authorization to permit us to instruct Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> to inform the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our
       interest in proceeding with the signing of the Agreement and suggesting that this be done by
       Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in New York at the time of the convening of the General
        Assembly.<note n="5" xml:id="d172fn5">In his September 1 memorandum Rostow gave Johnson
        three options in response: “Permit State to consult Congressional
        Leaders,” “Disapprove,” and “See me.”
        The latter was checked. Written in an unidentified hand at the top of Rostow's
        memorandum is, “Why do Joint Chiefs of Staff object?” In a September 3
        memorandum to Johnson, Rostow summarized the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> objections
        as stated in 1963 and the Department of State's response and proposed a Tuesday
        lunch meeting with <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to “walk around this once more before
        instructing Sect. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> to begin Congressional
        consultations.” (Johnson Library, National Security File, Memos to the
         President—<persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt W. Rostow</persName>, Vol. 12) No
        record of the luncheon meeting on September 6 has been found, but on September 12 <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> informed the President that the consultations with
        Congressional leaders had found general support for signing the agreement. (Memorandum to
        the President; National Archives and Records Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, <gloss target="#t_SS1">S/S</gloss> Files: Lot 74 D 164) The following day

                        <p>1263. Ref: State's 41009, 44806; Moscow's 1182.<note n="2" xml:id="d173fn2">Dated September 2, 10, and 9, respectively. (Ibid.) They all discussed
        preparations for a meeting between <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> at the United Nations.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. I saw <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> today and told him of
       Secretary's interest in resuming talks with him while both were in New York, and
       also indicated <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416" facs="0444"/>that Secretary would be pleased to
       arrange hospitality if <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> wished to visit any
       other part of U.S. I said that our missions in New York had already talked about the
       possibility of a meeting and, if <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> agreed to
       meeting, they could make necessary arrangements.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he had received word about this and
       that he of course agreed in principle. He had not given matter much thought but would think
       about it and let me know before I left Moscow on Thursday or send word back through the
       mission in New York. He asked if I could tell him what subjects Secretary would want to
       discuss. I noted that our missions had already talked about possible subjects, and that
       Secretary had in mind a tour d'horizon which obviously would include Viet Nam,
       various disarmament questions, bilateral matters, and of course anything <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> wished to raise.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that, on Viet Nam, he should mention
       again that Soviets were not going to negotiate with anyone on this matter; this did not mean
       they could not speak about their position, or hear other side, but they would not negotiate
       or do anything analogous to it (obviously implying that there should be no press stories
       alleging <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet negotiations on Viet Nam). I replied that
       as much as we wished they would change their position, we nevertheless understood it at this
       point and had no desire to put him on the spot.</p>
                        <p>4. When <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked if we had in mind a purely
       exploratory exchange of views, I told him it seemed possible to me that we could move a
       little farther on some matters and singled out outer space (depending on progress in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> legal committee), non-proliferation, and comprehensive test ban.
       Mention of non-proliferation set in train an exchange of familiar arguments about whether
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> really desired non-proliferation, in course of which
        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he had not detected any narrowing of
       wide gap between our two positions at Geneva talks. He did however express interest when I
       referred to President's statement on need for
        “compromise”<note n="3" xml:id="d173fn3">While discussing the
        non-proliferation treaty during his remarks at the National Reactor Testing Station in Arco,
        Idaho, on August 26, the President said “I believe that we can find acceptable
        compromise language on which reasonable men can agree.” Johnson also expressed
        his desire to seek out all possible areas of agreement with the Soviet Union despite
        differences over Vietnam. For text, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of
         the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>, 1966,</hi>
        Book II, pp. 900–903. For documentation on the negotiation of the non-proliferation treaty,
        see <ref target="frus1964-68v11">

       there were any specificity in our position on this. I said there was none yet but that we
       were thinking about how we could close gap between us. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> commented that since President had not specified what he had in mind, it
       was not clear how progress could be made.</p>
                        <pb n="417" xml:id="pg_417" facs="0445"/>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> complained at one point that although it
       was sometimes agreed in his discussions with Secretary that further talks should be held on
       one or another subject, none of these matters were ever permitted to come to fruition.
       Mentioning disarmament as one example, I said that while I did not want to provoke argument
       today on this point, it was nevertheless Soviet side which took position that Viet Nam was
       barrier to solution of bilateral and other questions between <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Soviets who spoke of “freeze” in our relations. I said
       it was regrettable that there were such differences between us as Viet Nam but <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Govt had consistently maintained that special responsibility lay
       with our two powers and we should continue to try to make progress despite Viet Nam. I said
       in this connection that I was sure that he had read President's Idaho Falls
        speech,<note n="4" xml:id="d173fn4">See <ref target="#d173fn3">footnote 3</ref>
        above.</note> which was addressed to them; and that, as he knew, I had personally always
       felt that we should do what we could to move forward.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> countered that contrary to what we say it
       was <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in fact which had blocked final implementation, for
       example, of consular convention and air agreement. While he did not attach great importance
       to these issues, they had a certain importance and even on these minor matters we had stopped
       progress. I said I frankly recognized that these matters had not gone forward as had been
       expected but this was not cause but result of development in our relations.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said they had impression that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had two policies, or at least two methods of conducting them,
       with respect to Soviet Union. On one hand, we tried to give impression that we were dealing
       with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and trying to reach agreement with them; and on
       other hand we conducted highly negative policies which only served to raise tensions. This,
       he said, created very difficult situation.</p>
                        <p>8. I told <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> I could not agree with this
       description. Soviets had their alliances and had made promises to some of its allies, and we
       also had obligations to many of our allies. Fact that we had to keep these obligations was
       fact of life but did not mean that we should not try to move ahead wherever we could.</p>
                        <p>9. During discussion disarmament, I said I thought some progress had been made at least in
       bringing language closer together, and that in fact I had always thought our purposes here
       were same. It had never been our purpose to give nuclear weapons to Germany or to any other
       state. We had not made same mistake, I said that Soviets had made in furnishing assistance to
       Communist China. If he wanted testimony to our position, he should study history of our
       refusal to help France which had cost us dearly in other ways. In any event, I said, there
       had <pb n="418" xml:id="pg_418" facs="0446"/>been a change in situation following Chinese
       explosions which resulted in pressures in India and other countries for them to develop their
       own nuclear capability.</p>
                        <p>10. At end of conversation, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked if
       Secretary had been specific about visit to “any other part of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>” which had been mentioned. I said he had not, but
       assumed he had in mind whether <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would wish to
       come down to Washington or travel anywhere else in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> as he
       might wish. He took note of reference to Washington but went on to comment that he was not a
       great traveler.</p>
                        <p>11. In reply to my query, he said Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would
       accompany him to New York but said official delegation had not yet been approved.<note n="5" xml:id="d173fn5">On September 14 <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> reported that
        he had lunched with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that day for a

        the substance of the conversation was largely repetitive of that with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. (Telegram 1280 from Moscow, September 14; National

       believed the details of the civil air agreement could be worked out during October and that

       Outer Space Agreements.” In addition, “there was some closing of the
       gap in non-proliferation language” but “we are not home on

                        <p>I think it is clear from your talks with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in
       New York<note n="2" xml:id="d175fn2">See <ref target="#d174">Document 174</ref>.</note> that
       the Soviets will not let Viet-Nam prevent them from proceeding with the Civil Air Agreement,
       technical talks on peaceful uses of atomic energy, and probably also with an agreement on
       outer space along the lines of our proposals. I am less sanguine about non-proliferation, but
       I suspect that the Soviets have the same information as we do about tendencies in India. This
       must worry them because if India took the nuclear route, Pakistan would surely be pushed much
       deeper into the Chinese Communist embrace.</p>
                        <p> Ray Garthoff tells me that a German official recently privately expressed to him the
       opinion that the German Government could be brought to give up a hardware solution provided
       we could maintain the European clause in any agreement. This official's reasoning
       was that if European unity did come about, the Germans would not want to be committed to a
       position inferior to that of the French. I think that if we were able to accept treaty
       language that would bar a German hardware solution, we could probably sell the Soviets on a
       European clause.</p>
                        <p>Although there was nothing in the <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> talks that
       seemed very significant except the mild tone and their willingness to conclude some
       agreements with us, I am convinced from other information available to us that their main
       preoccupation is the internal situation in Communist China. It seems clear from the recent
       report from Belgrade that this is the chief question <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> had on his mind in his recent visits to Eastern Europe. We have good
       reason to believe that the Eastern Europeans would like to see a Viet-Namese settlement and
       are doubtless pushing the Soviets to take some action in this direction.</p>
                        <p>
                            <pb n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0448"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s emphasis in his U.N. speech on
       the importance of Europe doubtless reflects the real Soviet attitude but was probably made at
       this time to put the Viet-Namese problem in better perspective. It is difficult to assess
       what effect a settlement in Viet-Nam would have on Sino-Soviet relations. Whatever the terms,
       the Chinese would doubtless accuse the Soviets of a sellout. One of the most important Soviet
       pre-occupations must surely be what their position will be in North Viet-Nam after a
       settlement. If Peking continues on its present course, the Soviets may have less concern
       about their influence relative to that of China in Hanoi after a settlement. In any event,
       the Soviets cannot enjoy the growing burden of aid to Viet-Nam nor the continued risk that
       developments might lead to a confrontation with the United States or at least a very painful
       dilemma in the event of a conflict between the United States and Peking. Because the Soviets
       do not want to get too far in front of Hanoi and because Hanoi probably is awaiting the
       outcome of our elections before making any policy changes, I doubt if anything can be
       accomplished right now, but after the elections I am inclined to think that in the event of
       another bombing pause, the Soviets would bring considerable pressure on Hanoi.</p>

                        <p>On October 7, 1966, President Johnson delivered an address before the National Conference
       of Editorial Writers in New York on steps to improve East-West relations. For text of the
       speech as delivered, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United
        States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>, 1966,</hi> Book II, pages
       1125–1130. The Embassy in Moscow reported in telegram 1802, October 16, on the negative
       Soviet reaction to the President's speech, particularly as expressed by <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Leonid Brezhnev</persName> in an October 15 speech: “While
        <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> avoided any such terms as
       ‘hypocrisy’ or ‘insincerity,’ and while he
       observed in passing <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> also wants mutually beneficial
       U.S.-Soviet relations, his line is hard and biting and accords with initial Sov press comment
       on President's speech, i.e., main prerequisites for development such relations are
       cessation U.S. ‘aggression’ in Vietnam and abandonment by U.S. of its
       alleged interventionism in general. According to him, President's
       ‘attempt’ suggest U.S. relations with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and other socialist states can develop unimpeded despite U.S. aggression
       Vietnam and interference in affairs other states is a ‘strange and pernicious
       delusion.’”</p>
                        <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0449"/>
                        <p>The telegram concluded, however, that <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s failure to deal with the specific proposals in the
       President's speech probably reflected the “basic
       predicament” the Soviets were in as a result of their negative stance on the
       development of U.S.-Soviet relations and their interest in certain specific steps, such as
       the civil aviation agreement. <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s
       negative reaction should be interpreted as a “go slow” signal rather
       than as an outright rejection of those steps in which the Soviet Union had a strong interest.

                        <p>The following are the principal objectives of your meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>:</p>
                        <p>1. To add one more step to the many we have taken to convince the Soviets and the rest of
       the world that we are leaving no stone unturned in our search for peace in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>2. To exacerbate the Sino-Soviet quarrel. (The mere fact that you receive <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> will doubtless lead to Chinese charges against the
       Soviets of collusion with the U.S.)</p>
                        <p>3. To demonstrate to the Soviets that despite Viet-Nam, we are not only willing, but
       desirous of taking steps that will ease tension.</p>
                        <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0450"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Talking Points</p>
                        <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Viet-Nam.</hi> You may wish to tell <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that you have been fully informed of his talks with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and that you do not propose to repeat the statement of our
       position which is well known to him. There are, however, several points which you may wish to
       underscore:</p>
                        <p>1. First of all is your sincere desire for a peaceful settlement. You have taken every
       feasible step to move matters towards negotiation for a settlement or, pending that, for a
       reciprocal reduction in military activity. You have noted Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s statement to the effect that every time we made a peaceful
       move we also took actions or made statements indicating a further American involvement. Such
       actions do not indicate bad faith on our part. They were previously planned and considered
       necessary only in view of the total lack of response from the other side.</p>
                        <p>2. We would be quite prepared to discuss what action each side might take to diminish the
       level of hostilities, but how can we do this when Hanoi will not talk to us in a conference,
       directly, or through third parties? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had
       suggested certain actions by us to establish a climate for a settlement but actions are
       needed on both sides to increase mutual confidence.</p>
                        <p>3. We will be grateful for anything the Soviets may be able to do to enable us to reach a
       peaceful settlement of this problem.</p>
                        <p>4. If Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> again urges unilateral U.S.
       actions, you may wish to note that the Soviets do not seem to have given us credit for having
       given up in advance one of our major negotiating assets; namely, we have made clear in
       advance our willingness to withdraw our troops and to give up the military bases which we
       have constructed in South Viet-Nam at enormous cost. In return for this, there has never been
       any concession from the other side.</p>
                        <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Non-proliferation.</hi> Depending upon the status of <persName corresp="#p_FWC1">Foster</persName>'s continuing talks you may wish to emphasize
       our desire to overcome the remaining differences between us on the text of an agreement. It
       seems to us that as far as our objectives in non-proliferation are concerned we have a wide
       area of agreement. We do not intend to turn our weapons over to any other nation.
       Responsibility for firing U.S. weapons rests with the President under our law and policy, and
       there is no prospect that this will or can be changed. However, we do not wish to undertake
       treaty obligations which would commit us to act as if no alliance of a collective security
       nature exists with our allies. We cannot say to them that collective security within the
       alliance is none of their business. We have gone a long way in seeking to reach compromise
       language with the Soviet Union and we do not believe that any real Soviet concerns would be
       affected by the language which we have <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423" facs="0451"/>proposed.
       Time is running out on this subject. We should therefore seek to resolve the remaining
       differences.</p>
                        <p>C. <hi rend="italic">Communist China.</hi> You might wish to see whether <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> will be disposed to discuss this subject by touching on
       the following points:</p>
                        <p>1. We are amazed and puzzled by what appears to be going on in Communist China. The turmoil
       there will surely increase the difficulty the Chinese are encountering in feeding their
       enormous population.</p>
                        <p>2. These events are cause for concern which the Soviet Government may share. In particular
       we hope that the chaotic conditions in China will not tempt the Chinese to divert attention
       by military adventures. For our part, we will take no action which could legitimately serve
       as a pretext for such a dangerous course.</p>
                        <p>D. <hi rend="italic">Germany.</hi> It seems unlikely that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> will raise this as a separate subject. He will, of course, express the
       traditional Soviet views on Germany in the context of his remarks on non-proliferation. He
       might argue for admission of the so-called German Democratic Republic into the United
       Nations, although this is doubtful.</p>
                        <p>E. <hi rend="italic">Outer Space Treaty.</hi> On October 4 the Soviets accepted two of our
       important compromise proposals and, for other treaty clauses such as that relating to the
       granting of tracking facilities, put forward compromise language of their own. This Soviet
       movement has brought us closer to a treaty, though several problems remain to be worked out
       and our allies need time to react. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>
       is making an intensive effort to wrap up all of the major treaty points. If substantial
       agreement has been reached by October 10, you may want to express satisfaction; otherwise you
       might hope for a speedy conclusion.</p>
                        <p>F. <hi rend="italic">Civil Air Agreement.</hi> We have prepared and the Soviets have agreed
       that Pan American send a small group to Moscow to review and update the agreement between the
       two airlines preparatory to the signing of the inter-governmental agreement here. We
       understand that General Loginov, the Soviet Minister of Aviation, will come here in early
       November for the signing. We are currently studying a few amendments proposed by the Soviets
       and are proposing a few minor, technical changes of our own.</p>
                        <p>G. <hi rend="italic">Consular Agreement and Trade Expansion.</hi> You may also wish to
       express an intention of pressing for the ratification of the Consular Agreement and for
       Congressional action which would facilitate the expansion of trade.</p>
                        <p>H. <hi rend="italic">Fisheries Problem.</hi> You may wish to express the hope that the
       U.S.-Soviet talks which will resume next month on the problem caused by the Soviet fishing
       fleet currently massed off our Northwest Coast will result in a reduction of the tensions
       this problem is creating for us.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the leadership and the Government of
       the Soviet Union often discussed the question of where the policy of the United States is
       leading. He presumed that there was an awareness of the responsibility of the United States
       and of the Soviet Union in world affairs. However, certain facts related to United States
       policy baffled the Soviets. He could declare on behalf of the Soviet Union that it was in our
       mutual interest to work for better relations. If the United States Government and Mr.
       Johnson, as President, were willing to take steps to promote international détente
       to improve relations, they would not find the Soviet Union lacking in response as this was in
       accord with the wishes of both the Soviet Government and its people.</p>
                        <p>The President said he agreed with the points Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had made. We were just as baffled about the foreign policy of the Soviet
       Union. It was evident that we had not communicated with each other very well. He also agreed
       that agreement between our two great powers was of the highest importance and that we had a
       great responsibility to the world. He had on many occasions tried to take steps to ease
       tension. He had been greatly encouraged in the correspondence that had taken place during his
       early months in office. He had been deeply disappointed that the keeping of our commitment to
       South Viet-Nam seemed to frustrate these early beginnings. He had been distressed to read in
       the Soviet press remarks about himself personally and about the motivation of his
       Administration. He knew that the Soviet and American people wanted friendship and he was
       always ready to go more than half way to reach agreement. The greatest reward to him as
       President, and the greatest blessing for all people, would be if we could succeed in this
       endeavor.</p>

                        <p>Following a private talk between the President and the Foreign Secretary, the President
       invited the group to walk with him around the White House grounds.</p>
                        <p>In the course of the conversation, the President spoke of the present state of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations, saying that he felt some progress was being
       made. He noted that we had a cultural agreement with the Soviet Union, that there was
       agreement that a civil air accord should be signed in the near future, negotiations on
       fisheries were proceeding, and the prospects were encouraging for a treaty on outer space.
       Both sides seemed to be working seriously on finding compromise language for a
       non-proliferation treaty. In general, the President said, he felt that our relations with the
       Soviet Union were better at present than they have ever been since he assumed the
       Presidency.</p>
                        <p>The President recalled his recent talk with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d180fn2">See <ref target="#d178">Documents 178</ref>
        and <ref target="#d179">179</ref>.</note> This had been frank and useful. So far as Viet-Nam
       was concerned, the principal change he detected in the Soviet position was that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had indicated that the Soviets now have some influence
       in North Viet-Nam and that, if the bombing were to cease, there was reason to hope that this
       would be followed by positive action on the part of the North. Previously, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had only urged us to stop the bombing and then we would
       see what would happen.</p>

                            </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>I have the following observations on the discussions which you and the President had with
       Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>:<note n="2" xml:id="d181fn2">See <ref target="#d178">Documents 178</ref> and <ref target="#d179">179</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>You will note that contrary to custom, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
       did not begin the conversation by expressing the greetings of the Soviet leadership, but
       waited until the conversation was over. My guess is that this was deliberate and that he
       wanted first to see how the conversation went. Apparently he considered it sufficiently
       satisfactory to transmit the greetings.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me the essence of the conversation with the President was that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> admitted the Soviet Union had influence in Hanoi and
       that by implication they would exercise this influence if we stopped bombing. He also flatly
       stated that the reaction of Hanoi would be different, obviously referring to the reaction to
       the last pause. On the other hand, this was qualified, it seems to me, by the fact that Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> indicated that our last cessation of bombing
       was not successful because it was conditional. He pointed out that a number of countries knew
       that it was a pause and not a cessation and that we were waiting to see what the other side
       did. It therefore seems to me that a Soviet commitment to do something about a cessation is
       qualified by the indication that the pause should be unconditional and indefinite.</p>
                        <p>I think it was striking that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> avoided all
       polemics and was most careful not, in any way, to antagonize the President. He made the flat
       statement that the Soviet Union wished to improve relations which is a considerable change
       from their recent standard line which is that this could only happen after Viet-Nam was
       settled.</p>
                        <p>There are two points that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> made in the
       conversation which I think we could successfully pursue for the purpose of clarification. At
       one point, after referring to the bombing pause, he said that this had been accompanied by
       conditions known to be unacceptable to the other side as the other side would have to
       capitulate. I am not <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0457"/>clear just what he had in mind.
       The other remark was that we had not been sufficiently specific about our troop withdrawal.
       We might explore just what specific points he had in mind. Was it timing, for example, or
       perhaps the conditions we would require or what.</p>
                        <p>It is also striking that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> only made one
       remark which could be implied as a threat and that was that if the United States widened the
       war, the Soviet Union would give further aid to the Viet-Namese and both the United States
       and the Soviet Union would find themselves drawn into these events.</p>
                        <p>It seems clear from all of the talks with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
       that the Soviet Union professes, and I believe genuinely, to wish to see a settlement of the
       Viet-Namese affair. Moreover, they are apparently prepared to reach at least some agreements
       with us and improve relations despite Viet-Nam. This is somewhat a change of position. The
       following occur to me as possible explanations:</p>
                        <p>In the first place, the deterioration of the Chinese Communist position in the Communist
       Bloc has meant that the Soviet Union is less concerned that actions to improve relations will
       expose them to effective Chinese attacks within the Bloc. In the second place, they must be
       genuinely worried about the chaotic situation inside Communist China and would like better
       relations with us not only in the event of unforeseen contingencies but also to deter us from
       any inclination we might have to get together with Communist China in opposition to the
       Soviet Union. An additional factor may be that from their point of view things are going well
       for them in Western Europe and they may think they can speed up the disintegration of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and promote troop withdrawals by being in a posture of better
       relations with the West. A further factor may be the upcoming fiftieth anniversary of the
       Revolution next year. The Soviets are preparing to put on quite a show and I believe would
       like a situation in which many Westerners will be present to hear their boasts of their
       progress.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the Soviets probably consider that a posture of improved relations will help bring
       pressure on us for agreements they would like to achieve, such as a non-proliferation
        treaty.<note n="3" xml:id="d181fn3">In an October 17 meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>

       stemming from his recent trip to Moscow.<note n="2" xml:id="d182fn2">Senator MAGNUSON was in
        Moscow September 30–October 4. He met with the Minister of Fisheries, an official of the
        Ministry of Trade, and an official of the Academy of Sciences. Reports of his meetings were
        transmitted in airgrams A–573 and A–574, October 7; a summary report of his visit is in
        airgram A–575, October 11. (Airgrams A–573 and A–575; ibid., LEG 7 MAGNUSON; A–574; ibid.,
        FT <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>)</note> He thought that his contacts with the Soviet
       Fisheries people in Moscow demonstrated an awareness on their part of the importance of
       withdrawing their current fishing activities off the West Coast if other relations were to
       improve. All the Soviet people he had met seemed to be interested in improved East-West
       trade. The Senator had been frank to indicate that prospects for increased East-West trade
       would be harmed if the fishing problem remained unsolved.</p>
                        <p>The Senator said that, as the father of the East-West Trade Bill, he had to say that the
       bill could not move forward through the Congress next year if the Soviet fishing activities
       off the West Coast continued unchecked.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> said that in the talks with the
       Soviets in New York last week, he had at least twice stressed to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that it was important that these matters be taken care of. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had indicated he understood.</p>
                        <p>Senator MAGNUSON emphasized that it was a human political problem, as the people of
       Washington could stand on the shore and see Soviet fishing fleets offshore. The Soviets were
       getting a minimal catch that was just a drop in the bucket to their global take, and they
       would be foolish to continue to irritate Americans in this way. There had been <pb n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0459"/>one or two shots fired already; unless it was stopped there
       could be serious violence between fishermen. Sport fishermen were also annoyed at the Soviet
       presence, and blamed any bad fishing on that. The Soviets also are taking hake, at the same
       time that the Congress has appropriated funds for a hake reduction plant in Washington. The
       Senator passed around a sample of the full page publicity this was receiving in Washington
       papers.</p>
                        <p>He said that he had not tried to connect this problem with the upcoming King Crab talks
       when he was in Moscow, a tactic which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> approved. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>
       suggested that the Soviets probably realize the little gain and great risk involved in this
       operation, but might be slow to agree not to fish offshore, since they might wish to use this
       as a bargaining point again and again. On the other hand, their conduct might change soon, a
       possibility Dobrynin had indicated.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Grinstein said he would be going to Moscow for the technical talks in November that
       were scheduled, but that the research by U.S. fishing interests was as yet inadequate to
       establish damage by the Soviet operations. He wondered if he should call the talks off, or
       postpone them. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> said that the
       Russians would read too much into either a postponement or cancellation and suggested that
       the talks go forward as scheduled, even if our evidence was by no means conclusive.</p>
                        <p>The Senator said that he was glad that he was able to get Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>'s views, since Mr. Mann's
       departure had left him without a focal point on the fishing question. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> said that Mr. Rostow had been asked by the Secretary
       to supervise all fisheries matters.</p>
                        <p>The Senator again stressed the important connection between clearing up the West Coast
       fisheries problem of close inshore Soviet commercial fishing, if the East-West Trade Bill was
       to move. He would be seeing the President on both these subjects Sunday night and would speak
       to him along these lines.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> again stressed the recognition
       we gave to the importance of the problem, and the fact that we would continue to press this
       on the Soviet representatives. He hoped Mr. Grinstein would pass on the results of his
       November talks.</p>

                        <p>At dinner last night, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he would like
       some personal advice. He said that President Johnson had referred, in passing, to the private

                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had asked <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> whether he thought it would be a good idea to start up this channel

       advice should be and wondered if I could give him my own views.</p>
                        <p>I replied that I thought this channel should not be used either for the normal conduct of
       regular business between the two governments nor to argue out standard positions of the two
       sides on disputed issues such as Viet-Nam. I thought it best that it be reserved for
       occasions when something constructive could be accomplished or when there was some
       explanation of policy or actions which were not readily apparent from formal

                        <p>I am concerned about the impression the Soviet leadership may get from our inaction on the
       non-proliferation treaty and what I would gather are contemplated actions in Viet-Nam.<note n="2" xml:id="d184fn2">A reference to proposals to expand the air war against North Vietnam;

                        <p>The Soviets have made a great point on non-proliferation as an indicator of our over-all
       intentions. While I do not suggest we should abandon our fundamental position, I do think our
       backing away from further discussion at this stage could cause serious Soviet
       misinterpretation of our intentions. I would, therefore, strongly urge that we have <persName corresp="#p_FWC1">Foster</persName> proceed to discuss the present draft with Roschin, even
       though this language will probably not be acceptable to the Soviet Union. If we do have to
       delay further, then I would suggest that we frankly tell the Soviets that we would like to
       see the outcome of the present government crisis in Germany.</p>
                        <p>On Viet-Nam, although <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> did not produce
       anything we could accept, he did go further than the Soviets have ever gone before in
       indicating Soviet willingness to bring pressure on Hanoi if we would cease bombing. Moreover,
       all of the Eastern European Communist governments have been active in trying to bring about a
       cessation of bombing as a prelude to negotiations. If our answer to this is an escalation of
       the bombing, I am afraid the Soviets would conclude that anything other than a hard line on
       their part merely encourages us to think we can safely go for an all-out military victory.
       The tragedy of this, it seems to me, is that such increased bombing would have only a
       marginal effect on military operations in the south and judging from past experience, is
       unlikely to dispose the north to be any more inclined toward a settlement. It could, on the
       other hand, trigger greater Soviet or Chinese involvement and might cause Hanoi to cash the
       blank check it was given at the Bucharest Warsaw Pact meeting.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I should think what gain there has been from the Manila conference<note n="3" xml:id="d184fn3">Regarding the Manila Summit Conference, see ibid., <ref target="#d281">Document 281</ref>.</note> with world opinion would be largely dissipated if it were soon
       followed by an escalation of the bombing in North Viet-Nam.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> left the Soviet Union during the afternoon of

       wish take <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s time with substantive
       discussion this occasion. Said, however, would be glad hear whatever <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> wished say or have conveyed to Washington.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> observed period AMB's
       activities here had been complicated one, as <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet
       relations had deteriorated and were even now rather acute. Asserted reason for such
       deterioration was not prejudice on part <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> towards
       American people or govt but rather Vietnam war. How <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would
       finish that war difficult to say, and even <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> probably did not
       know how it would do it. However, war should be finished and AMB should convey to Washington
       that the sooner that done the better. Reiterating that difficult to say how war could be
       terminated, and noting he making no proposals, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
       suggested <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> making mistake and using wrong tactics. In fact,
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had no tactics; its course of action seemed to be
       accidental and statements made by various <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> leaders were
       contradicting one another. Therefore, other side could have no confidence in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy. Moreover, <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> statements
       contradicted by <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> deeds. Statement made today was
       contradicted by further escalation tomorrow. If President said something, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said next day <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would
       increase its troops in Vietnam up to one million, would destroy Vietnam, etc. While one could
       of course talk about destruction <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0463"/>of Vietnam, to do
       so would not be simple matter, for both sides would suffer in process. If one hundred
       thousand Vietnamese were to be killed, <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would have to
       sacrifice one hundred thousand of its own boys. And this, of course, was in context of
       regular operations rather than of “big things,” of which he was not
       speaking. Thus, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> continued, he regarded <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Vietnam policy as extremely inconsistent and not offering other
       people possibility focus on problem. Said he could describe <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
       policy in certain way but then hesitated and said he would rather not, as description he had
       in mind might be offensive to Ambassador. In any event, he said, <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy not a considered one and <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> did not seem
       know where it going. When <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> said it fighting for Saigon govt
       no one believed that as such govt did not really exist. Nor did anyone believe <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> statements that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> fighting for
       Vietnamese people. To say that Vietnamese people should be protected and to destroy those
       people at the same time was paradox, indeed nonsense.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> then said he wished point out <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> actions Vietnam helping Chinese fan hatred in Asia which in its
       extent and racial aspects similar to that promoted in Germany under Nazis. <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> rendering tremendous assistance to Chinese in this respect, and
       difficult to see how anyone could do more to help Chinese fan hatred of white man. <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> creating situation which intolerable and which could provoke
       great forces into taking dangerous steps. Thus far Chinese leaders making great deal of noise
       but taking no action. However, both Ambassador and he knew how policy was made and what this
       noise signified. This noise could turn into action, for situation where mob frenzy and
       ferocious hatred whipped up could easily get out of control. Neither <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> nor <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> needed such situation. Thus while
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had
       contradictions in that area they had common things as well. What they needed was a settlement
       in Vietnam, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said he could develop his thought
       further, but this very complex problem and only thing he would say now was that US should
       think about it.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> then said another major problem in world
       was European question. Related to European security was non-proliferation, on which agreement
       should be concluded as soon as possible. <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had given us
       its views on subject in New York on Saturday. When Ambassador spoke to President, he should
       tell him not to treat non-proliferation as routine matter, for if that problem were to go
       through bureaucracy much precious time would be lost and history would not forgive that.
       Ambassador should tell President to act as swiftly as possible on Soviet proposal, which
       should not raise any problems of principle. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
       said he believed agreement on non-proliferation should not be treated as technical matter but
       as major historic act. We should handle agreement on non-proliferation in such way as to give
       it greatest importance and official weight, so that it would resound throughout <pb n="436" xml:id="pg_436" facs="0464"/>world. (Apparent implication these remarks is Soviets may wish
       have non-proliferation agreement signed with great fanfare, possibly at highest level.)
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> then said that in his opinion
       non-proliferation “act” must be applicable to both signatories and
       nonsignatories of agreement, and some formula should be found to cover this point. In his
       view, major deficiency of Limited Test Ban was that it did not apply to nonsignatories. At
       this point <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> paused and said he speaking frankly
       in hope that, contrary frequent US practice, his statements would not appear in press
       tomorrow. If they were to appear he would not say anything further to Amb. Ambassador assured
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> his remarks would be held in strictest
       confidence. Kosygin continued it completely improper situation where those who had signed
       agreement did not test whereas nonsignatories engaged in testing. Therefore, such
       non-proliferation formula should be found as would cover not only signatories but others as
       well. Neither <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> nor Soviet formula did so at the moment, but
       any further formula should.</p>
                        <p>6. AMB <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> observed we had given Soviets our
       formula last week, noting he had also given text to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on Saturday. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said he had
       heard about it but had not read it. Ambassador recalled he had participated in Camp David
       discussions with President and Secretary on non-proliferation question, during which
       President expressed strong desire for mutually acceptable formula. President was very
       gratified at progress made in <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> discussions and wanted formula to be found which would
       reflect those discussions. We hoped formula we had given Soviets last week could be basis for
       agreement. Ambassador said non-proliferation was question on which he personally, as well as
       entire <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Govt, convinced <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
       and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had common interest, and we should make every
       effort find expression that interest.</p>
                        <p>7. As to Vietnam, Ambassador said did not wish argue with Chairman but did want make few
       comments. <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> were in
       obvious disagreement as to basic facts this situation. However, it clear that answer to this
       problem is peaceful settlement.</p>
                        <p>He could not exaggerate sincerity with which President approached search for peaceful
       solution. <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> objective limited, and we not seeking destruction
       North Vietnam or South Vietnam. We did not believe Vietnamese would wish Chinese enter into
       this situation. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> interjected that actions were
       sometimes taken without other party being asked; e.g., <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
       bombed North Vietnam while he was there and it neither asked North Vietnam nor informed
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> about its actions. Ambassador reminded <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> about what had preceded our decision to begin bombings.
       He continued by expressing hope Soviets would at some point help find peaceful solution. We
       realized Soviet difficulties in this respect but perhaps Chinese isolation had changed
       situation. Ambassador then recalled that during <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> visit last year, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
                            <pb n="437" xml:id="pg_437" facs="0465"/>had said Vietnamese comrades did not exclude
       peaceful settlement, that this important, and that settlement would naturally be on basis
       17th parallel. Ambassador inquired whether <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
       still held such view.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> responded Vietnamese comrades did not
       exclude peaceful settlement, and he could confirm that such settlement would be on basis
       Geneva Agreements. Vietnamese comrades had been saying this at all meetings which had been
       held thus far. <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> must give a great deal of thought to
       problem. As to Vietnamese, they had set forth their views.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> continued Soviets wanted relaxation
       tensions in both East and West, and peace throughout world. <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would develop its policies and activities in that direction. Ambassador should
       convey this to President and also tell him <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> did not seek
       arms race or tensions. While Soviet decisions would be firm, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would not depart from this course. He should also tell President that <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> firmly adhered to policy of peaceful coexistence and would
       not deviate from that policy. Both party and govt very firm on this point.</p>
                        <p>10. Ambassador concluded conversation by expressing satisfaction <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s remarks. He observed that during his
       tenure of over four years there had been ups and downs in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations but that he was very happy that even now, when we had Vietnam
       problem between us, reasonable level of relations being maintained. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> interjected he also appreciated this. Ambassador said
       he also gratified that, whatever <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet tensions, he
       personally had been treated with friendliness and courtesy by everyone in <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Now that he going back to Washington, where his
       responsibilities would be much broader, he would make particular effort to assist in finding
       solution to Vietnam problem and help further improve <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet
       relations. Said he glad Thompson would replace him as that would ensure continuity.</p>
                        <p>11. Finally, Ambassador alluded to Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s illness and conveyed Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>'s and his own best wishes for her speedy recovery. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> acknowledged his wife not well, noting she had wanted
       see Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> before latter's departure
       but unable do so on account her illness.<note n="5" xml:id="d185fn5">In a December 6 letter
        to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, the President indicated that <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> had reported to him on this conversation and that he
        had studied <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s remarks carefully
        and appreciated the frankness of his observations. Following brief comments on
        non-proliferation, the President responded at length to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s remarks on Vietnam. For text of that portion of the

                        <p>2367. 1. As Soviet leaders who overthrew <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
       in 1964 begin their third year in power, it may be useful time to restate some of our
       conclusions and observations about character of this regime and its policies and how it fared
       during past year. These conclusions are set out in detail in Embassy's A–765<note n="2" xml:id="d186fn2">Dated November 18, it transmitted the annual political and economic
        assessment. (Ibid.)</note> and this telegram will deal primarily with foreign policy aspects
       of regime policies.</p>
                        <p>2. By and large <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> must regard results of past year with satisfaction.
       They can count gains in foreign policy field which, especially from narrow perspective of the
       Kremlin, must seem quite impressive. In internal field, biggest grain harvest in Russian
       history gave the still flagging economy a solid boost and enabled regime to point
       exaggeratedly to virtues of its new agricultural policy. That they are still in serious
       trouble in getting their economy moving again is clear, but their lucky harvest could be
       counted on to blur effects of the deeper economic dislocations for a little while longer.</p>
                        <p>3. They will be most pleased by developments in foreign field where, with China virtually
       isolated in world Communist movement, they have helped achieve what <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> conspicuously failed to do. This is especially
       satisfying to new leaders who had put their competition with China ahead of all other foreign
       policy problems, but they had other gains as well. They made further tangible progress in
       getting on better terms with their neighboring border countries to south, and they must
       believe they have weakened Western bloc with their improved relations with such countries as
       France, above all, but also with Italy and Canada. Indeed, despite a few setbacks as in
       Indonesia and Ghana, their relations with rest of world were improved generally and it was
       ironic but true that new Soviet leadership, while it continued to support insurrection
       against established order wherever this suited its interests, has been able to convince
       remarkably large body of world opinion that its basic purposes are peaceful.</p>
                        <p>4. To be sure, most of favorable foreign policy developments were not result of vigorous
       Soviet moves. On contrary, Soviet foreign policy since <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s demise has been marked by lack of major initiatives. <pb n="439" xml:id="pg_439" facs="0467"/>Yet it is probably this very quiescence of Soviet
       foreign policy that has significantly contributed to many of these changes. Isolation of
       Chinese Communists is of course result primarily of their own actions, but posture of
       restraint Soviets have maintained until very recently in Sino-Soviet dispute has undoubtedly
       contributed to it. In Europe, de Gaulle would have been unable to carry out his grand design
       so expeditiously if an atmosphere of Khrushchevian frolics had continued to prevail. Same
       consideration applies of course to tendency among Western Europeans, and others as well, to
       downgrade Soviet threat.</p>
                        <p>5. Heavy ideological mantle cloaking Soviet foreign policy cannot conceal fact that its
       basic contours are drawn by <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s own national
       interests. Although each Soviet move is always explained in ideological terms, its real aims
       are in most cases transparent. Indeed, in several cases over past year Soviets even
       disregarded need for ideological camouflage of their national interests. In their efforts to
       establish special relationship in Europe with France they almost completely ignored interest
       of French CP in last year's elections. In order to promote their national
       interests in Latin America Soviets drastically curtailed their support for militant
       revolutionary groups, promoted “united front” approach, and engaged in
       fairly active effort to establish relations with several reactionary”
       governments.</p>
                        <p>6. In U.S.-Soviet context, Soviet propaganda speaks of American imperialism but Soviet
       policy is based on tacit assumptions and in some cases even overt cooperation with U.S. Thus
       while it continued to insist that warmer relations were not possible as long as U.S. engaged
       in “aggression” against a brother socialist state, and while its
       vilification of the U.S. in its propaganda extended into all spheres of U.S. foreign and
       domestic policies, not sparing even the President, Moscow still found it possible to
       cooperate with U.S. in some areas where two national interests converged. This reflected in
       signing of air agreement,<note n="3" xml:id="d186fn3">For text of the Civil Air Transport
        Agreement, signed at Washington, November 4, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy:
         Current Documents, 1966,</hi> pp. 493–505.</note> intensified search for mutually
       acceptable formula on non-proliferation, and negotiation of outer space treaty.<note n="4" xml:id="d186fn4">For text of the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in
        the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, finally signed on January 27, 1967, see ibid., 1967,
        pp. 1072–1075.</note> Latest offers by the President for closer U.S.-Soviet ties are also
       undoubtedly tempting to Soviets and, despite their public refusal to accept outstretched U.S.
       hand in present circumstances, possibility cannot be excluded that they will yet engage in
       some specific measures just as they have on air agreement.</p>
                        <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440" facs="0468"/>
                        <p>7. The freeze, in other words, has been a controlled one, with Soviets undoubtedly
       calculating that it will not jeopardize a relatively easy return to more normal relations
       once tactical exigencies for a freeze no longer exist. Basic to this view is
       Kremlin's knowledge at bottom that it could not live with an actively hostile
       United States. It also knows that its security problems cannot be definitively resolved
       without us. Eventually Moscow will need U.S. cooperation in handling awakening Chinese giant.
       In Europe it knows that however useful de Gaulle may be tactically, no final European
       settlement could be achieved without U.S. participation and sanction.</p>
                        <p>8. In Western Europe, Soviets are attempting, in essence, what U.S. is seeking to
       accomplish in EE, i.e., build bridges to individual countries and promote trend toward
       polycentrism. Despite certain success, Soviets are probably conscious of their inability to
       compete effectively in this game. They know they do not have much to offer to West
       Europeans-certainly not on major issue of German settlement-and are also concerned about
       unsettling effect their policy in Western Europe can have on their own alliance. This concern
       was evident last year in Soviet attempts to strengthen Warsaw Pact organization, presumably
       by instituting permanent coordinating body, and must have been compounded by failure of those
       attempts. Concept of unity in diversity being alien to Soviet system, Soviets must realize
       that effect of any overall decrease in cohesion is bound to have much more deleterious effect
       on Warsaw Pact than on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and it is probably because of
       this imbalance of risk that Soviets, despite a little bridge-building, are basically happy
       with status quo and still moving rather cautiously on European scene.</p>
                        <p>9. Regime itself remained nearly static during the year. <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> emerged more clearly than before as first among equals, a primacy he
       conveyed most vividly when he usurped <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s and <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName>'s offices to take his seat as de Gaulle's opposite
       number during General's visit here. As <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> moved ahead, <persName corresp="#p_SAN1">Shelepin</persName>, a prime
       contender for power, moved back, and it may have been that latter's loss was
       simply by-product of former's gain. These minor shadings did not change, however,
       an overall picture of surprising stability of leadership in a society in which struggle for
       power is endemic.</p>
                        <p>10. The personality of the regime also became more sharply drawn, especially at its
       do-nothing 23rd Party Congress in April. Proud of contrast it offers to free-wheeling of
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, present leadership is colorless,
       cautious, conservative and more realistic than its predecessor. It was clearer, too, that its
       instincts for caution led it in almost all cases to take the course of compromise, the
       approach of the lowest common denominator. From standpoint of U.S. security interest, these
       are qualities which make this regime more comfortable one to live with <pb n="441" xml:id="pg_441" facs="0469"/>than was <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s-it is clearly a regime less likely to confront us with
       sudden crises in Cuba or Berlin and it acts circumspectly to avoid direct confrontation with
       us in Vietnam. From standpoint of interests of Soviet people, its virtues are less clear. The
       excessive caution with which it has moved to carry out the seemingly bold economic measures
       of a year and two years ago and to solve its other growing problems in internal field raises
       the question whether this is the regime that will carry through the jarring changes necessary
       to enable Soviet system to compete efficiently in a world of advanced economic and
       technological societies.</p>

                        <p>On December 1, 1966, the intelligence community issued National Intelligence Estimate
       11–12–66, “The Outlook for Sino-Soviet Relations.” The estimate
       concluded that “Sino-Soviet relations will continue to deteriorate so long as the
       Mao Tse-tung-Lin Piao leadership group retains authority.” In the longer term,
       “prospects for major changes leading either to a further deterioration or an
       easing of the dispute appear to rest mainly on what happens in China after Mao.”
       Should there be a Sino-Soviet rapprochement in either the short or longer term, it was
       “likely to have definite limits. We expect little or no positive cooperation at
       the party level and a continuing general atmosphere of barely suppressed suspicion and
       mistrust. Moreover, the Sino-Soviet relationship would remain highly vulnerable to clashes of
       national interests over a broad range of issues.” For text of the estimate, see

                        </p>
                        <p>1. Despite continuing appearance anti-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> remarks in Soviet
       papers, one cannot escape over-all impression that anti-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
       propaganda of most vicious and spurious kind has dropped off perceptibly in main Soviet press
       since mid-Nov, in comparison with Sept and Oct. This has been directly related to a still
       sharper reduction in commentary, photo reporting, and even news coverage of Vietnam war,
       considering that latter recently has been generating good portion of anti-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> material. Propaganda exploitation of uglier events in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> life, notably racial strife, plus usual fare of biased reporting
       on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> institutions and morals, have also tapered off slightly
       during same period. Tapering off of anti-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> propaganda in
       Soviet domestic radio, TV, and provincial press has been slower. Apparently no real let-up
       yet discernible on Moscow international radio (we have <gloss target="#t_FBIS1">FBIS</gloss>
       through Nov 25).</p>
                        <p>2. Hard to imagine this propaganda ebb accidental. While it true period has seen numerous
       speeches by leadership requiring extensive press attention, plus somewhat less dramatic
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> actions than for example President's Asian
        trip,<note n="3" xml:id="d188fn3">On October 17 President Johnson left Washington for a
        17-day tour of the Far East and attended the Manila Conference on Vietnam.</note> Vietnam
       war nevertheless certainly goes on and had been making top news here consistently for many
       months. Particularly striking is failure central Soviet press even to summarize points in
       Vietnam resolution of Hungarian Party Congress (Budapest 640)<note n="4" xml:id="d188fn4">Dated December 3. (National Archives and Records Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 27 VIET <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</note>
       and relatively routine treatment latest <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> bombings Hanoi
       area. Sharp anti-Chinese build-up in same period (<gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>)
       could conceivably provide explanation in sense of propaganda strategy.</p>
                        <p>3. Last vehement anti-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> campaign was mid-Nov discussion
       alleged <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> war crimes in Vietnam. This prompted by early Nov
       release “documents” of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> war crimes
       investigation commission, which initially almost ignored by Soviet press. Coverage of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> also hostile in early part of Nov, but no comparison with Oct,
       which saw vicious charge re <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> chemical warfare in Vietnam in
       connection with Nuremberg <pb n="443" xml:id="pg_443" facs="0471"/>trial anniversary (uglier
       than on 1965 anniversary), attacks on Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, Peace Corps, President's speeches in Asia, exchange program
       (article on Prof Shulman), Westmoreland, and near end Oct, six days of highly offensive
       propaganda on <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> assassination and Warren Report,
       echo of which in provincial press continued through Nov. Sept level was almost as high as
       that of Oct, when one considers cumulative picture of attacks that month re <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> genocide, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> misdeeds, Puerto Rico exploitation, espionage in universities
       and exchanges, defector Harold Koch, convicted <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> soldier

                        <p>Ambassador Dean asked the Deputy Under Secretary what he thought were the prospects for
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations.</p>
                        <pb n="444" xml:id="pg_444" facs="0472"/>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> replied the Soviets were
       conducting a holding operation at present. They were trying to keep everything from going
       down the drain pending a resolution of the Viet Nam conflict. As a result of Viet Nam they
       did not wish to offer or receive any new bilateral initiatives. They were prepared to make
       exceptions when any such initiative was considered by them to be overwhelmingly in their
       self-interest. The bilateral civil air agreement and the outer space agreement were examples.
       In the case of the latter, the Soviets knew they could not afford an arms race in space with
       the U.S. and the agreement had a convenient <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> cover.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet attitude on nonproliferation, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> continued, was changing. This was because it was becoming apparent, due
       to the attitude of the Swedes and the Indians, that unless something was done quickly, we
       would never get an agreement. There might be some progress in the nonproliferation field but
       beyond that nothing until after Viet Nam.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Dean inquired as to the Soviet attitude on <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>'s.<note n="2" xml:id="d189fn2">For documentation on Soviet and U.S.

        <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said the Soviets had a strong defensive

       from the point of view of how much they could afford. We did not think they were very far
       technically advanced in this area. The civilian leadership of the country probably regarded
       ABM's as still being in the experimental stage. There had been no decision to go
       all out. Of course the military, which wanted <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>'s, was in a relatively strong position vis-á-vis the
       present collective civilian leadership.</p>

                        <p>2989. 1. I am increasingly disturbed at number of cases brought to our attention of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> citizens violating Soviet law, and believe we should be taking
       more drastic steps to stop it. As an Embassy we seem over recent weeks to have spent
       inordinate amount of our time picking up pieces after both tourists and exchangees who have
       either broken Soviet laws or allowed themselves to fall into KGB entrapment, and I am sure
       that cases coming to our attention are only small fraction of the total.</p>
                        <p>2. It is particularly discouraging to find that conviction of Wortham and Gilmour for black
       market ruble transactions<note n="2" xml:id="d190fn2">Soviet customs officials arrested Buel
        R. Wortham and Craddock M. Gilmour, Jr., at the Soviet-Finnish border on October 1, 1966. A
        Leningrad court sentenced Wortham on December 21, 1966, to 3 years in a labor camp on
        charges of theft of a statue and violation of Soviet currency regulations. It fined Gilmour
        1,000 rubles for a lesser role in the currency violation. (<hi rend="italic">American
         Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1966,</hi> p. 510n) Also see <ref target="#d207fn4">footnote 4, Document 207</ref>.</note> has had so little effect on conduct of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> visitors and residents here. Judging by number of cases that we
       have learned about just in past week, I suspect <persName corresp="#p_KGM1">Kornienko</persName> was right when he told me last year at time of Dawson release<note n="3" xml:id="d190fn3"> Thomas Dawson, a Peace Corps volunteer in Iran, was apprehended by
        Soviet border guards on September 11, 1966, while gathering seashells near the
        Soviet-Iranian border. He was released on October 3. (<hi rend="italic">American Foreign
         Policy: Current Documents, 1966,</hi> p. 486)</note> that there were hundreds of violations
       of Soviet law by <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> citizens which were never drawn to our
       attention. These include smuggling (which <persName corresp="#p_KGM1">Kornienko</persName>
       singled out as leading example), black market currency exchange, and resale of articles
       bought in foreign currency stores at favorable prices.</p>
                        <p>3. At least a few of these cases have been much more serious than relatively minor
       infractions committed by Wortham and Gilmour and it is ironic, in fact, that Wortham is one
       to get three year sentence when some of our other offenders put his dealings in shade. It
       seems quite likely to me that Soviets would have acted against some of recent offenders if
       they were not reluctant to add another case on top of Wortham-Gilmour or perhaps because they
       wish to avoid giving Amb <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> that kind of problem
       to start his tenure with.</p>

                        <p>4. As far as tourists are concerned, we have already recommended (Moscow 2902)<note n="4" xml:id="d190fn4">Dated January 5. (National Archives and Records Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1967–69, TRV Lanourette, William John)</note>
       that stronger language be included in Dept's handouts on travel to <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> underlining penalties provided under Soviet law and citing
       recent convictions of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> citizens. Dept may also wish to think
       of means to bring this warning more forcefully to attention of prospective travellers here. A
       public statement may have disadvantage of seeming to discourage tourism to <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and also might be forgotten fairly quickly, but Dept should
       be able to persuade travel agencies specializing in Soviet travel to ensure that tourists
       coming here are given strict oral warning about black market operations in addition to travel
       handouts.</p>
                        <p>5. Least excusable violations, and ones for which Dept and Embassy must accept part of
       blame, are those committed by Americans coming here either as exchangees or to meetings
       sponsored under exchange program. In past week we have had two flagrant transgressions by
       exchangees. That one should involve black market ruble transactions, importation of
       pornographic material, sexual promiscuity, distribution of proscribed material, and
       acceptance of letter from Soviet citizen for delivery through Embassy pouch, suggests at very
       least that Dept's procedures for clearing exchange candidates could stand a little
       improvement. All this suggests, too, that there is need for stricter briefing of exchange
       participants by both Dept and Embassy. We are reporting second case in <gloss target="#t_septel1">septel</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>6. We are in process now of discreetly speaking to each exchangee to make sure no one in
       doubt about his responsibilities here or that Embassy will recommend immediate recall of
       anyone guilty of gross violation of Soviet law. We also plan to tighten our own procedures
       for briefing all exchangees on arrival and for continuing contact with them during their
       stay, and will be making recommendations separately to Dept on steps it should consider
       taking there to same end. My purpose in this message is to call attention to general
       situation and impress upon Dept need that something be done about it.</p>
                        <p>7. While I am satisfied that behavior of Embassy staff is correct and that everyone is
       fully briefed on arrival, I am also planning to reiterate their responsibilities to them as
        well.<note n="5" xml:id="d190fn5">The Department replied in telegram 120403, January 17,

                        <p>During the Secretary's meeting with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> tonight, the discussion turned to bilateral relations. After some
       general discussion in which <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> took a rather
       pessimistic view, the Secretary informed him that the East-West trade legislation probably
       would not be coming up for consideration until May or June. However, the Secretary said he
       felt reasonably optimistic with regard to the Consular Convention which would be considered
       much sooner. After some discussion of <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> Director J.E.
       Hoover's statement,<note n="2" xml:id="d191fn2">See <ref target="#d194">Document
         194</ref> and footnote <ref target="#d191fn4">4</ref> thereto.</note> Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> suggested that the Administration had not really made
       it clear that the Consular Convention did not provide for the opening of consulates. That was
       an entirely separate question which had not even been officially discussed.</p>
                        <p>During this phase of the conversation the Secretary referred to the new Soviet magazine,
        <hi rend="italic">Sputnik</hi>, and the desirability of mutual exchanges. Ambassador
        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> spoke glowingly of the new Soviet magazine,
       but was otherwise noncommittal. There was also some inconclusive discussion on the project
       for the establishment of some form of East-West institute being undertaken by McGeorge Bundy.
       When Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said the project seemed very
       vague to him, the Secretary pointed out that this was intentionally so; that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName>'s efforts were exploratory in nature; and that
       he did not have any specific project to propose, but was rather setting out to ascertain the
       possibilities of cooperation.<note n="3" xml:id="d191fn3">Documentation on the establishment

                        <p>Reverting to the question of the proposed East-West trade legislation, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he had studied this carefully. As he
       understood it, this was a bill for the Eastern European countries and not for the Soviet
       Union. It seemed to him that the proposed bill almost said that the U.S. would not deal with
       the Soviet Union. The Secretary replied that the same provisions would apply to the Soviet
       Union as to the other Eastern European countries. A trade agreement would have to be
       concluded; in the case of the Soviet Union it was true that this would involve a lend-lease
       settlement. He asked <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s views on
       this, and the Ambassador indicated that they would expect any such settlement to be on the
       basis of the most favorable settlement we had made with other World War II allies, referring
       specifically to the United Kingdom.<note n="4" xml:id="d191fn4">For more information on

       anti-missile missile. They're going to spend $30/40 billion and we're
       going to spend $30/40. We don't want to get in that arms race, so I sent Tommy
       Thompson back over there. I tried to talk them out of it. Now we've made a good
       deal of progress in the Civil Air Agreement. We don't trust them. We
       don't think you can trust them. We think you got to watch them every minute. We
       think you ought to watch them more than we are watching them. But the problem is not their
       knowing what we got. Hell, they've got blueprints of everything, as Judy Coplon
        shows.<note n="3" xml:id="d192fn3">On March 7, 1950, Judith Coplon and Valentin Gubitchev, a
        Soviet consular official, were found guilty of conspiracy and attempted espionage against
        the United States.</note> The problem is we don't know what the hell they got,
       and the consulate thing gives us a chance to protect our people and get around and to have
       some little something besides right just in Moscow. And all of our people like <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> and the experts say it's just so important.
       If they want to put x consulars here, well we don't mind how many million he gets,
       and he can just by God sleep with them. We expect them to be sleeping with people over there
       too, but we want to know more than we do know, and we think it's to our interest,
       not to theirs, that we think the advantages are so much stronger for us, at least <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> does and <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>
       does and <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> does, so that is it. And if in talking to

       affirmative and say to <persName corresp="#p_FW1">Fulbright</persName>, “I am not
       running the State Department. I'm not passing on these treaties. I am not against
       a consular office provided-you know what I've said, it takes additional
       personnel.” That's what I think he said to <persName corresp="#p_RJJ1">Rooney</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d192fn4">See <ref target="#d163fn3">footnote 3,
         Document 163</ref>.</note> I think that's all he intended to say. I
       don't think he intended to start passing on diplomatic matters, but I
       don't know and I don't know whether I'm the one to get him
       to do it or whether you are. He wrote a letter that kind of halfway did it but it
       didn't do it enough to satisfy the Dirksens.</p>

       and I talked to <persName corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName> last night. It
       doesn't quite do the job. What we need for him to say is-if I could get him over
       here and get <persName corresp="#p_FW1">Fulbright</persName> over here and just sit down with
       them and say, “Here's what the advantage is to us,” and let

       “Now what do you need to do to see that our security is protected?” And
       he could say, “well I need so and so and so.” “OK,

       his credentials as Ambassador to the Soviet Union. He served until January 14, 1969. His

       14, 1966, to become Deputy Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs. In a January 21

       emphasized that he had asked <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> to return as his
       Ambassador to the Soviet Union “because of the great importance I attach to the
       improvement of relations between our two countries.” The President then proposed
       that the United States and the Soviet Union conduct discussions toward reaching an
       understanding which would “curb the strategic arms race.” <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> replied on February 27 that the Soviet Government was
       “prepared to continue the exchange of views” on strategic nuclear
       weapons, and Johnson announced the Soviet willingness discuss the issue at a March 2 press

                        <p>Dear Karl,</p>
                        <p>I have received your letter of January 21, 1967,<note n="2" xml:id="d194fn2">Not printed.
        (Ibid.)</note> in which you advised that you are concerned and confused over the various
       interpretations being given to my letter of September 16, 1966, to Secretary of State
        <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, “with regard to the position of the
        <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> on the probable consequences likely to result from
       ratification of the Consular Treaty now before the United States Senate.”<note n="3" xml:id="d194fn3">See <ref target="#d192fn2">footnote 2, Document 192</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>It should be clearly understood that the <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> is the
       investigative arm of the Department of Justice and, as such, it is our responsibility to
       gather and report facts. The <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> is not a policy-making
       agency and we do not express opinions. Since 1924, when I became its Director, the <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> has refrained from injecting itself into the area of
       legislation. The Consular Convention between the Soviet Union and the United States, which is
       now before the United States Senate, is no exception to this long-standing rule.</p>
                        <p>Because the Consular Convention does involve considerations which have a direct bearing
       upon the responsibilities of the <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss>, I appreciate your
       interest in requesting the following facts from me. Again I emphasize that the <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> is not recommending a course of action or expressing an
       opinion.</p>
                        <p>You specifically inquired whether I had changed my views or whether any evidence has
       developed to make me change my mind about my testimony of March 4, 1965.<note n="4" xml:id="d194fn4"> Mundt was one of several members of the Senator Foreign Relations
        Committee who, influenced in part by <persName corresp="#p_HJE1">Hoover</persName>'s testimony, had dissented from the committee's
        recommendation in 1965 that the Senate ratify the Consular Convention. Regarding <persName corresp="#p_HJE1">Hoover</persName>'s testimony, see <ref target="#d163fn3">footnote 3, Document 163</ref>.</note> The answer is an unequivocal no.</p>
                        <p>During my testimony before a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee on March 4,
       1965, I called attention to the fact that the establishment of Soviet consulates in this
       country, “of course, will make our work more difficult.” At no point in
       my March, 1965, testimony-nor following the release of that testimony by the House
       Appropriations Committee in May, 1965-did I state or imply that the Consular Convention would
       impose any additional burdens of responsibility <pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452" facs="0480"/>upon
       the <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> that we are incapable of handling. Nor did I express
       any opinion concerning the matter of ratification. The simple fact is that the work of the
        <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> in combating Soviet-directed espionage activities in
       this country has increased through the years commensurate with the increase in Soviet
       representation here. I can also state without equivocation that communist-bloc diplomatic
       establishments in this country serve as focal points for intelligence operations.</p>
                        <p>You inquired whether, since March 4, 1965, there has been a cessation of attempts by
       communist diplomatic personnel in this country to engage in acts of subversion or attempted
       espionage. The answer again is an unequivocal no.</p>
                        <p>You asked whether these efforts by communist diplomatic personnel still continue. They most
       certainly do. Representatives of the KGB (Soviet Committee of State Security) and the GRU
       (Soviet Military Intelligence Service), comprising a large segment of the Soviet diplomatic
       corps in the United States, are conducting an intensive campaign aimed at the most sensitive
       data regarding our scientific and technical developments, our military and defense programs
       and the future plans of our Government.</p>
                        <p>You requested that you be supplied with a list of attempts by communist diplomatic
       personnel to engage in acts of subversion or attempted espionage as they are available for
       public information, segregated by calendar years over the past six to ten years. In
       accordance with your request, there is attached a list of Soviet officials stationed in this
       country who have been arrested or expelled from the United States since January 1, 1957.<note n="5" xml:id="d194fn5">Not printed.</note>

       Soviet action on Industrial Design exhibit.<note n="2" xml:id="d195fn2">The Embassy reported
        in telegram 3164, January 24, that Spirin informed an Embassy officer that the Soviet Union,
        “due to number of circumstances,” would not receive the Industrial
        Design exhibit during the time proposed by the Department, nor would it be accepted earlier
        than December 1967. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> commented:
        “This is clearly top-level decision and I do not believe anything we could do
        would allow us to proceed with exhibit in near future.” (Ibid.) Telegram 124520
        to Moscow, January 24, noted that the Department thought the issue important enough to
        discuss with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. (Ibid.)</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> reviewed negotiating history, stressing Soviet
       commitment to receive exhibit in early 1967, and <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> actions in
       conformance with Soviet stipulations.</p>
                        <p>2. Emphasizing degree of official interest and concern with exchanges program, exemplified
       at time of signing agreement last March, <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> pointed
       out that inevitable publicity of Soviet action likely to have wider effect than upon
       Exchanges Agreement itself. Quoted Romanovsky statements made during negotiations committing
       Soviet Government to receive exhibit in early 1967. Then pointed out that failure Soviets
       live up to exchange commitments could lead many to question validity Soviet commitments in
       other engagements such as proposed Consular Convention. This could seriously affect our
       strong efforts to have Convention approved by Senate.</p>
                        <p>3. In reply to <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName>'s expression of hope
       for Soviet reconsideration, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> expressed his
       understanding of situation and implications of action, and promised to seek quick reply from
       Moscow.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> replied in negative to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> query as to whether commitment to December opening

                        <p>1. I first put strongly to him the case for their going forward with the Kiev exhibition at
       a time when the Consular Convention was delicately balanced and we were trying to push
       forward with other enterprises involving U.S.-Soviet Union relations. He said that he agreed
        <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455" facs="0483"/>with me that Moscow should not risk tipping the
       balance in the wrong direction on this minor issue; and he had so recommended to Moscow.<note n="2" xml:id="d197fn2">In telegram 129728 to Moscow, February 2, the Department reported
        that <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had telephoned <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> to reinforce the démarche made by Rostow on January 27.

        telegram 132463 to Moscow, February 6, the Department reported that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> called <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> on
        February 4 “to advise him that because of President's expressed
        concern Soviet authorities had reacted favorably to our request that Industrial Design
        Exhibit go forward first half of 1967.” The telegram noted that the President
        discussed the problem with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on January 27
        following the signing of the Outer Space Treaty. (National Archives and Records

                        </p>
                        <p>2. He then asked me what my assessment was of the prospects for the Consular Convention. I
       said it was a close thing, as he knew; but the Administration was working hard at it.</p>
                        <p>3. He asked why the Administration was obviously working so hard on the Consular Convention
       this year when it did not work so hard last year. I said that I could not give a responsible
       government answer to that question; but it was my personal view that the shift in the
       seriousness of the Soviet Union on the non-proliferation agreement had made a deep
       impression; and there was a growing sense in the government-with the non-proliferation
       agreement and other matters, including the problem posed by the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>-that this was a good time to do the maximum we could on both sides to create a
       good atmosphere in U.S.-Soviet relations. He said that this was a clear and understandable
       answer to a question which had puzzled him. I said, again, this was a personal judgment.</p>
                        <p>4. We then moved to the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> issue. I explained in some
       detail why it might be possible for the Soviet Union to move slowly and in small increments
       on the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>'s, but that in a democratic society
       with two Senators from each state, it would be extremely difficult to have an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system limited to one city or one region. If we installed such
       a general system, I was sure the Soviet marshals would be pressing the government in Moscow
       for many more offensive missiles to which, inevitably, there would be still another U.S.
       response. Therefore, this was a moment for us to try hard to stabilize the strategic nuclear
       arms race. He said that he understood this argument, but would not commit himself
       further.</p>
                        <p>5. I then pointed out to him that it would be harder to get nations to sign a
       non-proliferation agreement if they saw the United States and the Soviet Union entering
       another major round in the arms race. He questioned me as to whether I was proposing a
       specific link between the non-proliferation agreement and the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> agreement. I said that I was not, but merely underlining the difficulties we
       might both face if we were urging others to enter a world of non-proliferation while each <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0484"/>of us was spending many billions of dollars in
       bilateral strategic arms race. He said that he understood and agreed with this view.</p>
                        <p>6. He asked, in this context, if the Germans were going to propose changes in the language
       of the non-proliferation treaty. I said that I did not know. We had no final response from
       Bonn. He expressed the hope that they would find it possible to accept the present draft.
       Once changes, even minor changes, were suggested, there would be difficulties in re-clearing
       the treaty with all parties.</p>

                        <p>3465. 1. Following are some first impressions after a month back in Moscow. They will of
       course be subject to change after further contact and observation.</p>
                        <p>2. The leadership appears weak. While <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> is
       clearly number one, the Politburo is in fact operating collectively. One well-informed
       observer told me that formerly it was only <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458" facs="0486"/>necessary
       to convince <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in order to carry out a given
       proposal. Now it was necessary to convince nearly every member of the Politburo since almost
       any one of them could successfully block it. It appears true, however, that the direction and
       management of agriculture and the economy has improved and that the regime's pride
       in its “business-like” approach is largely justified although hampered
       by collectivity which makes for indecision and lack of bold initiatives.</p>
                        <p>3. The volume of daily anti-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> items in the press is greater
       than I had realized, not only in connection with Vietnam but in the general distortion of
       American life and policies.</p>
                        <p>4. The standard of living has improved over the past four and a half years but only
       slowly.</p>
                        <p>5. People express themselves more freely in private conversation and the intellectuals are
       straining at the limits set for their activities. These limits have widened since my last
       tour here.</p>
                        <p>6. Ideology appears to play an even more important role in policy making as well as
       propaganda-possibly the result of the CHICOM hammering at revisionism. The fiftieth
       anniversary celebration will doubtless bring increased emphasis on ideology.</p>
                        <p>7. There is a somewhat greater emphasis on internal problems in relation to foreign
       affairs.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was a prolific source of information
       on Soviet policies and the thinking that lay behind them. Now there is remarkably little
       contact between the diplomatic corps and the political leadership and such as there is, is
       not generally rewarding.</p>

                        <p>3563. 1. During my call on <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> today, he raised
       question of discrimination against Soviet vessels in U.S. ports. Noting he had discussed this
       with <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>, he complained that while U.S. vessels
       treated by Soviets on equal basis with ships any other nation, only Soviet vessels
       discriminated against by U.S. He wanted me to report to U.S. Govt Soviets regarded their
       request for equality as legitimate and would wish U.S. reply on this matter. He said he
       wanted bring up this subject in this fashion rather than formally.</p>
                        <p>2. I told him that U.S. Govt already working on this problem. However, he probably knew
       that difficulties were due to position taken by American trade unions rather than govt. While
       noting this not directly related to subject he had brought up, I mentioned that our goodwill
       could be seen from fact only last month we had assisted more than <pb n="460" xml:id="pg_460" facs="0488"/>40 Soviet vessels in evacuating members of crew who had fallen ill, providing
       for repairs, etc.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said Soviets very grateful for U.S.
       assistance and noted Soviet ships also have strict instructions assist U.S. vessels as well
       as vessels of any other nation, in case of distress. As to my remark re trade unions, he
       commented Soviets also had trade unions and that latter complained about U.S. discrimination
       and demanded equality. <persName corresp="#p_KGM1">Kornienko</persName> added that problem
       with U.S. was not only of trade unions' position but also of discriminatory rules
       such as prior notice, etc.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> concluded discussion on this subject by
       stating that if we wanted improve U.S.-Soviet relations, something Soviets desired sincerely
       rather than as matter of expediency, there should be no discrimination by either side. <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could reciprocate in full but that would serve no useful
       purpose. All <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> wants is equal treatment and U.S. should
       therefore consider Soviet request.</p>

                        <p>1. After raising question of equal treatment for Soviet vessels in U.S. ports (<gloss target="#t_septel1">septel</gloss>),<note n="2" xml:id="d203fn2">

                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that as to general question of
       U.S.-Soviet relations both sides must seriously seek relaxation of tensions. <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> does not want arms competition, it wants relaxation of
       tensions. Noting he wanted me to report his remarks to President, he also said all Soviets
       did in France and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> was not for purpose of putting those
       countries up against U.S. In fact, in discussing question of treaty with <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>,<note n="3" xml:id="d203fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> proposed an Anglo-Soviet friendship treaty
        during his early February visit to London.</note> he had expressed full understanding for
        <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> commitments visá-vis U.S. Soviets believe
       relations could be improved without affecting alliance commitments, and were proceeding on
       same basis within their own alliance.</p>
                        <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461" facs="0489"/>
                        <p>2. I responded by noting that President had asked me to return to Moscow because he hoped
       to have problems between U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> resolved. I did not
       wish to be immodest and I did not know how much I could contribute to this objective, but I
       had come here in hope that I could make some contribution. Since Ambassadors now tied to
       telegraph lines, perhaps their role not as important as it used to be, but I would seek
       promote President's objective to best of my abilities.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> concluded our meeting by saying this was
       exactly how Soviets had understood my appointment. Soviets had regarded it as a serious step
       by President reflecting his desire for improved U.S.-Soviet relations. As to my remark on the
       role of ambassador in modern world he had to disagree because in addition to his chair and
       his telegram wire, Ambassador had a head; if head was good people at the other end of wire
       listened to it.</p>

                        <p>The conversation after dinner opened with a discussion of the problems presented by the
       arrest of a Soviet trawler within the three-mile limit off Alaska.<note n="2" xml:id="d204fn2">On March 2 a U.S. Coast Guard cutter arrested and seized a Soviet fishing
        vessel after it had been fishing within the 3-mile limit off the Shumagin Islands, Alaska.
        On being hailed the vessel made for high seas, throwing overboard its catch as it went.
        (Memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_MLC1">Meeker</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, March 3; ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> recalled that on several
       occasions he had been asked by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> to
       withdraw the entire Soviet fishing fleet from waters off our West Coast for considerable
       periods <pb n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0490"/>of time. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> had appealed to his understanding of American politics
       to propose friendly and cooperative actions on the part of the Soviet Union. These
       withdrawals of the Soviet fleet were in no way required by international law, but were done
       simply to be of assistance to the United States Government. On one of these occasions, he
       said, he was startled after a perfectly calm meeting with the then Governor of Alaska to read
       a newspaper story to the effect that the Governor of Alaska had pounded the table, and in
       effect given the Soviet Union an ultimatum which they had then accepted. He had shrugged this
       off as part of the game of American politics.</p>
                        <p>But, he said, he could see that after this trawler episode, he might well be met the next
       time he was asked to take some such step by a telegram ordering him to tell the American
       Government “to go to hell”.</p>
                        <p>He thought this arrest was a first offense, and hinted it might be treated as such. I
       remarked that according to our information, the trawler was well within the three-mile limit,
       and had been fishing.</p>
                        <p>In the Ambassador's presence, I called Attorney General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Clark</persName> to obtain the latest information on the case. I explained
       the situation to the Attorney General, who reported on the steps taken and under way. He
       commented on the political implications of the episode in Alaska and on the West Coast. I
       called his attention not only to the bearing of the episode on our Soviet relations, but that
       we had been opposing high fines for American fishing boats off Peru and Ecuador.</p>
                        <p>I said we should be in touch with him in the morning. And I told the Ambassador simply that
       we were following the case closely, and would of course provide them with every facility they
       wished to dispose of the matter quickly.</p>

                        <p>For Ambassador from Secretary.</p>
                        <p>1. Svetlana Iosifovna Stalin, daughter of Josef Stalin, walked into U.S. Embassy New Delhi
       6 March with passport and luggage and requested political asylum. Signed request for asylum
       in U.S.</p>
                        <pb n="463" xml:id="pg_463" facs="0491"/>
                        <p>2. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCA1">Bowles</persName> authorized issuance U.S. visa
       for sole purpose to permit Svetlana leave New Delhi and she departed shortly after midnight 6
       March via Quantas flight to Rome. Embassy officer traveling on diplomatic passport
       accompanied her. She possesses open ticket from Rome to U.S. but has no reservations beyond
       Rome.</p>
                        <p>3. Svetlana reported she arrived India 20 December 1966 accompanying ashes her deceased
       common law husband, Brajesh Singh, expatriate Indian who lived Moscow and worked for foreign
       languages publishing house. She said Brajesh Singh is uncle of Dinesh Singh with whom she
       spent last week prior arriving at U.S. Embassy New Delhi. Dinesh Singh is Secretary of State
       in Indian Foreign Office.</p>
                        <p>4. Svetlana claims she came to India on one month visa but has made repeated attempts
       remain there, including appeals to Dinesh Singh and Mrs. Gandhi, all to no avail. 6 March she
       asked Soviet Ambassador Benediktov for permission remain but he flatly refused, insisted she
       return Moscow via Aeroflot on 8 March and told her she would not be allowed leave <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> again. She then came U.S. Embassy.</p>
                        <p>5. Ambassador Reinhardt has been advised that we feel it would be undesirable for Svetlana
       to proceed to U.S., both politically and from point of view her security. We consider it
       urgent that every effort be made arrange other safer asylum in Switzerland, Spain or Italy
       and have asked Ambassador Reinhardt to make every effort to have her persuaded that such
       course in her best interest. When she agrees, we will approach the govt concerned prior to
       her formal application for permission to enter. Arrangements are being made with the Italians
       for her to remain there safely for period sufficient to enable us to work out the
        problem.<note n="2" xml:id="d205fn2">

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> called on request. I told him
       that we wished to be completely frank and honest with him with respect to our involvement in
       the case of Madame Svetlana Alliluyeva.</p>
                        <p>In this connection I wanted him to know precisely what had happened in New Delhi and to
       realize that our intervention was purely humanitarian in accord with the long established
       American tradition. Since it contained the most complete account of these events and since it
       should be assumed that the document would likely become available to the Soviets, in one way
       or another, in Delhi, I read to him Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCA1">Bowles</persName>' letter of March 10, 1967 to Mr. C.S. Jha, Foreign Secretary of
       the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He took copious notes and has almost a complete
       version of that letter (copy attached).<note n="2" xml:id="d206fn2">Not printed.</note> After
       he had fully noted this account of events in Delhi, I told him that it was my understanding
       that she had applied to the Swiss Government for a visa allowing her to visit there for rest
       and recuperation and that the Swiss Government had acceded to her request. I understood that
       she was already in Switzerland and assumed that there would be news confirming this out of
       Switzerland tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>I went on to say that the United States has no desire whatsoever to exploit the case. As he
       would have been able to judge for himself, we had shown restraint by refusing any comment
       whatsoever up to the present time, and we would continue to show restraint. We would comment
       publicly only if we were obliged to do so because of what others might say, specifically
       either the Soviets themselves or the Indians. I continued that the United States Government
       hopes that this case will not do damage to Soviet-American bilateral relations at this
       delicate juncture; that our actions have been and continue to be guided <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465" facs="0493"/>by that consideration. This was the reason why I was being so
       full and explicit and frank in letting him know precisely the extent of our involvement.</p>
                        <p>I said that we had no desire to have Svetlana come to the United States and that she seemed
       to have agreed that this would not be in her own best interest or in the best interest of
       either the United States or the Soviet Union or of the relations between the two.</p>
                        <p>I said that Svetlana's future depended exclusively on her. She had never been in
       our custody nor had her movements been determined by us. I understood that at the present
       time she did not wish to return to the USSR but that it was really her decision where she
       would go after her visit to Switzerland.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> expressed what seemed to be real
       and heartfelt appreciation for this communication. He said that he had noted the press
       stories and had heard many rumors and had feared that troubles might ensue. He said he was
       accordingly very thankful to have this full explanation. He added with apparent relief that
       it would now be up to his colleague in Switzerland to pursue the case by trying to have a
       talk with Svetlana.</p>

        ratification on March 16, and the President ratified the convention on March 31.</note> I
       said I was sure he had noted this and he indicated assent. I pointed out that the debates
       were still continuing in the Senate and that it was very important that nothing happen which
       would turn the tide against ratification.</p>
                        <p>In this connection I said we were concerned about the handling of the Wortham case which we
       understood was to be considered tomorrow by the Court of Appeals.<note n="3" xml:id="d207fn3">On December 21, 1966, a Leningrad court had sentence Buel R. Wortham to 3 years in a labor
        camp on charges of theft of a statue and violation of Soviet currency regulations.</note>
       Obviously, the most favorable thing that could happen would be that the Court of Appeals
       should release Wortham. I thought this would ensure passage of the Consular Treaty. However,
       as a very minimum, it was important that no action be taken which would cause a negative
       reaction. He asked whether postponement would be a good thing. I replied that release of
       Wortham would be the best thing, but that I would repeat as a minimum nothing adverse should
       be done tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he understood my point and
       that he would promptly telegraph Moscow on this matter.<note n="4" xml:id="d207fn4">On March
        11 the Soviet Court of Appeals reversed Wortham's labor camp sentence and fine
        him 5,000 rubles. In a March 11 memorandum <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>
        called it an “unprecedented reversal,” which he also tied to his

                        <p>Dear Walt:</p>
                        <p>I am enclosing some documents in regard to the Svetlana episode which I think will interest
       you; you may want to show them to the President. I have sent a similar set to the
       Secretary.</p>
                        <p>These enclosures are (1) a play by play description of the series of events that took place
       here in Delhi; (2) a copy of Svetlana's handwritten statement in which she
       described her family relationships and why she has determined not to return to the Soviet
       Union; and (3) a copy of a personal note of appreciation which she sent me from
        Switzerland.<note n="2" xml:id="d208fn2">The first enclosure is printed below; the other two
        were not attached.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>As you will sense from her Statement she is an extraordinary person.</p>
                        <p>Our operation here was a ticklish one and everyone concerned performed with competence. If
       we had refused to help her she would have gone to the press and the roof would have blown off
       at home. If we had gone directly to the Indians for “guidance” she
       would have pressured us formally for asylum and there would have been a major conflict among
       the Indians, Soviets and ourselves.</p>
                        <p>She is going to write a book (indeed it is already largely written) which will sell
       hundreds of thousands of copies.<note n="3" xml:id="d208fn3">Reference is to <hi rend="italic">Twenty Letters to a Friend</hi>, published by Harper &amp; Row in

       hurt, <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations. If, after dealing with the Stalin
       years, her emphasis were on the new more liberal Soviet generation and hopes that it can
       develop a cooperative relationship with America the favorable impact could be very great.</p>

                        <p>New Delhi, March 15, 1967.</p>
                        <p>SUBJECT</p>
                        <p>Defection of Svetlana Alliloueva </p>
                        <p>1. At 7:30 pm on March 6, 1967, a neatly dressed woman carrying a small suitcase appeared
       at the main door of the Chancery. Speaking good but accented English she told the Marine
       Guard Cpl. Daniel Wall that she was a Russian citizen and she wished to talk to an Embassy
       officer.</p>
                        <p>2. According to standard procedure Cpl. Wall called the Consular Officer George Huey,
       Security Officer John St. Denis, and appropriate [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
        source text not declassified</hi>] officers and asked the woman to wait in the Marine Guard
       Office near the entrance until the officers arrived.</p>
                        <p>3. The Consular Officer, Mr. Huey, arrived at the Chancery at 7:35 pm shortly followed by
       the Security Officer, John St. Denis and the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
        text not declassified</hi>] officers.</p>
                        <p>4. According to the woman's passport she was Svetlana Iosifovna Alliloueva, born
       in Moscow, February 22, 1926 and entered India December 20, 1966. She was taken to the <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>'s empty office where she was interviewed by Mr. Huey
       and by [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>5. The following are the pertinent points of the interview: (In addition, the text of a
       statement which she wrote out in longhand later in the evening is attached.)</p>
                        <p>A. Svetlana stated that she was the daughter of Joseph Stalin by his second wife, Nadezhda
       Alliloueva, and that she was the “common law wife” of Brajesh Singh, an
       uncle of Dinesh Singh, who had been an employee of the Foreign Languages Publishing House in
       Moscow.</p>
                        <p>B. Svetlana stated she had arrived in India on December 20, 1966, accompanying the ashes of
       Brajesh Singh, who had died in Moscow in late October 1966. She and Brajesh had wanted to
       marry, but had been denied permission. This denial was conveyed to her by <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> personally. It was also <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> who personally approved her visit to India, <pb n="469" xml:id="pg_469" facs="0497"/>evidently after strong representations from Dinesh Singh and T.N. Kaul.</p>
                        <p>C. The ceremony for immersion of Brajesh's ashes in the Ganges took place on
       December 25, 1966, near Brajesh's village in Uttar Pradesh. Dinesh Singh had
       wanted to use this occasion to demonstrate Indo-Soviet amity, and had invited the top Soviet
       Embassy officials, (neglecting to inform and invite many of Brajesh's old
       friends). The Soviet Embassy, however, was under orders to keep everything quiet, so none of
       them attended.</p>
                        <p>D. She had long been disillusioned with Communism. It was not just the disappointments
       related to governmental interference in her personal life in the past few years (i.e. refusal
       to allow her to marry Brajesh), nor was it a result of the 20th Party Congress. Her
       disillusionment she said had begun long before, but recent events had provided her with both
       the additional incentive to make this critical decision and the opportunity to carry it out,
       which would probably never be repeated.</p>
                        <p>E. Her initial permission had been for a two week stay in India and she had simply defied
       the Soviet Government by remaining in the village for two months, ignoring requests, then
       orders, from the Soviet Embassy that she return immediately.</p>
                        <p>F. Svetlana stated that she had fallen in love with India and her first desire was to
       remain here. She considered her late husband's family in U.P. her own; they felt
       the same way about her and wanted her to stay with them. She had discussed the matter with
       T.N. Kaul, who was strongly opposed to her remaining. In fact Kaul exchanged several letters
       with her while she was in U.P., urging her to return to Moscow. She also spoke with Dinesh
       Singh, who said that she could remain in India only if the Soviet Government gave her
       permission; “this was not the time when India could afford a disturbance in its
       relations with the Soviet Union.” She requested Dinesh Singh to take the matter up
       with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. He later told her that he had done so, and that she had
       agreed with him that it was impossible. With this hope gone she felt that her only hope of
       remaining in India rested with the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>G. Consequently on March 6 she had lunch with Soviet Ambassador and Mrs. Benediktov and
       again requested that she be permitted to remain in India. But once again her request was
       bluntly refused. The tenor of the meeting left no doubt in her mind that she would never
       again be permitted out of the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>H. At one point either Dinesh Singh or T.N. Kaul (it is not clear which) suggested to her
       that, if she were determined not to return to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, she
       might consider an approach to a “third country,” as India could not
       accept her.</p>
                        <pb n="470" xml:id="pg_470" facs="0498"/>
                        <p>I. Svetlana said that when Ambassador Benediktov made it clear that she would have to be on
       the flight to Moscow leaving Delhi early Wednesday morning<note n="5" xml:id="d208fn5">March
        8.</note> and in view of the refusal of Dinesh Singh and T.N. Kaul to help her she resolved
       to appeal to the United States for help. On the evening of March 6 she packed one suitcase
       (leaving two others behind) in her room on the Soviet Embassy compound, called a taxi to the
       gate of the compound, and asked the driver to take her to the American Embassy. He did so
       without hesitation.</p>
                        <p>J. In response to persistent questioning Svetlana insisted that she definitely could not go
       back to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, as she was determined to live her life as
       a free person. In the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> she was not only subject to the
       restrictions that apply to all citizens, but to additional ones that applied to her because
       of her unfortunate position as some sort of “national relic.” If she
       returned to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> Svetlana was not sure that her defiance
       of orders during her stay in India would be punished, but she was certain she would never
       have another opportunity to travel abroad.</p>
                        <p>K. Since she could not remain in India, she was appealing to the United States, which was a
       country she greatly admired. She wrote and signed a formal request for asylum in the United
       States in which she stated she is <gloss target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss> member but no longer
       favors the Communist system. No promises of any kind were made to her.</p>
                        <p>L. Svetlana was also told that we could not at this point definitely promise asylum to her,
       and asked her what other courses were open to her. She replied that if the United States
       could not or would not help her she did not believe that any other country represented in
       India would be willing to do so. Since she was determined not to return, her only alternative
       was immediately to tell her story fully and frankly to the press in the hope that she could
       rally public support in India and the United States.</p>
                        <p>M. Svetlana was reminded that at this time the Soviet Embassy, being occupied with a full
       formal reception in honor of Marshal Zakharov, was still probably unaware of her departure,
       and if she chose to return she could still do so without them being aware that she had ever
       left. She clearly and forcefully stated once again that she could not and would not go
       back.</p>
                        <p>6. During the evening [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
        declassified</hi>] Roger Kirk, the Embassy Soviet Affairs Specialist, and Richard F.
       Celeste, the Ambassador's Personal Assistant, were also called in. The interview
       was interrupted at approximately 9:00 pm to permit the preparation of a Flash cable<note n="6" xml:id="d208fn6">Not found.</note> to Washington.</p>
                        <pb n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0499"/>
                        <p>7. The initial part of this cable summarized the facts outlined above and indicated that in
       our estimate we could count on no more than four hours before the Soviet Embassy discovered
       that Svetlana was missing. The message also pointed out that once her defection was
       discovered and the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> informed we would almost certainly be
       prohibited from assisting her. The message concluded that “unless advised to
       contrary we will try to get Svetlana on Quantas Flight 751 to Rome leaving Delhi at
       1945Zulu” (1:15 am March 7 local time) and stated that she will be accompanied by
       Embassy officer [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
       declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>8. This cable to Washington was transmitted at 9:40 pm (March 6, 1610Z) and its receipt was
       acknowledged by Washington eleven minutes later.</p>
                        <p>9. At this point it was explained to Svetlana that we could not guarantee her asylum in the
       United States, but we were willing to assist her in leaving India for Rome immediately if she
       should choose to do so. She was cautioned that this would mean burning her bridges behind her
       with no clear idea of what lay ahead. She asked whether we would abandon her in Rome if it
       should be decided not to let her go to the United States. She was told that if we could not
       grant her asylum we would certainly continue to assist her until she did find a haven.
       Svetlana then stated that she chose to proceed to Rome.</p>
                        <p>10. At this point, since a number of arrangements had to be made, Svetlana was asked
       whether she would be willing to write out a brief life history. She agreed to do so and spent
       the rest of the evening until her departure for the airport writing. The text of this
       longhand statement has been transmitted separately.</p>
                        <p>11. From Svetlana's statement to Embassy officers it was clear that (a) she was
       not prepared to return to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>; (b) she wanted to stay
       in India but that this had been ruled out by the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> unless
       the Soviet Government would approve and she was told that such approval would not be
       forthcoming; (c) she wanted the assistance of the United States Government, at a minimum, to
       leave India and find a safe place to live and, at a maximum, to grant asylum in the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>; and (d) if she could not get <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
       assistance her only recourse would be to contact the press and appeal publicly for the help
       and support of the people of India and of the United States.</p>
                        <p>12. While awaiting response to the Embassy's cable to Washington I carefully
       reviewed the options with [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
        declassified</hi>] Roger Kirk and Richard Celeste. Four courses of action were
       discussed.</p>
                        <p>A. To deny Svetlana our assistance and encourage her to return to the Soviet Embassy
       compound;</p>
                        <p>B. To keep Svetlana in the Chancery or Roosevelt House until her future could be resolved
       with the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and the Soviet Government;</p>
                        <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0500"/>
                        <p>C. To grant her a visa to the United States (Svetlana's Soviet documentation was
       in order and unrestricted) which would enable her to leave India and proceed to another point
       while the matter was considered further;</p>
                        <p>D. To spirit Svetlana out of India covertly in the hope that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> role in her departure could be kept secret.</p>
                        <p>13. I immediately ruled out alternatives A and D. In regard to the first option to reject
       Svetlana's appeal for assistance would be completely contrary to our national
       tradition. When it became known that the United States Government had refused an appeal for
       assistance from the daughter of Joseph Stalin, the public outcry in the United States and
       elsewhere would have been overwhelming. Moreover, since she had stated her intention to make
       a public appeal if we refused to help her a profoundly embarrassing situation would also be
       created with the Governments of India and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>14. Since it was impossible to confirm Svetlana's identity during the brief time
       at our disposal, since the possibility of a Soviet provocation could not be ruled out and,
       most important, since any <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> role would almost certainly
       eventually come to light I considered that the fourth option, i.e. to spirit Svetlana out of
       India covertly, involved unacceptable and unnecessary risks.</p>
                        <p>15. Thus the choice was between keeping her in the Chancery and informing the Indian
       Government that she sought asylum in the United States, and assisting her to leave India as
       quickly as possible. Careful consideration was given to both alternatives.</p>
                        <p>16. If Svetlana had been kept at the Embassy and the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
       informed, an issue between our Governments and that of the Soviet Union would have been
       immediately joined. The Government of India, under heavy pressure from the Soviet Union,
       would have demanded Svetlana's “release” to Indian custody.
       We would have had to refuse since it was clear that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
       could not be relied upon to permit her to stay on in India peacefully. The fact that
       Stalin's daughter had sought and received refuge in the United States Embassy
       would become known within a short time and the Chancery and Roosevelt House would be besieged
       by the world press. Thus the matter would have become an issue between the three governments
       in a most contentious fashion and in a situation which would leave us little room for
       maneuver. A first class international Donneybrook would have been inevitable with the outcome
       unpredictable.</p>
                        <p>17. The appeal of assisting Svetlana to leave without officially deciding the matter of
       asylum in the United States was manifold. In the first place it could be done openly and
       legally since her Soviet and Indian documentation was in order. This would protect the United
       States against charges of another <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> plot and against the
       accusation of kidnapping <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473" facs="0501"/>her against her will.
       Secondly it would provide a breathing spell in which her future status could be considered
       without the direct glare of publicity and without the involvement of the new Government of
       India which would be almost certainly bound to bow to Soviet pressure if she were still in
       India.</p>
                        <p>18. At approximately 11:30 pm I decided that we should provide Svetlana with a visa and I
       confirmed the tentative arrangement to place Svetlana on the Qantas flight for Rome,
       accompanied by an American officer, unless we received contrary instructions from Washington
       in response to our earlier cable in the meantime.</p>
                        <p>19. With my concurrence Mr. Huey, the Consular Officer, endorsed a B–2 Visitor Visa in her
       passport, valid for one entry if used within three months (i.e. before June 6, 1967). The
       visa did not contain any mention of an INS waiver. Mr. Huey issued the visa on the
       understanding that in fact Svetlana would not proceed beyond Rome unless an appropriate
       determination were made in Washington that this was desirable. Only with such a valid visa
       would the commercial airlines accept Svetlana as a passenger to the West on the basis of her
       own documentation.</p>
                        <p>20. At 12:15 Svetlana was driven to the airport by Mr. Huey, accompanied by Marine Sgt.
       Michael Watson in civilian clothes and [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
        declassified</hi>] Roger Kirk. There they met [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
        text not declassified</hi>] who had proceeded to the airport to purchase the airline
       tickets. At Palam Airport Svetlana checked through both Government of India immigration
       procedures and Government of India customs procedures in the normal manner, using her own
       documentation. Thereafter she waited in the public international departure lounge at the
       airport for approximately one and a half hours (the plane departure, which had been scheduled
       for 0115, was delayed for an hour and a half due to a leak in its hydraulic system). The
       absence of any effort at secrecy or coercion can be and has been attested to by numerous
       Indian immigration, customs and airport officials as well as the airline officers and
       employees with whom Svetlana was in contact.</p>
                        <p>21. As no contrary instructions were received from Washington, at approximately 0245
       Svetlana departed New Delhi on the Quantas flight [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of

                        <p>Mr. Rostow said he had asked the Ambassador to come in in order to stress to him the
       seriousness with which we regard the latest incident involving violation by a Soviet trawler
       of waters off Alaska, which we have restricted for fishing rights. Mr. Rostow noted that the
       trawler which has just been apprehended by the Coast Guard within the 9-mile contiguous
        zone<note n="2" xml:id="d209fn2">On March 22 the trawler was observed by a U.S. Coast Guard
        aircraft fishing within the contiguous fishery zone at a point 5.5 miles from land near Seal
        Cape off Alaska. A Coast Guard cutter pursued the trawler into international waters and took
        it in tow. (State Department Activities Report, March 22; National Archives and Records
        Administration, RG 59, <gloss target="#t_SS1">S/S</gloss>-I Files: Lot 74 D 164)</note> had
       been observed previously in December fishing within the 3-mile territorial water limit in the
       Shumagin Islands area. This had been protested at the time to the Soviet Embassy but now the
       same trawler was involved in another incident. Further, Mr. Rostow noted several reports from
       Alaska that Soviet fishing vessels are concealing their hull identification numbers and that
       Soviet trawlers recently have damaged thousands of dollars worth of crabpots.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rostow said that the population in Alaska is aroused about the incidents involving
       Soviet trawlers and the Department is under a great deal of pressure from Alaskan officials
       as well as Congressional representatives to take a very strong stand on the incidents. Mr.
       Rostow mentioned that Senator Bartlett, who previously had approved the
       Administration's restraint in handling the case of the Soviet trawler apprehended
       early in March,<note n="3" xml:id="d209fn3">See <ref target="#d204">Document
        204</ref>.</note> has now said that he favors the strictest application of the applicable
       penalties and the maximum fine against the trawler.</p>
                        <pb n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0503"/>
                        <p>Mr. Rostow said that the Department is now considering its position in the matter and the
       nature of the advice it should give to the Justice Department. In this regard, it is most
       important that we have a clear understanding of the Soviet attitude toward these incidents
       and Soviet policy regarding them. It is one thing if the incidents which have taken place are
       isolated events resulting from an excess of zeal on the part of the captains of the fishing
       vessels. On the other hand, if it is a deliberate policy on the part of the Soviet fishing
       fleet to violate our regulations, this would obviously be much more serious. Mr. Rostow asked
       the Ambassador if the Soviet fishing fleets were under strict instructions to comply with
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> regulations.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he certainly assumed that the trawlers had instructions to observe
       the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> regulations; however, he would verify this with Moscow
       and would inform Mr. Rostow as soon as possible.<note n="4" xml:id="d209fn4">On March 25
        Alexander Zinchuk, Minister-Counselor at the Soviet Embassy, advised Rostow that masters of
        all Soviet fishing trawlers had been informed of new restrictions on foreign fishing in U.S.
        coastal waters and that Soviet masters who violated foreign fisheries laws were punished by
        Soviet law. A memorandum of their conversation is in the National Archives and Records
        Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1967–69 POL 33–4 <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Rostow concluded by stressing again the seriousness with which we view these incidents.
       He said that the Soviet Union had been given ample advance warning of our intention to
       establish the restricted zones and that an extended grace period had been given before we
       undertook to enforce the regulation. It would indeed be regrettable if these incidents were
       allowed to become another irritant in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations and
       he hoped the matter could be resolved satisfactorily.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> called on me this evening, at
       his request, and made to me the following oral statement on the case of Svetlana Alliluyeva,
       replying to my statement to him<note n="2" xml:id="d210fn2">See <ref target="#d206">Document
         206</ref>.</note> on the same matter:</p>
                        <p>“The assurances of the American side in connection with the case of S.
       Alliluyeva, relayed by <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>, have produced a rather
       strange impression. The U.S. Government is trying to impress us with the idea that it was not
       implicated in the departure of <persName corresp="#p_AS1">Alliluyeva</persName> from India
       and that allegedly it in general is not interested in the whole affair, having a clear
       understanding of the undesirable consequences it could have for Soviet-American relations.
       Moreover, the fact that <persName corresp="#p_AS1">Alliluyeva</persName> has not come to the
       U.S.A. is portrayed almost as a friendly gesture by the U.S. Government toward the
       U.S.S.R.</p>
                        <p>“Meanwhile, it is completely clear, even from the information passed by
        <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>, that it was American officials, including the
       American Ambassador to India, who organized the travel of <persName corresp="#p_AS1">Alliluyeva</persName> from New Delhi to Western Europe by the use of underhanded
       (nizkoprobnii) methods which could only be dictated by feelings of ill-will toward the State
       of which she is a citizen.</p>
                        <p>“Strictly speaking, we are not at all concerned here with the fact that
        <persName corresp="#p_AS1">Alliluyeva</persName> left India for some place or other. No one
       intended to prevent her from doing this. In what country or countries she is and how long she
       stays there is her personal affair. The attitude of the Soviet authorities toward this is
       clear from the very fact that she was given a visa for departure from the Soviet Union.
       Moreover, it has long been well-known that she is a person who is not completely sound
       (zdorovii) with pathological traits (elementi) which have been reflected in her general
       behaviour. Soviet authorities did not see any reason on the basis of this not to permit her
       to go abroad, but I am instructed to inform you of this aspect of the affair.</p>
                        <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477" facs="0505"/>
                        <p>“But what cannot but surprise us are the above-mentioned activities of U.S.
       representatives, and, consequently, of the U.S. Government. These activities are saturated
       with a spirit of open unfriendliness toward our country and are in direct conflict with
       statements about striving for an improvement in U.S.-U.S.S.R. relations. Indeed, there are in
       Soviet-American relations many problems with which one might be occupied with much greater
       benefit for both sides than fussing over dubious business of such a kind.</p>
                        <p>“This is what we wished to say about this matter with complete frankness, having
       in mind that what we have said would be brought to the attention of President Johnson.</p>
                        <p>“It is of course for the American side to draw the appropriate conclusions from
       all of this. We do not intend to suggest (podskazivat) to [the American side]<note n="3" xml:id="d210fn3">Brackets in the source text.</note> any sort of decisions on this
       score.”</p>
                        <p>At my request and only for my convenience in making an accurate report of the conversation,
       he left with me the attached copy of his talking notes in Russian.<note n="4" xml:id="d210fn4">Not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador I took note of his statement. I regretted that the Soviet authorities
       had seen fit to take the unhelpful attitudes indicated therein. As the Ambassador knew, we
       had been frank and straightforward and had tried to handle this matter in a way designed to
       avoid creating obstacles to our relationship; we would continue to do so. Ambassador
        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> nodded in what seemed to be an expression of
       personal agreement but made no comment. The Ambassador did, however, refer to the <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> report of McCloskey's press briefing which he said
       indicated the Department had approved in advance the issuance of a visa to <persName corresp="#p_AS1">Alliluyeva</persName>. I told him this was not true, and I thought it was
       unlikely that McCloskey could have said so. I had seen the statement he was to make to the
       press and it contained no such assertion.<note n="5" xml:id="d210fn5">Note: In fact,
        McCloskey following his reading of the authorized statement on March 22, 1967 did state in
        reply to a question that Washington had authorized the issuance of the visa by New Delhi.
        This, of course, was not true. [Footnote in the source text.]</note>

       brought him back to Moscow. He replied that government wanted to talk about Soviet-American
       relations but went on to say that question foremost on everyone's mind was
       Vietnam. He said many members of government were convinced that we were not ready for
       negotiations but were bent on achieving a military victory and that our peace moves were
       merely a screen to cover each escalation. He went over past history and cited as the most
       recent example our having proposed a withdrawal ten miles on each side of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and then almost immediately had bombed targets around Haiphong.
       This particularly concerned Soviets as their ships were frequently in the port.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that government was still
       considering the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> question but said that this like all
       other questions of relations with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was affected by the
       Vietnam problem.</p>
                        <p>3. He said Soviets would ratify Consular Convention in due course but they would probably
       ratify Treaty on Outer Space first.</p>

                        <p>Dear Tommy,</p>
                        <p>I have been trying to arrange a reconsideration of the approach to the Soviets about
       Vietnam we have discussed at intervals ever since I <pb n="479" xml:id="pg_479" facs="0507"/>came to the Department last fall. First my recent trip to Europe, then Punta del Este, and
       now Adenauer's funeral have caused delays.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, the process of hostilities in Vietnam asserts a dynamic force which continues to
       cause both of us great concern. We-we, the civilians, that is-have failed to produce a
       political solution for the war. It is almost reflexive action to allow more leeway to the
       soldiers, and especially to the Air Force. In turn, the pressure on China and the Soviet
       Union mounts.</p>
                        <p>Your interesting telegram No. 4491,<note n="2" xml:id="d212fn2">In telegram 4491, April 19,
         <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> questioned whether the

        possibility of peace negotiations. So far as the Soviet Union was concerned, <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> stated, initiatives with a remote chance of success,
        especially those involving the Soviets, “may be positively harmful as adding to
        Soviet suspicions of our sincerity.” For text, see <ref target="frus1964-68v05#d137">

       to get out of Europe. And they are letting it be known that they think the following somewhat
       inconsistent thoughts: (1) that we are not interested in negotiation, but in military
       victory, which they say is impossible; and (2) that the recent move towards
       détente was at our initiative; that we need a posture of détente with
       them for domestic purposes; and that so far we have given them nothing in return (never mind
       that we can't see what they have “given” us in this
       minuet).</p>
                        <p>Whatever these signals mean—whether they are preparations for serious talks
       between us, or serious warnings, or nothing in particular but noise—there is no
       doubt that at some point, over some issue, there is a risk of forcing them to a
       confrontation, and that the risk would be less if bombing could be confined to the
       infiltration routes. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> told me once there were
       some steps the Soviets could not tolerate. I suppose the loss of North Vietnam to the
       Communist camp would be one.</p>
                        <pb n="480" xml:id="pg_480" facs="0508"/>
                        <p>As you know, I have felt for some time that unless the war were settled, it would enter a
       more dangerous phase,—a phase of danger for the Soviet Union as well as for other
       people—and that sooner or later we should have to follow the procedure which, with
       some variations, led to the end of all the post-war crises, that is, a secret, low-keyed
       warning to the U.S.S.R., followed by joint or parallel U.S.-Soviet action to put out the
       fire.</p>
                        <p>I have recently checked with Dean Acheson about the stages of settlement in Korea.</p>
                        <p>The first step, according to Dean's recollection, was a talk between George
       Kennan and Malik in the middle of June, 1951. George was about to go back to Moscow as
       Ambassador. He asked to see Malik in New York to go over the list of new men in the Soviet
       Foreign Office. In the course of that talk, he was instructed to talk along these lines:
       “His boss (i.e., Dean Acheson) was beginning to wonder if Malik's boss
       knew where this thing was going. He couldn't figure out Soviet intentions. He
       hoped they knew. Did they really want a blow-up?”</p>
                        <p>A few days later (on June 23) Malik made a speech which contained a hint. We followed it up
       in Moscow. This led to Kaesong.</p>
                        <p>I'm checking the files. But I remember Dean telling the story the same way some
       years ago.</p>
                        <p>My thought, as you know, is to convey both a warning and an offer to the U.S.S.R.: a
       warning that the present course could get out of hand, with results no one wants; an offer,
       in the spirit of our “special relationship” to join with them in
       procedures that could bring this affair to an end.</p>
                        <p>The essence of that approach (at least the second part: there was no visible warning) was
       put to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> by the Secretary in January,<note n="6" xml:id="d212fn6">Regarding <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s
        conversation with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on January 5, see <ref target="frus1964-68v05#d7fn2">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1964–1968, vol. V, Document 7, footnote 2</ref>.
        The resulting Sunflower negotiations during January and February, in which <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> played a major role, are documented ibid.</note> and
       recently followed up by <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> and me. There are
       different ways to formulate the idea. It rests in the end on the assumption that we have a
       common interest in ending the war on the basis of the status quo ante, since further
       hostilities carry risks we both wish to avoid. How to get there? They will know best about
       how to bring influence on Hanoi. The essential is to face the issue in this form.</p>
                        <p>You say a proposal that the Soviet cut off aid to NVN could be interpreted as a move on our
       part to turn Hanoi over to the Chinese. Agreed. But it should be possible to meet that
       concern, both through our warning as to the alternatives, and through the suggestion that we
        <pb n="481" xml:id="pg_481" facs="0509"/>jointly guarantee the outcome of the settlement,
       directly or indirectly. In that connection, I am intrigued by recent Soviet moves with regard
       to Laos. The 1962 agreement<note n="7" xml:id="d212fn7">Dated July 23; for text, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1962,</hi> pp. 1075–1083.</note>
       rests on the notion of joint guarantee, after all.</p>
                        <p>I'm sure that some people in the Soviet Union would like to see us continue to
       flounder in Vietnam, and to have the President punished politically in 1968. Such a result
       would paralyze American foreign policy for the forseeable future, and open the door to a
       renewal (or should I say intensification?) of Soviet adventurism in the many soft
       under-bellies of the world.</p>
                        <p>Even though there are risks, as you say, that efforts to involve the Soviets may be
       misunderstood or rebuffed, I remain convinced that the time has come to try. The alternatives
       are all worse. And we've been rebuffed by experts, after all.</p>
                        <p>I should think that we have nothing to lose by moving forward, and a lot to gain, even if
       we do no more than deter and diminish Soviet military assistance to North Vietnam. It should
       not be hard to work out a formula both for the warning, and for the offer—a
       statement calculated to allow them political credit as peace makers if they want it, to meet
       their political interest in North Vietnam, and to point the way to stability.</p>
                        <p>This is the only path I can see now for reaching the posture you mention in paragraph 7 of
       your 4491.<note n="8" xml:id="d212fn8">In paragraph 7 <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> proposed making a dramatic announcement, such as of a substantial
        increase of U.S. forces in South Vietnam combined with a leveling off of the bombing of the
        North, that would hurt the Viet Cong at the same time that it reduced the risk of increased
        Soviet aid to the North. Such a course might reduce criticism at home and thus North
        Vietnam's hope of an early U.S. withdrawal.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>It might help counter Zhukov's campaign here-intended to make our flesh crawl-if
       you dropped the remark that some of your colleagues thought the situation in Vietnam was
       approaching that in Korea at the time of the Kennan-Malik talk.</p>

                        <p rend="center">The Problem</p>
                        <p>To examine the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s policies toward the
       Vietnam war and its views of relevant <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policies, and to
       estimate Soviet intentions in relation to that conflict.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>A. While the Soviet leaders see the war as advantageous to them in many ways, they also see
       disadvantages which make their options unpromising and hazardous. They probably believe that
       there is no prospect of movement toward a political solution for several months at best and
       appear to have concluded that for the time being they have no alternative but to help Hanoi
       to carry on the war, hoping that changes of attitude in either Hanoi or Washington, or both,
       will make a political solution possible later.</p>
                        <p>B. The Soviet leaders fear that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, in its impatience to
       get the war over, will escalate the conflict in a way which will increase the risks and costs
       for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>; in an effort to forestall this they are
       currently stressing their intention to move to more vigorous support of North Vietnam. We
       believe that during the coming months they will continue to supply equipment designed to
       strengthen air and coastal defenses in North Vietnam and to increase the firepower of both
       the regular North Vietnamese forces and the Communist forces fighting in the South.</p>
                        <p>C. Whether or not there are formal arrangements covering the transit of Soviet supplies
       across China, we believe that Peking will not pose serious obstacles to such transit. But the
       relations between Moscow and Peking are still fundamentally hostile, and their attitudes <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0511"/>toward major issues of war and peace in Vietnam will
       continue to differ profoundly.</p>
                        <p>D. The North Vietnamese at some point will probably press the Soviets for more
       sophisticated equipment than those types now arriving on the scene or in the pipeline. These
       might include cruise missiles and tactical rockets which could be used to support North
       Vietnamese operations in the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> area and against <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> warships. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> might believe
       it had to respond to such pressure, although it would be concerned that the use of such
       weapons would provoke a still more dangerous <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> response.</p>
                        <p>E. If the intensity of the conflict were to be increased by the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, we believe that at some point the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would
       create an atmosphere of heightened tension with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. The
       Soviets might take certain actions designed to bolster North Vietnam and to warn the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, such as the provision of limited numbers of volunteers or crews
       for defense equipment or possibly aircraft. They might also break off negotiations with the
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> on various subjects and suspend certain agreements now in
       effect. The mining or the blockade of the North Vietnamese coast would be most likely to
       provoke these responses, since this would constitute a direct challenge to the Soviets, and
       there would be little they could do on the scene. We do not think the Soviets are prepared to
       resort to strong and direct threats of general war as a means to protect North Vietnam or to
       preserve Soviet face.</p>
                        <p>F. There would also be a good chance that at some juncture the Soviets would exert strong
       efforts toward a political solution, but they would probably not make Hanoi's
       acceptance of talks an explicit condition of continued material support.</p>

                        <p>The Russians are once again putting pressure on us (<persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>) to reduce our present
       tough restrictions on access by Soviet ships to U.S. ports. On the face of it, they have a
       beef. They treat U.S. ships on a par with others. We keep them out of all but 12 of our
       ports, and put them through a lot of red tap, frisking, etc. before we let them in
       anywhere—restrictions which we do not apply to non-communist nations. The result
       is that they almost never use our ports. Our ships don't much use theirs either,
       but that is by choice.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of an interagency staff level recommendation, Nick Katzenbach suggests that we
       explore with key labor people (<persName corresp="#p_MG1">Meany</persName>, Gleason, et
       al)—and then on the Hill—the possibility of some careful easing of the
       restrictions. A brief summary of the kind of easing we have in mind is at Tab A.<note n="2" xml:id="d214fn2">Not printed.</note> It would be designed to forestall a row with Moscow,
       without any risk to the security of our ports. (The present arrangements were designed to
       keep the Russians from sneaking nuclear weapons into U.S. big-city harbors. This made some
       sense in the mid-50s before the Russians developed intercontinental missiles with hydrogen
       warheads. It makes little sense now. In any case, we would maintain enough control to hedge
       our bets.)</p>
                        <p>In any case, we must proceed carefully. This is the sort of thing that could cause a rapid
       rise of George Meany's temperature. And he would have plenty of allies among the
       more edgy of our security people, who tend to think there is a communist under every bed.</p>
                        <p>The recommendation to consult comes from <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>
       and has the support of the appropriate people in the other agencies, including Defense and

       right to expect they would be. As you know, we have repeatedly affirmed that we consider the
       Accords of 1954 as an adequate basis for peace insofar as North and South Viet Nam are
       concerned. Further, we have urged that international action be taken to assist Prince
       Sihanouk in maintaining the neutrality and territorial integrity of Cambodia. You are already
       familiar with a considerable number of proposals which we and others have made which could
       lead to a military de-escalation of the conflict. You are also aware of a number of steps
       which we have taken de facto in this direction without any response from Hanoi. We have been
       disappointed in this lack of response and will try to probe such a possibility further.
       Therefore, I urge you once again, as I did in my letter of December 6, 1966,<note n="4" xml:id="d215fn4">For text, see ibid., vol. IV, <ref target="#d330">Document

       in which your influence in Havana could be used to halt these dangerous activities.</p>
                        <p>Beyond these points of danger and conflict, there are two areas of opportunity where I
       deeply believe it is our common interest and common duty to humanity to achieve constructive
       results: the achievement of understandings which would limit our respective deployments of
        <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>'s and <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s and the negotiation of a non-proliferation treaty.<note n="7" xml:id="d215fn7">Documentation on negotiation of the non-proliferation treaty and initiation
        of strategic arms talks is ibid., volume XI.</note> These two enterprises are not explicitly
       linked; but I am sure you are conscious that our task of persuading the non-nuclear powers to
       accept a non-proliferation treaty would be greatly eased if you and we could demonstrate
       concurrently our will and ability to begin to bring the nuclear arms race under better
       control. I hope, therefore, your government will find it possible to respond positively to
       our proposals to enter into serious discussions on the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
       and <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> problem.</p>
                        <p>I am aware that neither of our nations fully controls the forces at work in Southeast Asia,
       the Middle East, or the Caribbean. Indeed, we cannot determine by ourselves whether a
       non-proliferation treaty will prove acceptable to the governments, parliaments, and peoples
       of the principal non-nuclear nations. Nevertheless, our influence in these matters remains
       formidable if it is used in the same direction. At this critical moment I believe we must try
       consciously to overcome the forces drawing us further away from each other and bring to bear
       our capacity to shape events along paths of moderation and peace.</p>

                            <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Foy D. Kohler</persName>, Deputy Under Secretary</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The Soviet Chargé d'Affaires called on me at 5:30 this afternoon at
       his request. Referring to penciled notes from time to time, he made roughly the following
       statement with respect to the case of Mrs. Svetlana Alliluyeva.</p>
                        <p>He said that in the view of the Soviet Government, the actions of the United States
       Government in this case were hostile toward them and contrary to the statement which I had
       made on March 10 to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d216fn2">See <ref target="#d206">Document 206</ref>.</note> In this connection, he
       referred to my statements at that time that we had trusted this case would not become an
       obstacle in relations between us, and had emphasized the President's sincerity in
       seeking to follow the line of normalizing relations. He also repeated that I had then wanted
       Moscow to believe that the United States Government in no way had a direct interest in this
       matter and was not interested in bringing her to the United States. Continuing, he said the
       Soviet Government had taken note of these statements but that almost at once, we had started
       to act in a contrary manner.</p>
                        <p>He said that Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_AS1">Alliluyeva</persName> was not a normal person
       but that there were distinct signs of mental disturbances in spite of which she was actually
       being exploited for concrete and definite political purposes. The Soviet side could not
       ignore the fact that this exploitation was deliberately timed to coincide with the date of
       great importance in the history of the Soviet Union. The question, therefore, arose as to
       whether the United States Government realized that there are many other problems in which
       both sides could be more profitably engaged than in intriguing in a matter of this kind.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet side, he continued, would point out that there were in the Soviet Union a number
       of people who have been anxious to write about events relating to the death of the late
       President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, and yet they had been restrained
       and were not allowed to elaborate on certain <pb n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0517"/>theories and arguments. The Soviets had not been guided by opportunistic motives but by
       realization that such things do no good.</p>
                        <p>Incidentally, he said, the Soviet side was guided by the same motivations in connection
       with the observations of the Secretary of State about Soviet statements relating to American
       personalities including the President of the United States.</p>
                        <p>To speak frankly, he said, whatever might be said about freedom of expression and the like
       in connection with Svetlana Alliluyeva, the Soviet side understood that everything which
       would be stated or written by her or ascribed to her would be coached and endorsed by the
       American side. Besides this, the Soviets knew very well the mental and intellectual
       capacities of Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_AS1">Alliluyeva</persName> herself.</p>
                        <p>In saying all this straightforwardly, the Soviet side was not pretending to give advice or
       to make recommendations as to particular steps. This was the business of the American side.
       But naturally, it was quite another matter as to what reaction and what response would follow
       the actions of the American side in the <persName corresp="#p_AS1">Alliluyeva</persName>
       case, what emotions it could stir up in the Soviet Union, and what its influence would be on
       relations between our two countries which even without all this are already strained
       enough.</p>
                        <p>After hearing him out, I told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TYN1">Tcherniakov</persName> that I
       would like to make some immediate remarks in reply, reserving the right to make further reply
       after fully studying his statement and consulting my superiors. I said first of all I wanted
       to reject any charge or implication of United States Government involvement or exploitation
       of Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_AS1">Alliluyeva</persName>. I could assure him, and I wanted
       him to assure the Soviet Government that no American official, indeed no official or any
       Agency of the American Government had been in touch with Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_AS1">Alliluyeva</persName> since she arrived in Switzerland. There was no question whatsoever of
       any intrigue or any coaching, or any approval of anything she had said, or might say. Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> had informed him, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TYN1">Tcherniakov</persName>, of the revalidation of a visitor's visa
       to Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_AS1">Alliluyeva</persName> and of the fact that she was coming
       to this country. This was an action which we had taken in conformity with American laws and
       traditions.</p>
                        <p>During the time when she had been in Switzerland, she had had an opportunity to decide what
       she wanted to do and where she wanted to go, whether it was to any country in the world, or
       whether it was to return to the Soviet Union. She had decided that she wished to come to the
       United States and in accordance with our laws and traditions she had been given a visa to do
       so. In the circumstances, however, there had been no question of defection or asylum, and she
       was here on a visitor's visa. She was completely free any day to go elsewhere or
       to return to the Soviet Union. She was in no sense in the custody or under the influence of
       the American Government or any agent or Agency of the American Government.</p>
                        <pb n="490" xml:id="pg_490" facs="0518"/>
                        <p>As to what she might say or write this was not only not under the control of the American
       Government, but could not be controlled by the American Government. Freedom of expression is
       embodied in our Constitution and even the President of the United States could not change
       this.</p>
                        <p>Incidentally, I added so far as the reported publication of her book was concerned, this
       would be the case even if she were not in the United States but still in the Soviet Union. If
       she had found a way to get her manuscript out as had Sinyavsky and Daniel, there was no way
       to prevent its publication in the United States even had we wished to do so.</p>
                        <p>Reviewing my own notes regarding this statement, I said that I failed to understand the
       reference to the death of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and could
       not accept any parallel whatsoever between this and the question of Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_AS1">Alliluyeva</persName>. I could not conceive that anyone in the Soviet Union
       was in a position to contribute any information about the death of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and that it would be very interesting if anyone were.
       So far as I knew the manuscript which Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_AS1">Alliluyeva</persName>
       would be having published not only in the United States but elsewhere concerned her own life
       and was written even before she left the Soviet Union having been brought out according to
       her own statement by “Indian friends”. We could not and would not
       object to any Soviet citizen publishing his own memoirs whether it was in the Soviet Union or
       outside the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, I said that I wanted to confirm every word that I had previously said
       to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on this subject. Furthermore,
       the spirit in which this was said remained unchanged. So far as we were concerned, we had not
       even known that Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_AS1">Alliluyeva</persName> was outside the Soviet
       Union until the minute she walked in the American Embassy in New Delhi. We had in no way had
       anything to do with her appearance there and except for the immediate assistance in her
       departure from India had had no contact with her whatsoever. The United States Government had
       no interest in exploiting her or influencing her. She was strictly a private person and
       operating in a private capacity. We continued to hope that this case would not be made into
       an obstacle in the relationship between the two countries.</p>
                        <p>At the end, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TYN1">Tcherniakov</persName> asked a couple of
       questions, in reply to which I pointed out that the United States Government owned only one
       publishing house, while the Soviet Government owned all in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. He then concluded by saying he was not in a position to add anything to the
       statement he had been instructed to make to me.</p>

       Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> informing him that the United

        <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> stressed that it was “very important

       he would be welcome to see him. He would invite him to visit him in the White House and would
       be glad to provide any type of hospitality or formality or informality that he would wish. If
       Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> wished to be away from the hurly-burly of
       a big city, the President would be glad to see him at Camp David where there would be
       facilities for any members of his party that he would wish to bring. This would give the
       opportunity for relaxed talks in a comfortable and isolated location.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he would promptly transmit the message. When I asked whether he thought
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> would in fact wish to see the President, he
       replied that he had not really discussed this matter and could not venture an opinion. I said
       that I imagined that if the two did meet the Chinese Communists and probably the Arabs would
       accuse us of collusion, but it personally seemed to me that it would be useful for the two to
       meet. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he had recommended to the
       Chairman that he come to New York as he had never been in the United States. He observed that
       we had opposed the calling of a special assembly. I said we had ourselves voted against it
       but had not tried to block it. We did not think that this was the way to deal seriously with
       the problem.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> inquired whether the Secretary would head our
       delegation. I replied I did not know and thought it likely he would at least <pb n="493" xml:id="pg_493" facs="0521"/>be in New York at some time during the proceedings. I said that
       in any event I thought I was sure that he would be happy to see Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I said I thought it was a shame that the Soviets had not cooperated with us in the Middle
       East, for if they had we could have prevented the conflict. I said that I would not like to
       be in the shoes of their military attaché in Cairo as they seemed to have made
       some serious misjudgments. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> emphasized that
       they had not trained the Egyptians although their technicians had helped in the delivery of
       specific equipment which was in fact of excellent quality. They had not, however, in any way
       trained the Egyptians in the handling of large bodies of troops. He also pointed out that
       most of the Egyptian planes had been destroyed on the ground. He asked why the Israeli had
       attacked and suggested that our people in Tel Aviv had surely been informed. I denied this
       vigorously and said the Israeli had promised us that they would not attack for a period of
       time in order to give us an opportunity to try to settle the problem and particularly the
       blocking of access to the Gulf of Aqaba. I said that this was the act which had caused
       matters to get out of control. The Israelis had made clear that this was casus belli.</p>
                        <p>I referred to my talk with Chernyakov and said we thought it most important that we not
       start the arms race in this area all over again. I said I was particularly thinking of the
       long range problem. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said the Arabs had lost a
       lot of matériel and were pressing hard for its replacement.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that the Soviets were ready to conclude
       the Non-proliferation Treaty and thought they were waiting now for our decision on the
       proposals made by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC1">Foster</persName>. I said I was not
       informed of the status of the problem but thought we were not far from an agreement.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he had been present during the use of
       the “Hot Line” together with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and asked if I had been present at this end. I replied that I had.
        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said they had wanted to send their message
       earlier, but he had reminded his people of the difference in time. I said that it had still
       been early in the morning here and hoped that they would keep this time differential in
       mind.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked about what he called our big problem,
       that is, Vietnam. He referred to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> offer for talks in
       the event we stopped bombing. I said that they had asked us to stop bombing unconditionally
       and permanently and had still given no indication they would not continue the infiltration of
       troops into the South. I said we were most anxious to resolve the problem either through
       negotiations or through a tapering off of the use of violence. I thought we were prepared to
       move any time the other side indicated directly or indirectly that they were prepared to
       reciprocate.</p>
                        <pb n="494" xml:id="pg_494" facs="0522"/>
                        <p>When I inquired why <persName corresp="#p_SVS1">Semenov</persName> was not on the Soviet
       delegation, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied that he was ill.</p>
                        <p>As we were walking toward the door, I expressed regret at the delay in carrying out our
       Civil Air Agreement. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he could assure me
       that the delay was not due to political reasons but simply the Soviet desire not to start
       with an outmoded plane and the problem of equipping it to meet our standards.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>In the event the President meets with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, some consideration should also be given to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s mood and perspective on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
       policy. It is quite likely that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> will be
       influenced by:</p>
                        <p>a. A sense of humiliation and frustration, brought on by recent events in the Middle East
       as well as by Soviet inability to deter the United States from bombing North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>b. A strong suspicion that the Soviet Union is facing “a general offensive by
       the forces of imperialism”. The Communist mind likes to reason in patterns and to
       detect broad trends. Accordingly, the Soviets are inclined to see a connection between events
       in Brazil, Ghana, Indonesia, Congo, the Dominican Republic, and Greece. To them, the recent
       hostilities in the Middle East were part of this general effort to install pro-US
       regimes—thus to topple Nasser and the pro-Soviet Syrian Government, with Israel
       acting as a front for the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Given that, it is rather important that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
       emerge from any eventual meeting with the President disabused of the notion that the <pb n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0523"/>United States is out to humiliate the Soviet Union and
       is currently engaged in a broad political offensive directed against it. Some gesture may be
       in order. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> should be made to feel that the
       President remains determined to pursue a policy of reconciliation, along the lines outlined
       in his speech of October 7th.<note n="2" xml:id="d219fn2">See <ref target="#d176">Document
         176</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>At the same time, it is also important that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
       does not leave with the erroneous impression-which apparently <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> took home with him from the Vienna meeting with President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>-that a policy of bluff and bluster will get the Soviet
       Union anywhere. He is not likely to do so if in the course of the conversations the essential
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> interests either in the Middle East or in
       Vietnam-interests which we cannot afford to compromise-are concretely and specifically
       spelled out to him. This would not only help to allay his ideologically-rooted suspicions; it
       would appeal both to his Russian common sense and to his communist sensitivity to realities
       of power.</p>

                        <p>1. The following is Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>'s
       memorandum of the message from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>:</p>
                        <p>“Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> telephoned me from
       New York to say that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> wished to thank him
       very much for the message from the President which I had transmitted to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d220fn2">See <ref target="#d218">Document 218</ref>.</note> The Chairman appreciated the invitation to visit the United
       States. Unfortunately, he was very busy and would not have time now to visit the United
       States. The Chairman did not plan to visit Washington. If the President wishes or has some
       plans to be in New York, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> will be ready to
       meet him in New York at any time or place convenient to the President.</p>

       York.”</p>
                        <p>2. We are now revising the speech which you would make at the State Department at 9:30 on
       Monday morning to include the other subjects along the lines of your suggestions. We hope the
       next draft can be in your hands later this evening.<note n="3" xml:id="d220fn3">For text of
        the President's June 19 address at the State Department's Foreign
        Policy Conference for Educators, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of

                        </p>
                        <p>3. The most serious question for you to consider is what to do about a meeting with
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName>, Rostow,
        <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> and McPherson and I discussed this question
       this afternoon. Our views may be summarized as follows:</p>
                        <p>(a) There is no need for you to rush up to New York to see <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> before his speech to the General Assembly. If the two of you meet before
       his speech, he might even be under pressure to be tougher in the General Assembly than he
       might otherwise-to avoid the impression among the Arabs or the Chinese that he was in some
       personal collusion with you. In any event, a tough speech by him after a meeting with you
       would make it appear that you had “failed” in your private talk with
       him.</p>
                        <p>(b) We do believe, pending some change in the situation, that there would be enormous
       political loss to you if <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> were to go home
       without a conversation between the two of you. We could not rely wholly upon his refusal to
       come to Washington since he has indicated that he would see you in New York. You should bear
       in mind that his theory is that he is visiting the United Nations and not the United States.
       It just happens that the United Nations is in the United States. You have said on other
       occasions that you would “go anywhere, see anybody” in the interest of
       peace. If it became generally known (as it would from the Russians) that you had refused to
       see <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> in New York, we believe that you would be
       under very severe domestic criticism-quite apart from international public opinion.</p>
                        <p>(c) There will be intense press interest in the question of whether the two of you will
       meet until the point is clarified. The Russians may do some leaking on their own. It is not
       clear, therefore, that the question can be held over until, say, next weekend.</p>
                        <p>(d) I would recommend that, in any event, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> proceed to New York on Sunday and have a long talk with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. Then, I would go on to New York on Tuesday and have a
       talk with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>.</p>
                        <pb n="497" xml:id="pg_497" facs="0525"/>
                        <p>(e) The group named above would recommend that you decide now that you will see <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> before his departure even if it means your going to the
       New York area. If you do that, you can also see <persName corresp="#p_KJO1">Krag</persName>,
       Wilson and one or two other Heads of Government who might be in New York at the same time.
       There would be considerable advantage in letting it be known early that you expect to see
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> in order to avoid a churning press. If you
       agree with us that it is important to see him before he leaves the United States, it would be
       better to make the arrangement early rather than appear to be submitting to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> or Congressional
       pressures.</p>
                        <p>(f) You need not go into New York City to see <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>; arrangements could be made to meet him at an estate on Long Island or
       in Westchester County. None of us thinks that your going to New York to see <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> would require you to appear in the General Assembly.
       You always have the option of appearing in the General Assembly if the course of Assembly
       discussion leads you to believe you would like to do so.</p>
                        <p>(g) If you do not wish to make a final decision before you hear <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s opening speech on Monday morning, <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Llewellyn Thompson</persName> could go back to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> with a message substantially as follows:</p>
                        <p>“The President regrets that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
       feels unable to visit Washington. The President will study his own schedule about other
       possibilities and will be pleased to know what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s own schedule is if that is now known.”</p>

                        <p>You have asked whether I believe a meeting between you and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> would be desirable. I favor such a meeting for the following
       reasons:</p>
                        <p>a. Assuming that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> meets you at least half way
       in making the arrangements, I cannot conceive of circumstances in which the personal,
       political, or diplomatic cost to you or to our nation would be significant.</p>
                        <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0526"/>
                        <p>b. The American public expects that you will meet with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, and unless the failure to meet is clearly his, the domestic and
       international price to you of a failure to meet could be substantial.</p>
                        <p>c. At a minimum you would take from the meeting an appraisal of <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> which should enable you to better predict his behavior and he, in turn,
       would better understand your character and the resolve with which you approach our
       commitments in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>d. There is a possibility, although I think the chances are less than even, that a meeting
       with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> would lead to progress toward: secret
       talks on Vietnam; limitations on the continuing expansion of the Soviet and U.S. strategic
       nuclear forces; control of arms deliveries to the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>In summary, assuming the meeting is arranged on the proper basis, I believe the potential
       costs to be small and the potential gains to be great.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>Walt passed me your request for a memo on a meeting with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Cons:</hi> 1. He has not gone at this in a gracious way, to <hi rend="italic">put</hi> it mildly, but he is within his rights in visiting the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and the custom of working by indirection goes back in the
       Russian character at least 200 years.</p>
                        <p>2. Very little of substance can come from the meeting, and it may even lead to a hard-nose
       standoff, <hi rend="italic">but</hi> the estimates of both hard- and soft-boiled
       demonologists run against such a result, and everyone knows that you are not the man to lose
       in a face-to-face encounter with anyone.</p>
                        <pb n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0527"/>
                        <p>3. After a week of pulling and hauling, some may call it a tactical surrender if you go
       near New York, but there are solutions to that in the neighborhood. Of those I have heard,
       the Governor's mansion at Princeton seems best.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Pros:</hi> 1. <hi rend="italic">If you meet him you avoid all the negative
        consequences of not meeting him.</hi> That avoidance in itself is a very large gain. If you
       do not meet <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, who has come as far as New York,
       the continuing noises (press and politicos) will be awful. I have had a great deal of free
       advice on this point from people I have not bothered you with.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">You get a measure of the man</hi>. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> is only one member of a committee, but he is one of the most important
       and certainly the best informed on foreign affairs. You will get a picture of him which can
       only be helpful to you.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> will get a measure of you</hi>. This is the
       most important point of all. You really do speak, on topics like Vietnam, wider contact, and
       the Middle East itself, in tones which are significantly different from those of your
       Secretary of State. In my judgment there is more prospect of Soviet help on Vietnam than they
       have ever given (though much less than Averell Harriman thinks). I think you can increase the
       prospect of such help and in particular I think that Johnson to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> is a vastly better channel than Johnson to Wilson to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, you could substantially improve <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>'s value to you and to the United States by emphasizing
       directly to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> your confidence in him.</p>
                        <p>In summary, I see no unmanageable risks in the meeting, modest but practical advantages in
       holding it, and very great penalties (both here and in friendly opinion abroad) if it does
       not occur.</p>
                        <p>In this as in other things, people everywhere apply a double standard to us and to the
       Soviets.</p>

        p.m.</date>
                        </dateline>
                        <p>Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>1. The case for seeing <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>:</p>
                        <p>—At home it will cover your flank to the left and among the columnists. If you
       don't do it, they will blame every difficulty that follows on the lack of a
       meeting. The Republicans will run on: I will go to Moscow.</p>
                        <p>—There is a 20% chance that it will have a net favorable effect in U.S.-Soviet
       policy;</p>
                        <p>—Given the present state of affairs, I think the chance is well under 10% that
       it could make things worse between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. (The trouble with Vienna was not
       the meeting itself, but that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had decided to
       see if he could break President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> on Berlin. I
       do not see the Soviets in an ultimatum mood on either Viet Nam or the Middle East at the
       moment. There is always, of course, the chance. But if the chance exists it is because the
       Soviet Government, which is a collective organization, has so decided. And we might as well
       get it straight and soon, as obscurely and later.)</p>
                        <p>2. On a cold, hard, objective basis I am confident that your net impact on <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> (and through him on his colleagues) will be positive. I
       have had the privilege of seeing you deal with a wide range of governmental leaders. Your
       batting average justifies this confidence. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
       should feel both the steel and compassion; the determination and flexibility; and, above all,
       your willingness to treat the Soviet Union as one of the two older responsible children in
       the human family if they will so behave.</p>
                        <p>For these reasons, on balance, I am for the meeting, if it can be arranged in ways which
       leave you feeling comfortable and not cornered. That is why I support strongly Maguire Air
       Force Base, although it's going to be a little tough for them to swallow.</p>
                        <p>3. What might come out of the meeting? Aside from your impact on <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, nothing hard that they have not already decided. But
       it could accelerate the pace.</p>
                        <p>4. With respect to the Middle East, they may have decided to move in time from a straight
       confrontation on the question of Israeli withdrawal to playing a role in a settlement. If so,
       that would emerge in <pb n="501" xml:id="pg_501" facs="0529"/>the days ahead via <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. You may be able to smoke out a little in advance.</p>
                        <p>5. With respect to <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> is in a position where he must
       give you a simple Yes-No answer on whether his government is willing to engage in serious
       talks. Again, that has probably been decided. It could be communicated diplomatically. You
       might, through this meeting, get authoritative word earlier than otherwise.</p>
                        <p>6. On the substantive side, the serious case for talking with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> is Viet Nam. Frankly, I am a little impressed by the fact that the North
       Vietnamese have initiated contacts with us at several points. I am impressed by the fact that
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> dropped “permanent”
       from his bombing formula. It may be that our polls, which show popular support for a harder
       policy, have led them to believe that they will not be saved by the election of 1968; they
       may believe that we are about to make important decisions to increase our forces and perhaps
       apply more pressure against the North; that the bombing we have been doing is too unpleasant
       to be accepted over a period of years ahead; that there is danger, if we proceed on our
       present track, of either a clear-cut Hanoi defeat or a U.S./Soviet confrontation which they
       do not want; and that Hanoi is coming to believe that time is no longer its friend.</p>
                        <p>7. If there is anything at all in this line of thought then, of course, a meeting with
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> could be most important. And certainly the
       most important thing on which you must make up your mind is what you say to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>—after hearing him out—on Viet
       Nam.</p>
                        <p>8. My own thoughts are not final, but here they are. You might say that he knows our
       commitment and our views; and that the formula of the Foreign Minister in Hanoi is not
       satisfactory to us. We cannot accept a stoppage of bombing simply for the possibility of
       talk. What are his views? If it emerges that he does not repeat the permanent formula and
       goes on to say he is sure talks could take place if we stop bombing unconditionally, you
       could then explain that so long as the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> is being violated
       you cannot make a commitment to stop bombing. You might ask him if they would respect the
        <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> if we stopped bombing the North. He is most unlikely to
       be able to give you a definite answer on this; but he might agree to find out.</p>
                        <p>You could then indicate that there is a certain urgency in this matter. Your forces are
       under great pressure. They are taking heavy casualties every week. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> is going out to review the situation and to make
       recommendations. You might then add this: every mature American remembers that we lost more
       casualties during the Panmunjom negotiating period than we did during the Korean War. The
       critical question that must be answered by Hanoi is whether they are or are not willing to
       make peace on the basis of the 1954 and 1962 agreements and leave the South Vietnamese to
       settle their own political <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0530"/>affairs on the basis of
       politics and not violence. We are looking for peace in Southeast Asia at the earliest
       possible time; but not on the basis of turning South Viet Nam over to North Viet Nam.</p>

       private exchanges with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>.</p>
                        <p>1. Non-Proliferation Treaty—Secretary said we had instructed our representative
       in Geneva to agree to tabling <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> with blank Article III<note n="3" xml:id="d224fn3">For additional discussion during 1967 of Article III, known as the

       article could be discussed further by <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Soviets
       subsequent to tabling. This could give other countries, particularly non-aligned, a chance to
       discuss other provisions of treaty. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he
       felt it would be preferable to agree between us on Article III before tabling treaty; in the
       long run, this procedure would save time.</p>
                        <p>On subject controls, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said we should use
       international organizations, not special groups or blocs which would involve discrimination.
        <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0531"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>
       thought this procedure would mean loss of signatures of important countries but <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> felt we should not be too pessimistic on this score.
       Secretary noted <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> countries couldn't
       agree to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s suggestion because de
       Gaulle has veto. He thought Soviets might use their influence with French to overcome this
       problem but <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said Soviets had already explained
       this to French, who did not agree.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> did not exclude possibility of tabling draft
        <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> with blank Article III. Even this might be a step
       forward. However, he felt other clauses of draft would be looked at as well. Re amendments he
       wondered if we were not worried about possibility that other countries would not be obliged
       to adopt amendments agreed between nuclear powers. Secretary responded negatively, noting
       that under our constitution we cannot accept situations where other countries could make
       treaty binding on US without our agreement. Secretary said that, of two alternate texts for
       amendments clause, we would prefer shorter version providing for agreement between nuclear
       signatories. This might cause problems with some non-nuclear powers but we have talked to
       NATO allies about both alternatives and there appears to be no problem on shorter
       version.</p>
                        <p>Secretary raised question of duration <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. Some countries
       feel they should not bind themselves forever; however, we feel withdrawal clause should take
       care of problem. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked what length of time
       might be acceptable if limit had to be placed on duration of <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. Secy said some countries have mentioned 25 years. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> did not specifically object, saying only, “In any case,
       treaty must be for long period of time.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> cautioned that even if Sovs agreed to table
       with blank Art III some further time might be needed on their side for consultation with
       allies. Secy said we had taken care of this with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies
       at Luxembourg and were prepared to go ahead at any time.</p>
                        <p>2. Exchange of Embassy Sites—There was brief discussion this subject with Secy
       emphasizing the ball now is in Sov court. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was
       uninformed on details, although <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said problem
       seemed to be that we had upped our demands as to site in Moscow. <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> explained our need for Congressional approval of transaction before
       final agreement for exchange of sites can be reached and emphasized necessity for obtaining a
       satisfactory site in Moscow.</p>
                        <p>3. Consular Treaty—Secy asked when Sovs would ratify. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> responded that <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s
       would ratify; their procedures were not yet fully completed but he foresaw no particular
       problem.</p>
                        <p>4. Outer Space Treaty—Queried on exchange of ratifications for <gloss target="#t_OST1">OST</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said there
       should be no difficulty and only question was to establish mutually convenient time.</p>
                        <pb n="504" xml:id="pg_504" facs="0532"/>
                        <p>5. Civil Air Agreement—<gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s said only problem
       holding them up was their desire use new jet transport plane on Moscow-<gloss target="#t_NY1">NY</gloss> service. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said IL–62 is already in
       use on Moscow-Khabarovsk run transporting cargo, but was still considered experimental since
       it had not passed all of its tests.</p>
                        <p>6. Viet-Nam—After dinner, Secy turned to Viet-Nam asking if <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s saw any procedures which could be used open up question for
       discussion. We are prepared for bilateral talks, a new Geneva conf, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> talks direct contacts with Hanoi-anything which could help bring conflict to an
       end.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, speaking for the first time during evening in
       Russian through interpreter, said one of methods Secy suggested could bring prospects for
       positive development, i.e., contacts between two sides. However, for this, an atmosphere must
       be created which would be conducive to talks and this must involve unconditional cessation of
       bombing of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> recalled that in past contacts between two sides had seemed to be
       developing but had broken off as result <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> escalation of
       bombing attacks. He thought there were possibilities for us to find solution to present
       highly complex situation if as first step we agreed to unconditional cessation of
       bombing.</p>
                        <p>Secy said Hanoi's position seems to be that pause in bombing is insufficient;
       that there must be permanent and unconditional cessation of bombing while they refuse to stop
       hostile activities on their side. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied
        <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s could not conduct negotiations for Hanoi. Only way to
       find out what would happen is to stop bombing unconditionally. <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s did not know whether <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would insist on
       formal statements in connection with cessation. Only way to find out is to take step of
       stopping bombing. Secy called attention to presence of two or three <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> divisions near <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and to continuation of Viet
       Cong attacks in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> during period in December when contacts
       were being sought through Poles. We had agreed to keep our bombing attacks ten miles away
       from center Hanoi and did this for several months but there was no reciprocity from <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> or Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>Secy noted our last efforts to make contact through <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
       reps in Moscow. He did not know if it was worthwhile to make another effort, but we were
       prepared to undertake it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said we were turning things topsy-turvey in
       wanting talks to precede end to bombing. Only way in which to create situation where talks
       could mature is to stop bombing unconditionally.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then developed thesis that fighting in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> was result national liberation struggle not directed from
       Hanoi. We were wrong to attempt shift blame for fighting to Hanoi. We should stop bombing
        <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and should put questions of political prestige into the
       background. <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s are convinced <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> will defend its rights to existence indefinitely <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0533"/>and if we count on successful military outcome we are making mistake. This
       could cause not only great sacrifices for us but also involve great dangers of widening
       conflict. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> seems to underestimate importance of what <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s
       say on this subject. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> doubted if other
       possibilities for solution mentioned earlier by Secretary, such as Geneva conf or <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, were realistic because necessary agreement by interested parties
       could not be obtained.</p>
                        <p>In response <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>'s question as to how
       we could find out manner in which Hanoi would interpret pause in bombing on our part,
        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said it would not be difficult for us to find
       out. He could not speak for <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> or transmit proposals to
       them. He thought we were exaggerating the problem. We should first have unconditional
       cessation of bombing and then we could have discussions. Secy asked what would happen if we
       stopped-would divisions on other side attack? <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
       replied that if bombing ceased, conditions would be created for establishing contacts and
       with contacts this type of problem could be discussed.</p>
                        <p>Secy again returned to problem of reciprocity. Ten thousand Americans have been killed in
       Viet-Nam and our people would not understand if attacks continued in South while we
       discontinued in North. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked why he proceeded
       on supposition that attacks in South would continue. We should find out ourselves.</p>
                        <p>7. Laos—Secy wondered if there was any possibility solving situation in Laos. He
       felt it was capable of being solved in short time. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> rejoined that our growing interference is basic problem. <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s were worried about our behavior in Laos which weakens
       arguments for observing Laos agreements. <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s are not present
       in Laos, but <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is. Secy asked if <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s would be prepared to call for full agreement of all parties re observance of
       Lao agreement. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s were ready if we were, but <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was in Laos and
       they were not. Secy pointed to 6,000 NVN troops left in northern Laos after agreements but
        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said this was one-sided information and fact
       remained US was interfering in Laos. <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was not in a good
       position to talk on non-interference in that country, whereas there is not one <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> soldier there.</p>
                        <p>Secy urged that <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s use their influence as co-chairman to
       bring about observance of agreement but <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
       repeated our presence weakens their position as co-chairman. When Secy pressed <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to join with other co-chairman to get all contending
       parties out of Laos, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said it would be better
       for <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> to undertake such responsibility.</p>
                        <p>Secy said our understanding of <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>-Pushkin
       agreement was that three powers of <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> could not use veto to
       restrict <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> activities. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s had different interpretation.
        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said there should be discussion between three
       political parties in Laos. He thought we were complicating coordination among the three
       parties <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0534"/>and he asserted our influence was greater
       with Souvanna Phouma than that of <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s.</p>
                        <p>After inconclusive discussion of background of assassination of former <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Pholsema, in which <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> sharply disagreed with views of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> side,
        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said in response to Secy's plea
       that we all act to support original agreement in Laos that <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s would like to see agreement and are prepared to consider “realistic
       proposals” without prejudice. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> did
       not exclude <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s would revert to Laos problem again.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Middle East with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>:</p>
                        <p>You know all the issues. I think what we need is to probe him on one basic point:</p>
                        <p>Do they want to cool it off, or heat it up again? They really do have the choice, in two
       main ways:</p>
                        <p>(1) How many planes and tanks they give <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Syria. (You
       can safely refer to “reports” of “hundreds” of
       tanks and planes, without making the reports your own-if he denies the reports you can press
       the value of your call for registration of arms shipments at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. This should be mentioned with emphasis somehow, or they'll think you
       didn't mean it in your speech.)<note n="2" xml:id="d225fn2">See <ref target="#d220fn3">footnote 3, Document 220</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>(2) Whether they join us in serious negotiations for a realistic peace, which our 5
       principles do aim for, or instead stick to unworkable propaganda positions. Specifically, you
       could note with satisfaction his acceptance of Israel as a state, and press him to get his
       friends to do the same. The question after that is maritime rights, and after that,
       recognized and secure boundaries. He'll talk withdrawal; we want withdrawal to
       peace, not to June 4.</p>
                        <p>We will match our policy to theirs. We have absolutely no desire for another arms race, nor
       do we seek any “confrontation” with them. <pb n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0535"/>We don't think the Middle East is a promising place for either of us
       to play such games in-the players there are too unpredictable. Moreover, we recognize that
       they can't make a 180 degree turn over-night, nor seem to abandon friends like
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>-dangerous, unreliable and ineffective though
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has proved. But every move toward peaceful and
       constructive positions will get full understanding and response from us.</p>
                        <p>On the <hi rend="italic">past</hi>, you may want to assure him categorically that we did
        <hi rend="italic">not</hi> know of Israeli decision of June 4 that they would have to react
       to the threat they faced. He does not need to be told that we weren't in the
       fighting itself—he knows.</p>
                        <p>On one separate point: Having been in Saigon at the time, I remember how much <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> resented our choice of that moment, when he was in
       Hanoi, for our first bombing attack. I think you ought to tell him—in a wholly
       private word—that you had no intention of involving him in any way-you had long
       since determined that you would <hi rend="italic">have</hi> to react at once to the next
       direct attack on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> installations there-and your hand was
       forced by the people who hit Pleiku. (I believe this quite personal concern of his is
       entirely separate from the general question of bombing.)</p>
                        <p>Finally, while I think you will want to be courteous and even gentle in tone, I think it
       will be important to be clear and firm in substance-your public language has been extremely
       moderate and generous, and we don't want him to miss your strength. The best way
       to show it will be if he tries any rough stuff—which I don't
       predict—but one way or another this old pro needs to take home a picture of your
       strength as well as your responsiveness.</p>

        President's Daily Diary)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Following are some personal suggestions for line President might use in opening
       discussion with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. Regret first meeting takes place against current background and that Chairman will not
       have opportunity see more of our country. Hopes someday conditions will permit him to see
       Soviet Union. Hopes Chairman has good impression from what he has seen of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> but New York international city and not typical.</p>
                        <p>3. President very conscious of heavy responsibility resting on our two countries in an
       atomic age because of their size and influence.</p>
                        <p>4. Unfortunately more than one government trying to cause trouble between us in
       short-sighted view of their narrow selfish interests. Important that we be frank with each
       other and have the kind of relations which will enable us to frustrate efforts of
       troublemakers. We believe in real co-existence and not mere absence of war between us. We
       must find way to prevent quarrels between other countries from involving us.</p>
                        <p>5. No desire and time available too short to engage in ideological discussion but one point
       worth mentioning. Soviets have advantage in fact they free to use leftists including
       Communist Parties in Western world to carry on ideological struggle. This possibility denied
       to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> but this does not concern us. Since we do not consider
       that whole world has to have same system. What does concern us is that Soviets seem to see
       pattern of anti-Soviet behavior in our policies everywhere in the world. For example they
       seem to consider our policies toward Vietnam and Syria and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> in same category. Essential difference is that Syrian and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Governments came into power largely by actions their own
       people. What we oppose in Vietnam and in some countries in Latin America is outside
       intervention to determine character of regimes in those countries.</p>
                        <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0537"/>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> seems to think we were trying to bring him
       down and there are some indications Soviet Government thinks downfall of Syrian Govt was
       objective of our policy. This quite untrue. We gave far more economic and military aid to
       Arabs than to Israel including very substantial economic aid to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. What many of these countries fail to understand is that while we do not wish
       to dictate their policies on basis our aid, our aid programs are in final analysis dependent
       upon what the Congress will provide and it is naturally affected when governments we are
       aiding engage in vicious attacks upon us. Some of the Arab countries that have broken
       relations with us have indicated they expect us to continue our economic aid. Soviets must
       have experienced some of same attitudes.</p>
                        <p>7. The most important thing in my view for President to get across is our desire to resolve
       current problems and work for better relations. We would be glad to see Soviet Union prosper.
       Essential that we not devote our energies to working against interests of the other or to let
       other small countries try to solve their problems by engaging the two of us in a head-on
       collision.</p>
                        <p>8. In Middle East we should work to remove the causes of tension in that area-in
       disarmament at least a freeze and later reduction-in the atomic field move quickly to try to
       prevent proliferation which now particularly important in Middle East. Most critical current
       problem remains problem Vietnam which we sincerely wish to settle.</p>

       him to express his regret that he was not able to arrange to extend his personal hospitality
       to the Chairman at the White House or Camp David. The President understood, however, the
       Chairman's concern with the General Assembly and how occupied he was. He hoped
       that on some other occasion he would be able to personally entertain him.</p>
                        <p>2. The President wanted, if the Chairman thought a meeting to be desirable, to suggest that
       they meet tomorrow without any formal agenda. Either side could bring up any questions they
       thought would contribute to a useful meeting. The President had in mind discussing
       nonproliferation, the missile problem—both offensive and defensive, the Middle
       East where we had some common points of interest but also some differences and perhaps
       Southeast Asia. If the Chairman thought a meeting would be useful the President suggested
       MacGuire Airforce Base in New Jersey. This was a federal government facility about one hour
       and 10 minutes drive from New York. The President would be glad to make a helicopter
       available and suggested the meeting might begin at eleven. They could have lunch and the
       President would have to depart about 2:30 or 3:00 in the afternoon.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that he had no objection to
       discussing the problems the Secretary had mentioned. The discussion should not be limited by
       a fixed agenda. He anticipated a general exchange of views in which each could explain their
       general position. What he was after was the answer to a question. What should we strive
       for.</p>
                        <p>4. The Secretary said no one can answer this question better than the President.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said this question was decisive for the
       Soviets. If this could be decided then all other matters would fall into place. He wished <pb n="511" xml:id="pg_511" facs="0539"/>to raise the question as to why the meeting should take
       place on a military base. Both he and the President were civilians engaged in a peaceful
       endeavor.</p>
                        <p>6. The Secretary said he wished to be quite frank. The location proposed would be quiet and
       secure. It was difficult for the President to arrange on short notice the communications he
       needed. He had an appointment to speak in California and could take off from the base
       directly after the meeting. He said the base was not bristling with guns. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said the important thing was to consider public
       opinion. People would wonder what we were trying to demonstrate. Perhaps a place could be
       found off the base. He was not objecting to the area. He stressed that in his view it was not
       in the President's interest to meet on a military base. Both countries had
       declared for a peaceful approach, they needed only one room for about four hours and even a
       hotel room would suffice. People would wonder whether we had wanted to show him our guns or
       rockets.</p>
                        <p>7. The Secretary said that this was President Johnson's third choice. His first
       being the White House and the second Camp David. If Camp David were chosen the Secretary
       could escort him there by helicopter. There had been no design to get <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> on the military base but the President's
       thought was a federal facility which we could control and arrange the necessary security and
       privacy.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said he understood but the people would
       not. Perhaps the meeting could be put off until Saturday in order to make better
       arrangements. He said perhaps Americans did not understand how Europeans looked on such
       questions and he repeated a meeting on a military base would not be in the interest of the
       President. He would be prepared to meet at 9 or 10 on Saturday. The meeting should serve the
       cause of peace and the solving of important world problems. He did not want this to be
       considered a meeting which would increase tension. He believed the President wanted it to be
       of a friendly character. He was not standing on formal consideration and did not want to make
       it more difficult for us. He appreciated the invitation to visit the White House but pointed
       out he was not on an official visit to the United States.</p>
                        <p>9. The Secretary asked if he could reconsider the suggestion of Camp David.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said he simply could not go there. This
       was not his caprice. He had to consider the reaction of public opinion. Perhaps we did not
       feel the same delicacy.</p>
                        <p>11. The Secretary said within the American scene a meeting on a base would not appear to us
       as it apparently would to them. A military base in our system did not have that character and
       a meeting on it would be more normal to us. A base was not just soldiers but a community
       which had schools, hospitals, residences, etc.</p>
                        <pb n="512" xml:id="pg_512" facs="0540"/>
                        <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> suggested they might go to a
       farmer's house. If they were in the Soviet Union this could be easily arranged for
       a meeting of a few hours.</p>
                        <p>13. The Secretary said he would report back to the President. It would be difficult to
       propose a fourth site. The Chairman has his problems but the President has problems of his
       own.</p>
                        <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said the public need not know of other
       sites and the one selected could be presented as the President's proposal.</p>
                        <p>15. The Secretary said he understood that the Chairman was stating a preference but did the
       Chairman wish him to say to the President that he could not meet at the base.</p>
                        <p>16. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said he did not want the matter put in
       such black and white terms but he wanted to ask the President that he take his views into
       consideration. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that if it would help
       matters he could meet at any time on Saturday.</p>

                        <p>At 10:40 a.m. on June 23, 1967, President Johnson arrived by helicopter at the campus of
       Glassboro State College in Glassboro, New Jersey, for his first and only summit meeting with
       a Soviet leader. Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> arrived by
       automobile at 11:22 a.m. At 11:30 the two men began the first of three private meetings, two
       on June 23 and one on June 25, all of which were held in the study at Hollybush, the large
       stone home of the college president, Dr. Thomas E. Robinson. In addition, Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and President Johnson together with their delegations
       met both days for luncheon in the dining room at Hollybush. (Johnson Library,
       President's Daily Diary)</p>
                        <p>According to the President's memoir, <hi rend="italic">The Vantage Point,</hi>
       page 482, Glassboro, which had been proposed as a site the day before by New Jersey Governor
       Richard J. Hughes, offered several advantages: it was a small college town near the midpoint
       between New York and Washington and only 18 miles from the Philadelphia International Airport
       and 10 miles from the New Jersey Turnpike. The decision to hold the summit at Glassboro was
       announced at 6:35 p.m. on June 22.</p>
                        <p>Following their meetings on June 23, the two leaders made brief remarks to the press,
       indicating that they would resume their discussions at 1:30 p.m. on June 25. For text, see

        <pb n="513" xml:id="pg_513" facs="0541"/>Johnson then flew to Los Angeles to deliver a
       speech that evening at the President's Club dinner, following which he flew to his
       ranch in Texas. The morning of June 25 he flew from Texas to Philadelphia, arriving by
       helicopter at Glassboro at 12:41 p.m. The Soviet delegation arrived at 1:31 p.m. The U.S. and
       Soviet delegations met for luncheon at 1:50, followed by a private meeting between President
       Johnson and Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. (Johnson Library,

                        <p>To Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s apologies for
       having caused the President some difficulty in selecting a place for the meeting, the
       President replied that he was not concerned with minor items; he was happy to welcome the
       Chairman to this country and particularly to this meeting, and he was hopeful that they would
       get to know each other and understand each other better.</p>
                        <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that there was a great deal of
       clarification needed in order to understand each other's actions, particularly
       during the recent period of time. The direction that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy
       was taking was not clear to him and to his colleagues in the Government of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Therefore, he proposed to take advantage of this meeting in
       order to better understand us and to be better understood by us. He did not expect to reach
       all-encompassing global solutions here, but if the President and he could at least reach
       agreement on some problems, that would be of mutual advantage and would contribute to a
       better understanding.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that he quite agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s view of the purpose of the present meeting and remarked
       that perhaps we were poor communicators. He knew that sometimes this was the case between
       himself and our own people and that perhaps a better job of communicating was required
       between him and the Chairman. He knew very well that the major question with which he and the
       Chairman would have to deal was whether or not they agreed on the kind of world that we would
       like to live in, and also whether we could use the great strength and the vast resources of
       the two countries to contribute <pb n="515" xml:id="pg_515" facs="0543"/>to the goal of
       creating such a world. The President believed that the American people want to live in peace
       and harmony with the Russian people, in agreement and as friends with them. He knew that he
       wanted to cooperate with the Chairman and the leaders of his country and with the people of
       the Soviet Union to help bring about peace in the world so as to prevent the holocaust that
       could come about otherwise. Inquiring of the Chairman as to the size of his family, and
       learning that there were just two children, i.e., Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and his sister, the President remarked that he was one of five children
       in his family. It often happened that the oldest brother, himself, and the oldest sister had
       to take special pains in order to avoid disputes and differences between them so as to set a
       good example for the other children in the family. Frequently, the oldest brother has to
       provide guidance to the rest of the children. While he did not want to appear to be
       paternalistic towards the Chairman's country, and its leaders, he thought that if
       we could work more closely together, the two countries could ultimately develop and multiply
       their resources so as to help their peoples to a better life. The President thought that
       Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> was an excellent communicator,
       particularly because of his great friendship with the Russian people. He wanted the Chairman
       to know that the Ambassador was fully authorized to speak for the President and on his
       behalf. The President said that he also had a great deal of respect for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> whose representation of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in this country was of a very high quality indeed. For all the above reasons,
       the President thought that if we could build upon the fact that while we have difficult
       problems, we did have the same goals, this would be a useful and constructive attitude to
       take for the leadership of both countries. In 3 or 4 instances, we had already made a good
       beginning. The President hoped that his grandson would not have to experience a Pearl Harbor
       or a Siege of Leningrad or any other kind of war-connected calamity. He was sure that
       Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> felt the same way and thought it
       necessary to move further in that direction.</p>
                        <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that whenever we discussed any
       problem on a global scale, it seemed to him that there was complete agreement between the
       President's view and his own. But he had to emphasize here that this was true of
       this overall global aspect only. We have the same goals, neither country wanted war, and
       everything else that the President had said he could endorse. However, it seemed to him that
       when we began to discuss specific problems and practical steps for their solution, then a
       great many difficulties and differences arose. As concerns Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>,
       he quite agreed that they did an outstanding job in representing their countries and he also
       wanted the President to know that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
       kept in very close touch with the situation in the United States and transmitted very careful
       reports to his Government. He believed that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            <pb n="516" xml:id="pg_516" facs="0544"/>had a thorough understanding of the situation in the
       United States and that his reports were objective and correct. The Ambassador had not in any
       instance attempted to inform his Government in any way calculated to disturb relations
       between the two countries.</p>
                        <p> Inasmuch as the President had inquired about the Chairman's family, Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> wanted to enlarge on this question and said
       that his mother had died when he was only 2 years old and that his father, who had never
       remarried, had brought him up with the help of his grandfather and other relatives. Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> came from Leningrad as did his ancestors and
       they had all been workers, his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather before him. He
       himself had also been a factory worker and since the President had mentioned Leningrad, he
       wanted him to know that he had spent the entire siege during World War II in Leningrad as a
       representative of the Soviet Union's defense, later as the chairman of the
       Leningrad Soviet. He had a very clear understanding therefore as to the true meaning of war;
       he had experienced two world wars personally. He also knew that the President had fought in
       World War II and had a good understanding of what war was really like. Personally, he
       believed it was not just the two of them but all the nations and all peoples who had a good
       knowledge of the horrors of war and everything they implied. For this reason, everyone would
       say that he and the President had to do all in their power to maintain and strengthen peace
       in the world. He regarded this not only as their greatest duty but also as a deep personal
       moral obligation. Taking the Middle East situation for example, just as soon as the fighting
       had begun, he and the President had communicated with each other on the Hot Line and while,
       of course, they had not accomplished everything to settle the issue, perhaps in some way this
       direct communication had been useful. He wanted to tell the President very frankly and
       clearly that he and his Government were dismayed by the fact that the President had taken a
       certain position with which they had agreed, but then a few hours later had changed it
       radically. This had caused a great deal of worry and concern for him and his colleagues in
       the Soviet Government and had indeed alarmed them. He was speaking very frankly and
       sincerely; he did not know whether he would have another chance to meet with the President
       and therefore wanted to take advantage of this meeting for a frank and outspoken exchange. If
       the President wanted him to be specific, he would be glad to explain what he meant
       subsequently. But first, he wanted to say that just before leaving Moscow, his Party and his
       Government had asked him to assure the President that they all very much wanted this period
       of their lives to be devoted to peaceful purposes and the future to better relations with the
       United States.</p>
                        <p>He, his Party and his Government, were totally opposed to war. But if a war should be
       forced upon them, then the Communist Party <pb n="517" xml:id="pg_517" facs="0545"/>and the
       Government and people of the Soviet Union would know how to fight and would know how to
       defend their people; this was not, however, what they wanted. They wanted to do everything in
       their power to develop peaceful and amicable relations with all the countries of the world.
       History had entrusted him and the President with great responsibility in this respect. Not
       everything in this world could be measured in rubles or dollars; there were many other
       overriding humane considerations which had to guide their work in the direction of developing
       peace in the world and providing their peoples with a better standard of living. To this they
       devoted all their activities and efforts and he was sure that on this basis fruitful
       cooperation between the two countries could be established. As he saw it, the path to this
       goal consisted above all in trust for each other. If the situation could be attained where
       Americans could trust the Soviet people and the Soviet people could trust Americans, then he
       felt many questions facing us would lend themselves to a comparatively easy solution. He
       would like to attain such a situation, but to do so a great many steps in that direction were
       required.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he shared the Chairman's views; he knew they had been
       stated sincerely and believed that the Soviet people and the American people could easily
       agree on that kind of a platform. He recognized the wisdom and desirability of the exchange
       of views initiated by the Chairman on the Hot Line, he welcomed this initiative, and wanted
       to state emphatically that he was unaware of any change in the American position mentioned by
       the Chairman. We had brought our influence to bear in the interests of preserving the peace;
       we had asked for restraint and had urged Israel to agree not to abandon it. We had not known
       of any plans for military actions until they had begun and he was certain that the Chairman
       had not known and had not been consulted on the act of closing the Straits before it had been
       taken. This illustrated the great responsibilities of the two powers; the other countries
       were a part of the family but it was up to the older brothers to provide proper
        guidance.<note n="2" xml:id="d229fn2">See <ref target="#d219fn1">footnote 1, Document
         219</ref>.</note> As a result of the Chairman's communications, we had gotten
       busy and it was perhaps a result of the initiative displayed by the Chairman that we had
       managed to alleviate the situation, even if only temporarily. The big question was really
       this: if we could achieve some measure of success after the fighting had already started, why
       could we not have done so before the start of hostilities? We appreciated what the Chairman
       had done in this respect.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> fully concurred with the
       President's view. Once we had acted together, we had achieved some measure of
       success in bringing <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0546"/>about a cease-fire between
       Israel and the Arab countries; this was good and he was very grateful. However, when he had
       seen before the fighting had started that a military conflict was about to break out, he and
       his Government had contacted the Arab countries with a view to discourage them from starting
       a war and evidently they had been successful in accomplishing this. It appeared to him that
       the United States had not been successful in influencing Israel in the same direction.</p>
                        <p>The President remarked that he did not think either of the two big powers had been
       successful in this respect since it was the Arabs who had taken the first act of closing the
       Straits.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was quite emphatic in feeling that the
       Arabs had heeded his advice.</p>
                        <p>The President repeated his statement concerning the Straits and asserted that both great
       powers had succeeded in helping to bring about the cease-fire and to allow tempers to cool.
       He was concerned, however, over the fact that this had not been accomplished before the
       outbreak of shooting. He did not believe that the Soviet Union had wanted the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to close the Straits of Tiran or that it had wanted to see the
       Arab countries undertake military movements on Israel's border and publicly make
       many statements of their intention to liquidate Israel. He had said to the Foreign Ministers
       that he would like to see this discussed in the United Nations in the hope that neither side
       would undertake steps which later both might regret. Perhaps the very fact that all of these
       countries had at their disposal weapons, some provided by the Soviet Union and some by the
       U.S., had permitted them to become that reckless. The President hoped that his proposal for
       full disclosure of arms shipments to the Mid-Eastern countries in addition to an agreement
       not to furnish arms to them would in the future result in restraint being exercised by both
       sides. He hoped that we could agree on such steps with Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. At this point, the President told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> an anecdote about the English writer Charles Lamb. Once, when he had
       laid aside a book he had been reading, in obvious displeasure and had said to his sister that
       he did not like the author, his sister asked him if he knew the author. To this Lamb replied
       that he did not, that if he had known him he would have liked him. The President expressed
       his view that he thought a similar principle applied to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and himself, that in getting to know each other better, they were also
       getting to like each other.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> replied with respect to disclosure of
       arms shipments and refusal to ship arms to the Middle East that quite frankly he did not
       think this approach to be realistic at the current stage. However, he wanted to return to the
       previous question concerning the Hot Line communications. As he and his Government had
       understood the first exchange, the positions of the two countries calling for a cease-fire
       and <pb n="519" xml:id="pg_519" facs="0547"/>a return to the original armistice lines had
       been as one. But then, four hours later, as the military situation had changed, the President
       had also changed his view.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that we had not changed our view; that we still adhere to the same
       principle of preserving the territorial integrity of all countries. This was the policy of
       our Government and we have stated it to Israel and to other countries just as we are stating
       it right now with respect to Viet-Nam. We believe in the territorial integrity of all
       countries and we want everybody to abide by it. He was not aware of any change in the
       position of the United States not only on this occasion but also on all past and present
       matters. Certainly, there was no such change of view involved in the exchanges on the Hot
       Line. He said that he knew that if we could accomplish what he believed we had helped to
       accomplish before hostilities started, this would have been useful, Nasser would not have
       closed the Gulf of Aqaba and there would have been no destruction as a result of Israeli Air
       Force action. If no nation had supplied arms to the Middle Eastern countries, none of these
       war-like acts would have been taken. The President hoped that if we could reach agreement
       between ourselves with respect to the great problems facing us, we would be responding to
       what was expected of us by our people. This is why we wanted to explore the questions of
       restraint in developing anti-ballistic missiles systems and inter-continental ballistic
       systems with the government of the Soviet Union, so as to be able to devote the 40 or 50
       billion dollars an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system would cost to the peaceful
       development of our country. The President was sure that neither people wanted to use these
       weapons against the other and therefore believed that if we could manage to reach that kind
       of agreement it would be very helpful to both countries. We did want to live in peace-the
       question was how? He thought that an understanding not to furnish arms to either side in the
       Middle East, an agreement concerning the ABM systems, a solution of the problems in South
       Viet-Nam and a cessation of hostilities with North Viet-Nam, that all of these constitute a
       reply to the above question of how to live in peace.</p>
                        <p>In 1948 both the Soviet Union and the United States had agreed that Israel was entitled to
       a national life of its own and this had a bearing on a solution to the Mid-East problem. The
       President did not think either side had worked hard enough to reach agreement on these
       questions. He wanted to suggest these measures to the Chairman, measures for arms control,
       ABM control, Viet-Nam, Middle East, and some steps for a solution to certain problems of
       mutual interest in Europe. He would be glad to hear the Chairman's view concerning
       them. Our peoples were asking us to find solutions and he thought that if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and he could understand each other and like each other
       on the principle illustrated by the Lamb anecdote, progress could be made. Neither of our
       peoples wanted to cause harm to the other. Therefore, <pb n="520" xml:id="pg_520" facs="0548"/>perhaps extended discussions of all these problems could accomplish some progress in the
       direction of finding solutions. Our people want us to have confidence and trust in each other
       and perhaps the action decided upon here in this little farm house could represent first
       steps in this direction. The President would rather leave that kind of a monument of his work
       than any other and he was sure that this was also true of the Chairman.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> assured the President that he took the
       same view but as the President probably knew this was not such a simple matter. He wanted to
       return to the first question concerning the situation in the Middle East. What was it that
       could be undertaken now with respect to the Middle East on which the two countries could
       agree? First of all, he wanted to emphasize the Soviet Union had no commercial interest in
       the Middle East, that it was not deriving any economic benefits from the resources of the
       Middle East such as oil (the Soviet Union had ample oil resources of its own); all that the
       Soviet Union was doing was investing in development projects in Mid-Eastern countries,
       exemplified best of all by the Aswan Dam. Presently an agreement was being worked out to
       build a similar dam on the Euphrates River. None of these were military projects. He did not
       know whether the President had ever visited the Middle East; if he had, he surely would be
       appalled at the great poverty of its people-and all this while there were enormous sources of
       energy available. The Soviet Union could not be accused, as perhaps Great Britain could be,
       of self-serving commercial interests in that area. The Soviet Union was only investing there
       to raise the standard of living of other countries and would wish to see the United States do
       the same; the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was not as rich a country as the United
       States and yet it was doing all in its power to help the impoverished people of the Middle
       East. Now, to turn to the question of what could be done to solve the problems of the Middle
       East, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> drew a sketch of the Suez Canal
       indicating Israeli forces occupying the eastern bank and Egyptian forces, regrouping after
       the initial shock, on the western bank. He said that renewed hostilities along the Suez,
       which was now the front line, would be inevitable unless the two warring military forces
       could be separated. It was not reasonable to expect the Arabs to withdraw any further;
       therefore, it was clear that Israel would have to withdraw its forces back to the original
       armistice line. If this were not done, hostilities were certain to break out again; the Arabs
       were an explosive people and no other solution to this problem was possible.</p>
                        <p>The President asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> to consider the
       record of the past three years of his Presidency. During that period of time, we have not
       concluded any new military alliances with other countries. We have concluded a cultural
       exchange agreement with the Soviet Union, although its implementation had been hampered to
       some extent by the <pb n="521" xml:id="pg_521" facs="0549"/>rejection of Mary
       Martin's show “Hello Dolly” on the part of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> following initial acceptance. We had concluded a civil air
       agreement, we had concluded and ratified a consular agreement and we had concluded an
       agreement on the peaceful exploration of outer space. The President hoped that today we could
       agree that a non-proliferation agreement be actually tabled before the other countries
       concerned become disgusted with the endless delays which have occurred. Further, the
       President hoped that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> could assure him that
       Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> would get to talk to his
       representatives concerning control of the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> race. He hoped
       we could announce that such talks would take place. Three months ago the Chairman had
       informed him that he was prepared to undertake such discussions, yet nothing further had
       happened. Thus we could point to four finished and completed measures undertaken by the two
       countries during the past three years, none of which were war-like or had any military
       connotations. We should agree now to table a non-proliferation agreement and we should be
       able to tell our people today that we would undertake discussions concerning the ABM systems;
       even if we disagreed on many aspects of this problem, the discussions in themselves would
       prove to be a step in the right direction. Regarding arrangements to control the Middle East
       situation, the President would like to have Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s views regarding the five points he had proposed, national
       life, territorial integrity, etc. Perhaps agreement could be reached on some of these and
       perhaps Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> might have some proposals which
       the President could agree to. The President emphasized that he did not doubt that Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> wanted the same thing as he, and he knew what
       he wanted. The President did not like to see one-half of our budget devoted to military
       expenditures. Soon after he had become President, he had addressed a letter to the
       then-Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in which he had proposed that
       the military budgets of both countries be reduced. This was before the Viet-Nam conflict,
       before the aggression of North Viet-Nam against South Viet-Nam. This, however, was another
       subject to be explored; right now the President felt we had the opportunity to take effective
       steps in the interests of world peace as outlined above.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> repeated that on the whole, on a global
       scale, he agreed with the President but that he was disturbed when it came to discussion of
       specific points and proposed measures. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
       repeated his view of the Suez Canal situation. He continued that mankind would not forgive
       him nor the President for wasting one-half of the resources of the two countries on military
       expenditures. Weapons were built, became obsolete and were discarded. Yet, in his view, it
       was the United States that was being carried away by the military situation, as if driven to
       it by some force. The military budget was being increased constantly and this forced the
       Soviet Union to keep up and increase its own military budget. Once we had told you two years
       ago that we proposed <pb n="522" xml:id="pg_522" facs="0550"/>reduction of military
       expenditures by mutual example. The Soviet Union had followed through; yet because of the
       Viet-Nam situation, or Korea, or some other reason, the United States had increased its
       budget and forced a reversal of Soviet policy. This has become a race. The United States
       increased its military budget and then the Soviet Union had to follow suit although it was
       the United States which was always ahead, with the Soviet Union merely following its lead. As
       concerns the President's view on the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system,
       it was not anti-ballistic missiles that were the root and the cause of trouble and tension in
       the world. To a much greater extent this was due to the development beyond reason of
       offensive weapons systems.</p>
                        <p>The President told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> that he was under
       pressure on the part of many people in this country to adopt the decision of spending some
       $40 billion for the development of an anti-ballistic missile system. He had not taken a
       decision as yet and did not want to take it without at least first having had a chance to
       explore all possibilities of avoiding such a race with the Soviet Union. He had brought
       Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to this meeting and Secretary
        <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> was anxious to sit down with Soviet
       military representatives to discuss and explore possibilities of preventing an ABM race
       between the two countries. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> could
       say everything here in five minutes that the President had expounded in his letter. He knew
       better than anyone else how quickly weapons became obsolete and turned to junk and therefore
       was more aware than others of the need to hold down the arms race. Thus, if the experts could
       examine the problems and present drafts to deal with them this could be announced today as
       one of the results of the present meeting. The President would also hope today to be able to
       state that the two countries were prepared to table a non-proliferation treaty. As for
       Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, he was willing to meet with
       Soviet representatives at any time in Geneva or elsewhere in order to reduce the $73 billion
       military budget we were now faced with. Perhaps Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> could suggest how such discussions could be started. If these points
       could be announced today, i.e., non-proliferation, arms disclosure, ABM discussions, the
       world would salute the two leaders for what they had accomplished. People in our country and
       indeed throughout the world were already recognizing the initiative which had brought about
       this meeting.</p>
                        <p>As for Viet-Nam (the President drew a sketch of North and South Viet-Nam separated by the
        <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>), he wanted Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> to understand the following: North Vietnamese soldiers were being sent
       through the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> to attack South Viet-Nam. Some of our
       military people advocated our replying in kind. We did not however want to conquer North
       Viet-Nam, we merely wanted to prevent the North Vietnamese from completing their aggression
       against South Viet-Nam. It was for this reason that we sent planes to North Viet-Nam to bomb
       instead <pb n="523" xml:id="pg_523" facs="0551"/>of men to fight. If we could get the North
       Vietnamese to stay north of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, our people would remain
       south of it, and the bombing cease. In that case, the co-chairmen of the Geneva Accords would
       have a chance to supervise free elections in South Viet-Nam and the people of South Viet-Nam
       would be given a chance to express their view as to what government they wanted to have. All
       we were being told, however, was for you to stop the bombing. Our reply to this is if we did
       stop what could we expect in return? We know that ultimately we can do no better than to let
       self-determination in South Viet-Nam prevail and we think you know this also. Perhaps today
       there was not enough time to discuss all of these problems, perhaps the Chairman could
       suggest some additional steps to be discussed at a later date, but the President did want him
       to be quite sure that the United States had no desire to conquer North Viet-Nam. If the three
       billion people of this world could be informed today that Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and President Johnson had made some progress in the
       direction of resolving some of the problems between them, this would represent a great step
       forward and would be universally acclaimed.</p>
                        <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, returning to the question of the
       Middle-East asked the President if he was informed of the conversation which took place last
       night between Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Dr. Fawzi, Deputy
       Prime Minister of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.<note n="3" xml:id="d229fn3">The
        memorandum of their conversation is scheduled for publication in <ref target="frus1964-68v19">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1964–1968, volume XIX</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The President replied that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had only
       briefly informed him of the conversation since they had not as yet had a chance to talk to
       each other. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> continued to the effect that
       Dr. Fawzi had first called on him and then on Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had asked Dr. Fawzi to
       explain the position of the UAR concerning the Gulf of Aqaba. In Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s opinion the situation along the Suez Canal
       was most acute, the Canal was blocked and paralyzed and would remain this way as long as
       Israeli forces remain on the East Bank. He was sure that the President would agree that the
       Arabs could not withdraw any further. Therefore the Jews had to leave. There was no other way
       than for them to withdraw. In his view then, if the Middle East problem was to be solved by
       the United States and the Soviet Union, the very first decision had to be the withdrawal of
       troops to the original armistice line. He did not want to repeat the conversation between
       Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Dr. Fawzi except to say that Dr.
       Fawzi had informed Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> that if the
       International Court of Justice would reach a decision that the Gulf of Aqaba was to remain
       open, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would abide by that decision. This was said to
       Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> by Dr. Fawzi on direct instructions from <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. The President must <pb n="524" xml:id="pg_524" facs="0552"/>realize the
       difficult situation in which <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> found himself
       today. There are many positions that he could not publicly advocate but which he was willing
       to agree to in private and in confidence. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
       asked the President to treat this communication in a most confidential manner because he felt
       that it provided hope for a solution of the Middle East problem. If the problem were not
       solved, another war would be sure to break out sooner or later, completely destroying the
       Suez Canal in addition to other quite unforeseeable consequences. Whatever the Soviet Union
       or the United States had to do about this, whether we furnish them weapons or not, they would
       be sure to resume the fight sooner or later. If they had weapons, they would use them. If
       they did not have them, they would fight with their bare hands or buy weapons and surely
       someone would be found to sell them these weapons. If nothing else they would fight with
       hunting rifles. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was sure that the more
       than 120 nations represented in the United Nations desired a peaceful settlement and he was
       sure that an overwhelming majority of these nations would vote to support the withdrawal of
       troops proposal. He was concerned, however, since he saw the United States do everything
       possible not to permit a vote leading to troop withdrawal. Was this a humane or realistic
       position for the United States to adopt? In summing up, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> wanted to propose that (1) Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> inform the President about his conversation with Dr. Fawzi, (2) that all
       troops be returned to original armistice lines, and (3) that after this had been
       accomplished, all other problems could be discussed. This might take a few months, but it
        would<note n="4" xml:id="d229fn4">Written in hand above “would” is
        “could?”; in the State Department copy at the National Archives,
        “would” is crossed out and “could” written in
        hand above it.</note> be done. Otherwise, whether we wanted this or not, another war was
       sure to break out. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> recited his proposal
       once again, this time placing greater emphasis on further attempts to be made to discuss all
       other outstanding problems in the Middle East area after the withdrawal of troops. He asked
       the President to understand <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. Everything was in
       a state of uproar in the Middle East. If the President had been there, he would know that
       Arabs were an explosive group of people. At present, it was necessary to support <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> because otherwise the situation would be worse. Soviet
       President <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName> was in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> at present and in greatest confidence Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> informed the President that just two days ago he had asked President
        <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName> to talk to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and to ask <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to have his
       position explained directly to the United States. The <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>-Fawzi discussion was a result of this action. The Soviet Union had no
       desire to injure Israel. It is for this reason that he was careful in his speech before the
        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to make this point clear. But was it likely, indeed was it
       realistic to assume that since the Arabs <pb n="525" xml:id="pg_525" facs="0553"/>had not
       talked to Israel before the start of hostilities that they would do so now, before the troops
       were withdrawn? It was extremely difficult, if not impossible, now for the Arab leaders to
       undertake anything in this direction. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
       emphasized that he was telling this to President Johnson in great confidence, that this was
       certainly not intended for any press statements.</p>
                        <p>The President said he hoped that we could prevail on both sides there to first agree that
       they would talk to each other. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> surely knew
       that when he asked for troop withdrawal, questions of security in the area were automatically
       being raised. The Israelis felt that they had been asked to do this very same thing in the
       past without gaining any security. Therefore, along with the troop withdrawal someone had to
       provide that security for them. The President would be glad to explore this question either
       in the UN or directly with the countries concerned, i.e., specifically how to preserve the
       territorial integrity of all states involved and how to provide for their security at one and
       the same time. The President hoped that we could avoid another war involving the use of arms,
       for we have seen in the last few days what vast destruction and human misery such wars lead
       to. If we refrain from furnishing arms to Middle Eastern countries, at most they could fight
       with their hands, which certainly would not be as bad as an armed conflict.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> replied that the Middle Eastern
       countries would find someone to sell them weapons no matter what the great powers would
       do.</p>
                        <p>Meeting adjourned for lunch.</p>

        State College, Glassboro, New Jersey.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The talks were not denunciatory or argumentative. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was reserved, contained, but jolly.</p>
                        <pb n="526" xml:id="pg_526" facs="0554"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> pointed out that he had an 18-year old
       grandson and granddaughter and was the senior grandfather present. They both had a duty to
       protect them by maintaining peace between their countries of 200 million.</p>
                        <p>The President said they had a responsibility not only to the 200 million but to the whole
       world of 3 billion. He hoped their grandsons would grow up to know each other. They had lived
       through the horrors of two wars and they did not wish their grandchildren to share that kind
       of experience.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that during the Second World War he had
       responsibility in Leningrad. He would never forget American help at that time. He said he
       wanted peace, but you don't. The President said, I believe you are sincere but I
       am also. At which <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> appeared a bit chagrined at
       his first ploy.</p>
                        <p>The President explained that in the 3 years he had been in office, we had made no new
       treaties. He had wished to make progress in relations with the Soviet Union. He began with a
       letter to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> urging that they both cut back
       their nuclear production, and they did. He urged they both cut back their levels of defense
       expenditure, and they did. Things then changed. There were hard words about Viet Nam.</p>
                        <p>In these 3 years, despite their stopping Mary Martin's going to Moscow, they had
       concluded the cultural agreement and civil [air] agreement, Consular Agreement. Working hard
       on non-proliferation, ready next week to start discussions on <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>'s and <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s. He was
       awaiting answer which had been delayed 3 months. (President made this point three times and
       never got a reply.)</p>
                        <p>The President said that on the Middle East he had presented his 5 points but got no comment
       from <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that the President before the war had talked about territorial
       integrity, asserted this on hot line, but wound up protecting aggression. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that he had been Stalin's deputy for 12
       years. He had served in Leningrad. He would never forget the time when arm in arm we resisted
       Fascism. He wished we could agree on some of these moves now. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> then said we must bring back the troops to the original armistice lines,
       and put the question of Aqaba into International Court of Justice. Then we could discuss
       other problems. Then came the nearest thing to a threat. He said, unless you do this there
       will be a war, a very great war. I'm against it. They will fight with arms if they
       have them; if not, with fists. All troops must be withdrawn at once. They will fight with
       their bare hands, if necessary. (The President said it was not clear in this passage whether
       the Soviets would supply the arms for this blow up or engage themselves.) The President then
       leaned forward and said very slowly and quietly, let us understand one another. I hope there
       will be no war. If there is a war, I hope it will not be a big war. If they fight, I hope <pb n="527" xml:id="pg_527" facs="0555"/>they fight with fists and not with guns. I hope you and
       we will keep out of this matter because, if we do get into it, it will be a “most
       serious” matter. The President's judgment was that this was not an
       ultimatum and he backed away from the implication that the Soviet Union might itself become
       involved.</p>
                        <p>On the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, the President asked <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> to set a date and let us table the agreement.</p>
                        <p>On <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>'s and <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s, he said let us go to work. Sec. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> can go to Moscow. We can meet in Washington or some neutral point.</p>
                        <p>On Viet Nam, the President drew a map and urged the separation of North Viet Nam from South
       Viet Nam. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> attacked corruption of the regime in
       Saigon. The President did not engage in the quality of our allies.</p>
                        <p>President said some think we should invade North Viet Nam-not Sec <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, but some do urge that. We think bombing of North
       Viet Nam is better than invading it. If you could get them to stop invading the South, you
       could say to us don't invade North Viet Nam. But they must get their people out of
       South Viet Nam. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> or
       anyone could have free elections. They could have any kind of government they want.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said Sec. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> couldn't wait three days in February before he started
       bombing the North. The President said, well you didn't have any influence in
       Hanoi. The Chinese had taken over. You couldn't deliver them.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that Fawzi had given Sec. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> important proposals. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> complained about Amb. <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>'s position at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The President pressed him on sending arms to the Middle East. Said he hoped we both could
       avoid doing that. By working the hot line, they had achieved a cease-fire. The U.S. knew
       nothing of the attack. Had no knowledge of the Israeli attack. They thought they had
       commitments from both parties. He said he assumed the Soviet Union did not know of the
       closure of the Gulf of Aqaba before it took place.</p>
                        <p>The President repeated he hoped both of us would stay outside the area with our armed
       forces. If we engaged, it would be quite serious.</p>
                        <p>At one point <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> complained about our bombing
       Hanoi when he was there. The President explained that our bombing had nothing to do with his
       presence. Sec. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> was bombed when at Saigon. This was
       a problem of travelers going into war areas. In fact, we made clear in our Tonkin resolution
       we would not take such attacks. When they killed 60 of our men asleep at Pleiku, we had to
       take action. Totally unrelated to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s
       visit.</p>
                        <p>President pressed on Middle East, Viet Nam, non-proliferation, <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>'s.</p>
                        <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0556"/>
                        <p>He got no positive reaction in the first talks. But he found <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> friendly, jolly and warm. He enjoyed him.</p>
                        <p>There was some exchange on the two Ambassadors. President said he thought very well of Amb.
        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and Tommy Thompson had his full confidence.
       He had returned to Moscow as duty to all humanity as well as to his country.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> reports very objectively. He says nothing that will increase the heat
       between the two countries.</p>

                        <p>During the lunch, the President and Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
       exchanged a number of views in repetition of some of those discussed during the morning
       meeting. At one point, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> stated that all
       governmental and international bodies had a tendency of becoming bureaucracy managed and
       controlled. He saw a great danger in this trend which had brought about the demise of the
       League of Nations and said that in his view a meeting of heads of states or governments at
       the United Nations every year or two years would be helpful in preventing this trend from
       getting the upper hand. He felt that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would then truly
       provide a forum for an exchange of views between governments as against the present situation
       of a bureaucracy and red tape hindering the useful work of the organization.</p>
                        <p>At the President's request, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> discussed with Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
       some aspects of arms control. He stated his position regarding the desirability of avoiding
       an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> race between the two countries by pointing out that
       the two countries had engaged in an arms race in nuclear weapons which had already gone
       beyond all reason. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> agreed with this view.
       The Secretary enlarged upon the process of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> reacting to
       developments in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and vice versa, and said that he
       considered this to be an insane road to follow. At some point, we should begin to dampen the
       expansion of nuclear arms-both offensive and defensive. He emphasized that he did not mean
       this statement to imply that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> or the Soviet Union should
       disarm. He considered complete disarmament to be beyond achievement at the present stage of
       world affairs. He did think, however, that both countries should put a limit on their
       development of offensive and defensive weapons.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that he did not quite agree with
       this view of preventing a race in <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems development. He
       said: supposing we were to agree that no <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems were to
       be developed at all, but that it would be perfectly all right to continue to develop
       offensive weapons; what could mankind possibly hope to gain from this type of approach? He
       knew that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> was not a military man,
       even though he was engaged in dealing with military matters, but he saw no logic in his
       arguments. Further, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that he had read
       a speech delivered by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> in which the
       Secretary had stated that it was much cheaper to develop offensive weapons than defensive
       ones. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> considered this type of approach to
       be actually immoral. He regarded this as a commercial approach to a moral problem which was
       by its very nature invalid. He would agree with the Secretary if the Secretary would agree to
       consider the entire complex of the arms race in offensive and defensive weapons.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated that he knew he had not
       made his thoughts clear to many people in this country and from Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s remarks he concluded that his views were
       not clear to the <pb n="530" xml:id="pg_530" facs="0558"/>Chairman as well. He did not
       suggest control or limitations on defensive weapons only, but on both. He supposed that the
       subject required more time than was available today and suggested that it could be further
       explored through Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, but he did want to stress 2 or 3 points: (1) he did
       not suggest that the discussion be limited to defensive weapons; (2) he did not believe that
       we should limit defensive weapons and continue expanding offensive ones; (3) the whole matter
       was not a question of offensive weapons being cheaper than defensive ones; he was not taking
       a commercial view of the problem as the Chairman had suggested. He did not think that in the
       present situation the security of our respective peoples would permit us to disarm in the
       near future. But he did consider the continued growth of offensive weapons to represent a
       great danger to each of our countries and a great penalty to our respective societies.
       Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> developed the thought that the
       development of offensive weapons led to increased development of defensive measures against
       them, which in turn promoted further development of offensive weapons, etc., beyond all
       reason. Such a situation was not in the interest of the security of either country and he
       felt very strongly and hoped that this process could be stopped by discussing the entire
       range of problems either in Moscow or in Washington or in both places.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that he had read the
       Secretary's speech which had led him to the conclusion that a commercial approach
       had been taken. He did not think he was wrong in this and indeed the Secretary confirmed that
       he had made such a speech, although he was convinced the Chairman had misunderstood his
       meaning. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was glad to see that he was
       right. He did not want to say anything that was wrong for the simple reason that he was the
       Prime Minister of the Soviet Union. He continued that he then interpreted the
       Secretary's statement in the manner in which he had described it earlier, namely,
       that the Secretary advocated a limitation on the development of defensive weapons while
       continuing the development of offensive weapons. He failed to see how the question could be
       posed in such a bare-faced manner. After he had read the Secretary's statement, he
       very much wanted to have a chance to meet him and tell him just that, so that his words might
       perhaps force the Secretary to realize the fallacy of his concept. He considered it to be his
       duty to say this to the Secretary and he was very happy to have the opportunity of doing just
       this. On the other hand, he did see a positive aspect in what the Secretary had just said in
       the sense that the Secretary appeared to be urgently concerned for the fate of mankind, and
       this he considered to be a hopeful development.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> replied to the Chairman that
       while he knew it to be true that offensive weapons were cheaper than defensive ones, as is
       true of many facts, this particular one was quite irrelevant. Some <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531" facs="0559"/>people in our country thought that the Secretary was in favor
       of disarming at the expense of the security of our nation. This view was quite as wrong as
       the one expressed by the Chairman. He did think, however, that each country could take some
       steps toward limitation of arms without endangering its respective security.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> remarked that he thought a part
       of the misunderstanding arose because of the great pressure in this country to further
       develop armaments as a result of increasing ABM development in the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>At this point, the President and Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
       exchanged toasts, texts of which are attached hereto.<note n="2" xml:id="d231fn2">Not

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> informed the President in strictest
       confidence as follows: In anticipation of a meeting with President Johnson he had two days
       ago contacted Hanoi in the person of Pham Van Dong as to what he could do during his meeting
       with the President to help bring this war to an end. Just now, while he was having lunch with
       the President, a reply from Hanoi had been received. In substance, it amounted <pb n="532" xml:id="pg_532" facs="0560"/>to the following: Stop the bombing and they would immediately
       go to the conference table. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> did not know
       what the President's views of this proposal would be, but he wanted to express his
       own opinion very strongly, to the effect that he thought the President should follow-up this
       proposal. It provided for the first time the opportunity of talking directly with Hanoi at no
       risk for the United States. He asked the President to recall the experience of President de
       Gaulle of France who had fought in Algiers for seven years and still wound up at the
       conference table. He was sure of the North Vietnamese will to continue to fight for many
       years if necessary. And what would the President accomplish? He would carry on a war for ten
       years or more, killing off the best of the young people of his nation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> knew that American soldiers fought well, that they knew
       how to fight, and that they fought willingly since they believed that they were fighting for
       their country. The young people of the Soviet Union in similar circumstances would also fight
       just as well. In his view, it was now time to end the war and to sit down at the conference
       table and then the President could see what would develop. This could be the very greatest
       problem which the two of them could resolve here together today: to end this obnoxious war
       and to let the rest of the world breathe easier because the danger of it spilling over into a
       bigger war had been removed. He repeated once again that this message was intended for the
       President only; that this was not to be made public in any way.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that first of all he agreed to the limitation on disseminating the
       information provided. Secondly, however, he asked what would happen if we went to the
       conference table this very minute; would this mean that fighting would continue as it had
       during the Korean armistice negotiations?</p>
                        <p>Chairman Kosygin replied that he would not guarantee that the war would end, neither could
       he guarantee however that it would escalate. With great emphasis he made the point that while
       the President thought he was fighting the Chinese in North Korea, Mr. Kosygin had to tell him
       that he was actually helping the Chinese in achieving their very worst designs.</p>
                        <p>The President said that China represented the very greatest danger to both countries at
       present, and that he certainly did not want to do anything that would promote Chinese
       policy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> asked the President to bear in mind that
       this meeting between them was of an emergency nature, that time was short and that if time
       were available they would be able to explore the most delicate problems at greater length.
       While he considered North Viet-Nam's proposal to be the President's own
       business, he emphatically believed that now the President had ample reason to sit down and
       negotiate with North Viet-Nam. He had not wanted to take any responsibility <pb n="533" xml:id="pg_533" facs="0561"/>upon himself in speaking on behalf of North Viet-Nam and it is
       for this reason that he had asked for a statement of their position and had received this
       reply just an hour ago. If the President could see his way clear to follow the proposal, this
       would be an immense step forward in the right direction. Sooner or later American forces
       would have to be withdrawn from Viet-Nam and it was better sooner than later. Could the
       President imagine what great sighs of relief would be heard throughout the world if such a
       truly historic decision were taken by him now. At several different times in the past, the
       President had sought an intermediary between the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and North
       Viet-Nam and had even considered using the offices of some second rate countries, which
       carried no weight in the world, but here and now there was an opportunity to engage in direct
       negotiations with Hanoi and he earnestly urged the President to weigh this possibility. Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> would still be in New York on Saturday and
       Sunday and would be glad to transmit any reply the President had to make.</p>
                        <p>To the President's question of when the Chairman expected to leave the United
       States, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> replied that he was leaving on
       Monday and added, again in confidence, that he would visit Cuba on the way home.</p>
                        <p>The President asked for additional clarification on the following points: He was informed
       to the effect that North Viet-Nam had five divisions deployed immediately north of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>. It was the best advice of our military people that if the
       bombing stopped, these five divisions would be brought to bear upon our Marines immediately
       south of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, resulting in a great many casualties among
       our boys. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> surely realized that should this
       happen following the President's decision to stop the bombing, he would be
       crucified in this country for having taken the decision.</p>
                        <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> thought that from a practical point
       of view the question could be put as follows: If the bombing stopped today, representatives
       of the United States and North Viet-Nam would meet tomorrow, wherever the President
       wished—Hanoi or New York or Moscow or Paris or Geneva or any other place. From
       that point on, it would be up to the negotiators to work out what was to follow. In
       establishing such direct contact with Hanoi, the President could present all questions
       between the United States and North Viet-Nam and the other side could do the same. Certainly,
       this could save hundreds of thousands of lives which would otherwise perish in vain. The
       President could set the condition that if the bombing were stopped, representatives of the
       two countries should meet at any place designated in, say, two days. Without such direct
       contact, no solution was possible. The President did not know what they wanted and indeed
       North Viet-Nam did not know what the President wanted. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> urged the <pb n="534" xml:id="pg_534" facs="0562"/>President to try this
       step, which in addition carried no risk to the position of the United States. He urged the
       President to weigh this proposal, he did not then ask for a reply today, he asked the
       President to think it over.</p>
                        <p>The President asked the Chairman whether he would and could provide assistance at the
       conference table, if such a meeting took place, in obtaining self-determination for the
       people of South Viet-Nam?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> replied that he could not decide this
       question independently without advice from North Viet-Nam. But, if by tomorrow night the
       President could inform him of his views and conditions on this question, he would immediately
       transmit them to Hanoi for a reply.</p>
                        <p>The President again asked the Chairman whether, assuming that we got to the conference
       table, the Soviet Union would and could help us obtain an agreement providing
       self-determination for the people of South Viet-Nam which would ultimately enable us to
       withdraw our forces. The President had formerly informed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that if such an agreement could be obtained, we would be prepared to
       withdraw our troops regardless of former investment in the area. He would interpret free
       elections in South Viet-Nam under the supervision of the co-chairmen as fulfilling the
       conditions of such an agreement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> replied with a suggestion that the
       question the President had asked him be formulated on paper without reference to Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> or the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
       that it be addressed to North Viet-Nam, and be given to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> for immediate transmission to Hanoi. Such a statement should preferably
       be brief and clear and he, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, would consider
       this to be an important step forward.</p>
                        <p>The President asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> when and where he
       could meet with him if he would give favorable consideration to addressing such a question to
       North Viet-Nam? He suggested another meeting with the Chairman on Sunday afternoon at the
       same place, in other words, at the Glassboro State College.</p>
                        <p>The President also wanted to explore a number of other questions with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. He honestly believed that the Chairman had
       misunderstood Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and very much wanted
       to correct this misunderstanding because it was Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> who exercised a restraining influence on the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems development. The President also wanted Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> to understand very clearly that when we proposed
       discussions on <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems, we of course had in mind not only
       defensive but also offensive weapons.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> replied that he was still shocked by
       Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s speech in which he
       had referred to offensive weapons being cheaper than defensive ones. The President urged Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> to further <pb n="535" xml:id="pg_535" facs="0563"/>explore Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s
       views. He felt he had profited by talking to the Chairman face to face and thought that
       either the Chairman or his representatives could carry on a dialogue with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and they would profit by it also. The President again
       urged that the non-proliferation treaty be tabled if necessary even without Article III,
       leaving that question to be agreed upon later.</p>
                        <p>To this Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> replied that he could not see
       why this insignificant problem of who was to exercise control should play such an important
       part. Inasmuch as an international agency existed of which both countries were members, the
        <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>, why then did we insist on inspection by <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> rather than by that agency? Why could not the President
       and he agree to resolve this question in order to have a workable draft to present to the
       other countries?</p>
                        <p>The President suggested this be worked out between Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> this weekend. As for
       Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, he was willing to meet with the
       Chairman's representatives in Moscow, Paris or Geneva at any time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> replied that he would consult with
       Moscow and give the President his answer on this subject. He stressed again that all problems
       between the two nations could be solved if it were not for the grave problem in Viet-Nam and
       the new problems which have arisen in the Middle East. He felt very strongly that Viet-Nam
       had destroyed much that had developed between the United States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and had given China a chance to raise its head with
       consequent great danger for the peace of the entire world. Viet-Nam also led the United
       States into something unknown and had finally resulted in a military budget today which was
       greater than that of 1943. He asked if this could be considered to be a sober and reasonable
       policy. If it came to a question of prestige, he wanted to remind the President of the
       example of de Gaulle who had fought in Algiers for 7 years and then had withdrawn; in
       consequence, his prestige had not decreased at all, on the contrary it had risen throughout
       the world. In one of the telegrams transmitted over the Hot Line, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had written the President that there were forces in the
       world which were interested in causing a clash between the United States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. He assured the President that such forces did indeed
       exist.</p>
                        <p>The President and Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> considered a
       joint statement to the press which the President read to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and asked him if he had any changes or additions to suggest. Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> concurred in the statement completely,
       considered it to be an accurate and correct reflection of the talks held at this meeting. It
       was agreed that the President would read the statement to the press and that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> would add his concurrence in the statement immediately
       following the President's <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536" facs="0564"/>address. The
       meeting was adjourned until Sunday, June 25, 1967, at 1:30 p.m., to be held at the same
       location.</p>

                        <p>The enclosed is our suggestion of a paragraph which you could give as an oral message
       tomorrow. For the convenience of the Chairman, you could actually give him a copy. But since
       his message to you was oral, it might be better that the enclosed be oral, at least in
       form.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the enclosed, we believe you should say the following to the Chairman:</p>
                        <p>“Mr. Chairman, you and I have a very special responsibility on matters involving
       peace. It is of the greatest importance that you and I not misunderstand each other and that
       no problems of good faith arise between us. Therefore, I want you personally to know that we
       are prepared to stop the bombing as a step toward peace. We are not prepared to stop the
       bombing merely to remove one-half of the war while the other half of the war proceeds without
       limit. I am accepting very large risks in giving you the message for transmittal to Hanoi
       which I have just given you. I want you to know that if talks do not lead to peace or if
       protracted talks are used to achieve one-sided military advantage against us, we shall have
       to resume full freedom of action. I say this to you and not to Hanoi because I think it is of
       great importance that you and I fully understand each other. I do not ask you to agree; I am
       merely asking you to understand what is in my mind.”</p>

                        <p>Oral Message From President Johnson to Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>Washington, undated.</p>
                        <p>The United States anticipates that it could stop the bombing of the Democratic Republic of
       Viet-Nam. The United States further anticipates that, following the cessation of bombing,
       there could be immediate discussions between representatives of the United States and of the
       Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam. These discussions could be held in Geneva, Moscow,
       Vientiane, or any other suitable location. The United States further anticipates that its own
       and allied forces in the northern provinces of South Viet-Nam would not advance to the north
       and that elements of the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam in the northern
       part of South Viet-Nam and in the southern portions of North Viet-Nam would not advance to
       the south. The United States anticipates that, if discussions are held between its
       representatives and those of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam, all questions which either
       side might wish to raise could be raised. The United States would hope, on the basis of the
       anticipations expressed above, that the results of such talks could be the stabilization of
       peace in Southeast Asia. The United States would be glad to know of the reactions of the
       Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam to the thoughts expressed above.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Following an exchange of pleasantries between the President and Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, a brief description of each other's workday
       and the President's thanks to the Chairman on behalf of himself and Mrs. Johnson
       for the presents given him at the previous meeting, the President inquired how Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had enjoyed his visit to Niagara Falls.<note n="2" xml:id="d234fn2">Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, his daughter, and
        about 50 other Soviets visited Niagara Falls on June 24, traveling there in a Presidential
        aircraft. Chief of Protocol James W. Symington, who accompanied <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, reported on the visit in a June 27 memorandum to President Johnson.
        (Ibid., Memos to the President—<persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt
        Rostow</persName>, Vol. 32)</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said
       that he had enjoyed it very much indeed, particularly his inspection of the power station,
       which was of great interest to him from an engineering point of view. He said that the Soviet
       Union today had the largest power station in the world and that next year an even larger
       hydro-electric power station would be started up. Thus when he said he liked the power
       station at Niagara he was speaking as an expert. President Johnson briefly mentioned the six
       small water projects on his native river in Texas and to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s question as to whether irrigation was used in that part of
       the country he replied that it was and also, in connection with the meal served at the
       luncheon, mentioned that he raised sheep.</p>
                        <p>President Johnson told the Chairman that he had made an excellent impression on the
       American people, that everyone here was hopeful that peaceful relations with the Soviet Union
       could be maintained and extended and that the leaders of the two countries would find ways
       and means to bring this about. He said that the press reaction to Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s visit here was very favorable and that, in
       spite of some such feelings in the past as had been stimulated by the Dies Committee, on the
       whole, the great wish of the people of this country was that Americans and Russians would
       find a way to like each other rather <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0567"/>than hate each
       other and to this end the Chairman's visit had contributed significantly.</p>
                        <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> replied that while it was true that
       the people here seemed to be very friendly and pleasant, he was somewhat perplexed by some
       excerpts from the President's address in Los Angeles which had been shown to him
       to the effect that while a socialist and a capitalist system existed in this world, tensions
       would remain.<note n="3" xml:id="d234fn3">For text of the President's remarks at
        the President's Club dinner on the evening of June 23, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon
          B. Johnson</persName>, 1967,</hi> Book I, pp. 645–650.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The President replied that he must have been misquoted or else quoted completely out of
       context, since in his speech he had spoken of a new spirit of friendship between the two
       countries and of his earnest hope that mutually acceptable solutions to outstanding problems
       would be found. He had said in that speech that one meeting does not in itself resolve all
       problems, that their solution required extended talks and negotiations and that that was what
       he was now trying to accomplish.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> volunteered the information that he was
       leaving at noon on Monday, June 26, 1967, and in reply to the President's question
       said that he did not presently intend to stop anywhere else other than Cuba, where he hoped
       to spend no more than two days. He was anxious to return to Moscow since he had to present a
       three-year budget plan; this was not an easy job because of the conflicting demands for
       resources made by various agencies and organizations of the Soviet Union for construction and
       development purposes. He said that he was under great pressure to devote more of the
       resources of his country to these peaceful pursuits, that many people came to him with
       requests for more money and that he was hard put to explain why not all these requests could
       be granted. He had the feeling that even after his explanations these people went away
       believing that they had not been properly understood.</p>
                        <p>In this connection the President expressed the hope that the two countries would be able to
       reduce their military budgets in order to devote more of their resources to peaceful
       pursuits. He pointed out that during the three years he had been President his Administration
       had tripled expenditures for education from $4 billion annually to $12 billion, that it had
       also tripled expenditures for health in the same amount, that is, from $4 billion to $12
       billion annually and that this total increase in expenditures from $8 billion for health and
       education when he first became President to $24 billion now indicated the direction in which
       he wanted this country to develop. It is for this reason that he was most anxious to have a
       chance to explore all possibilities <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540" facs="0568"/>for cutting down
       the military budget if the Soviet Union could be persuaded to do the same. We were ready to
       discuss all aspects of this question, we had asked for such talks three months ago through
       Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> and yet nothing further had been
       heard since the Soviet Government had indicated that it was willing to discuss these matters.
       When and where could Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> meet with
       representatives of the Soviet Union to begin meaningful discussions?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that he and his Government were
       indeed interested in finding some means of reducing military expenditures, but that this very
       much depended upon relations with the United States. How could the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> reduce its military expenditures while it was spending upwards of $20 billion on
       the Viet-Nam war alone? It seemed to him that while this war continued a discussion of budget
       reduction could not be more than academic.</p>
                        <p>With reference to Viet-Nam, the President pointed out that military expenditure reduction
       could be achieved if the Soviet Union reduced or eliminated its supply of military equipment
       to North Viet-Nam while we found a way to de-escalate the struggle in South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>He said that at the very least an increase in the military budgets could be prevented if
       agreement was reached with the Soviet Union on the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
       problem. He had held back on authorizing full development of <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems in order to provide the opportunity for full exploration of this
       question with the Soviet Union. President Johnson repeated: when and where could Secretary
        <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> meet with Soviet representatives?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that our proposals appeared to
       extend to a discussion of defensive systems only and that he could not agree with such an
       approach. President Johnson retorted that, as he had stressed during their previous talk, we
       definitely meant exploring all possibilities of reducing expenditures for offensive as well
       as defensive systems.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that if the President really wanted
       to discuss disarmament measures he was prepared to come here from Moscow with a delegation of
       his experts for that purpose. But he still failed to see true possibilities while the
       Viet-Nam war continues and while the Middle East situation remains unsettled. He turned to a
       repetition of his position regarding the Middle East. He pointed out that on the one hand
       there were 100 million Arabs who were really people of the 19th century as far as their
       spiritual development was concerned, and on the other hand here were 3 million Jews who were
       20th century people, had attacked the Arabs and seized large tracts of Arab territory. There
       could be no peaceful settlement in the Middle East unless these forces were withdrawn.</p>
                        <pb n="541" xml:id="pg_541" facs="0569"/>
                        <p>The President replied that one could not regard this question as merely a matter of numbers
       of people involved, it was also a question of what was right. The President had been careful
       to note in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s speech before the
        <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> that he had acknowledged Israel's right to
       a national life.<note n="4" xml:id="d234fn4">For text of the June 19 speech, see <hi rend="italic">The New York Times,</hi> pp. 16–17.</note> He asked the Chairman whether he
       had read the President's speech on the Middle East situation which had been
       delivered before the Chairman's address.<note n="5" xml:id="d234fn5">For text of
        the President's address at the State Department's Foreign Policy
        Conference for Educators on June 19, <hi rend="italic">see Public Papers of the Presidents
         of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>, 1967,</hi>
        Book I, pp. 630–635.</note> Following Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s reply to the effect that he had watched the
       President's speech on television and had had it translated for him, the President
       asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> point by point whether he did not
       agree with the proposals the President had made in that speech. One such proposal pertains to
       the recognition of Israel's right to a national existence. A second proposal
       pertains to the right of free passage through international waterways such as the Strait of
       Tiran and the Suez Canal; since the Soviet Union was also a maritime power, surely the
       Chairman too was for such right of free passage. He certainly thought the Chairman would
       agree that something had to be done for the refugees of this and the previous wars.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that in his view, following troop
       withdrawal to the original armistice line, all other questions could be solved. He pointed
       out that surely if the United States had been invaded the President would not agree to any
       discussion of settlement as long as parts of the United States were under foreign control.
       For his part he could definitely state that the Soviet Union under such hypothetical
       circumstances certainly could not agree to hold discussions while parts of its territory were
       occupied by an aggressor. He related this position to the previous discussion of reduction of
       the military budget and said that, after all, it was not the Soviet Union which had gone to
       war but rather the United States in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>The President pointed out that we had not gone to war over Cuba although the Soviet Union
       had placed offensive missiles on that island. To this the Chairman replied that the Soviet
       Union had not gone to war either, that it had withdrawn its missiles from Cuba. In fact he
       said that we had been instrumental in pressuring <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to withdraw the missiles and surely the President knew that there
       were no missiles on Cuba today.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> presently was in a very difficult position, that what was needed was an
       effort to find a way out for Nasser, that the question of closing the Straits could be solved
       if troops were <pb n="542" xml:id="pg_542" facs="0570"/>withdrawn to start with. A way to
       accomplish this would be to state that following troop withdrawal all other questions would
       be considered.</p>
                        <p>President Johnson did not think that it was possible now to just remove the troops without
       at the same time removing the dangers which had caused the conflict in the first place. We
       had to find a way to get the two sides to talk to and listen to each other. We did not say
       that all of our friends were perfect and he was sure the Chairman would not make such
       statements about his friends either. The President knew that it had not been the Soviet
       Union's advice that caused <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to close
       the Gulf of Aqaba, and that evidently the Soviet Union's advice to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had not been heeded. This same situation pertained to
       some of our friends too. This was a case where neither our friends nor the
       Chairman's friends took our respective advice. He was sure that the Chairman did
       not think the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had encouraged Israel to send its Air Force
       into action. He considered the Chairman to be far too intelligent to think that.</p>
                        <p>President Johnson repeated that it was not enough to say: “remove the
       troops,” that along with troop removal the dangers facing Israel would have to be
       removed as well. The President pointed out that short of some such arrangement the Israelis
       would certainly not follow our advice. They had not followed our advice with respect to
       refraining from sending their Air Force into action just as Nasser had not followed the
       Soviet Union's advice which the President was confident must have been to refrain
       from closing the Gulf of Aqaba. Alarming reports of new arms shipments being carried by
       hundreds of planes and ships to the Arab countries since the ceasefire, and continuing danger
       of renewed hostilities had already resulted in our being asked to supply new weapons. So far
       we had refused in the hope of getting the Soviet Union's agreement to full
       disclosure of arms shipments, in spite of various pressures upon us. Therefore, the solution
       of the Middle East difficulties had to be found in something that would be acceptable to both
       sides. How else could we make our friends listen?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> stated emphatically that he was certain
       war would break out again unless the Israeli troops were withdrawn quickly. Therefore, he
       suggested that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council pass a resolution
       forcing Israel to withdraw and include a provision for negotiations to begin following
       withdrawal. He was convinced that this was the only way to prevent a new war in that area. He
       pointed to the experience in Algiers where the Arabs had fought for seven years until France
       finally decided to withdraw. He was sure the President knew that the Straits would have been
       opened had hostilities not been initiated by Israel.</p>
                        <p>To this the President replied that both countries should have taken immediate steps to open
       the Straits after <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had closed them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said there was little point now in a
       historical review <pb n="543" xml:id="pg_543" facs="0571"/>of that situation. The problem was
       here and now and the only solution was troop withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>President Johnson repeated again that such a resolution would not be heeded by Israel.
       Before the outbreak of hostilities he had talked for one hour with Israel's
       Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> and thought after that talk that
       Israel would await the Security Council's action before doing anything drastic.
       However, after all <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had seized the Straits, he
       had closed the Gulf, he had threatened to liquidate Israel and had concluded a military
       agreement for that purpose with Syria. This must have scared the Israelis to death, prompting
       them to send their armed forces into action. Neither one of us had been able to prevail upon
       our friends, and the President knew today that the resolution proposed by the Chairman would
       not be followed. Apparently Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> had
       met with disagreement within his own government, which was split almost evenly on the issue
       of what effective steps to take. For this reason what was needed now was not a determination
       of what was right depending upon the numbers of people involved on each side but rather by
       what could be done to remove the fears along with removing the troops. He was certain that
       the five points he had proposed would accomplish exactly that.</p>

                        <p>After lunch, the President continued his conversation alone with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
       suggested that the various questions be discussed in a more specific way.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed and expressed the view that the controlling question was that of the
       armaments race. The arms problem was of extreme importance to us, and we would like to
       discuss such questions as offensive and defensive missiles systems, arms expenditures in
       general, military budgets, and arms disclosure, i.e., arms sales to other countries. The two
       sides should have meetings in order to discuss how they both could reduce their arms budgets
       and also to discuss all other relevant questions. If he had understood the Chairman correctly
       as saying that he was willing to have his representatives meet with our people on these
       questions, he should give the time and the place and they could meet. Perhaps there would be
       results, perhaps not, but in any event it would be very desirable to have even short talks so
       that both sides would understand each other's positions, for he did not believe
       that the Soviet side really understood Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s position.</p>
                        <pb n="545" xml:id="pg_545" facs="0573"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> noted that the President had raised the
       arms question first. He said that in his view the situation in the Middle East and the war in
       Viet-Nam should be discussed first inasmuch as both of these questions, and particularly the
       war in Viet-Nam, had a direct bearing on the arms question. He did not think the United
       States could reduce its armaments while the war in Viet-Nam was going on; after all, the
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was spending something like $20 billion on the war in
       Viet-Nam. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, in turn, was also spending enormous sums
       of money in connection with that situation. Consequently, it would not be possible to reduce
       military budgets for armaments while the Viet-Nam war continued, or while the situation in
       the Middle East remained unresolved. In view of this, he felt that the Middle Eastern
       situation should be discussed first. Both sides could state their specific positions on the
       subject, then turn to Viet-Nam, and then to non-proliferation and other disarmament
       questions. Perhaps some bilateral problems could be discussed as well, but apparently neither
       side had anything specific in this area at this time.</p>
                        <p>The President said he had no particular preference as to the order of discussion, noting
       that he would be agreeable to any sequence suggested by the Chairman.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the Middle East crisis, the President said that, as the Chairman had indicated
       in his <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> speech that we should, the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had searched for common language on the problem. We had hoped
       that our five points could serve as a basis for such language, or for at least finding a
       solution. As the Chairman would recall, those points included territorial integrity, freedom
       of innocent maritime passage, refugees, arms, etc. The Chairman had said that this did not
       offer a basis and that therefore he could not agree; if this was so, we would have to search
       for something else, but we had hoped that both sides could agree on these points. The
       Chairman had said at <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> that an attempt should be made to
       find common language, and we had agreed to do so. In this connection, the President observed
       that the General Assembly's function was to make recommendations rather than take
       action; the General Assembly could make recommendations to the Security Council and to the
       participants in the conflict. We had studied Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s speech at the General Assembly very carefully and believed
       that we ought to be able to find common language. There were a number of points on which the
       two sides should be able to agree. Such points were withdrawal of forces, Israel's
       existence as a state, elimination of the state of belligerency, reaffirmation of the non-use
       of force, freedom of maritime passage through the Straits and in the Gulf of Aqaba,
       intensified social and economic development for the area, reduction of the arms race, the
       refugee problem, effective presence of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and mediation.
       Some of these points were contained in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s speech, and we believed that none of them was inconsistent
       with <pb n="546" xml:id="pg_546" facs="0574"/>Soviet policy. The President said he expected
       Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> to go to New York in order to discuss
       these points with the Soviet side. He would urge his very able Secretary to be as persuasive
       as possible in New York and to finish his discussions as expeditiously as possible,
       although-as the Chairman has said-it was difficult to persuade some people.<note n="3" xml:id="d235fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> discussed the Middle East with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in New York on June 27. A memorandum of their
        conversation is scheduled for publication in Foreign Relations, 1964–1968, volume
        XIX.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said he had no objection to discussions
       between the Secretary and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>; as to himself,
       he was going to leave tomorrow. He wished to note, however, that all of the points listed by
       the President referred to the Arabs and none of them said what Israel, the party guilty of
       aggression, should do. He had studied the Arab position very carefully while in New York and
       could tell the President that the Arabs would not accept such a proposition. Therefore, he
       believed that the only realistic approach was that proposed by the Soviet Union. As the
       President knew, the three points set forth in the Soviet position were recognition of Israel
       as the perpetrator of aggression, withdrawal of Israeli forces, and compensation.</p>
                        <p>The President interjected that the Chairman perhaps did not understand that withdrawal was
       included in our points as well. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that
       he did understand this but the problem was that the point was listed at the end whereas the
       Soviet Union placed it first.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> went on to say that he believed that at
       this time withdrawal was the main question; if there were to be no withdrawal, there would be
       a new war in the Middle East. He said he agreed that there was no need for a double decision,
       as it were, and thought that <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> should make a
       recommendation on withdrawal, with the Security Council then determining the time-frame and
       other modalities, or-if Israel were to refuse to comply-the necessary sanctions. Also, he
       believed that we must work on the Arabs to open the Straits. As to all other questions raised
       by the President, they were of a long-term nature and could be resolved only through
       prolonged discussions and debates. Thus, the most effective way of approaching the problem
       now was to concentrate on the question of withdrawal. U Thant should be asked to supervise
       compliance with any decision on this question through his representatives in the area. Other
       questions could then be discussed, perhaps in the Security Council. This was the Soviet plan
       and if the President did not agree, it was quite clear that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and the Soviet positions were different.</p>
                        <p>The President reiterated his belief that the positions of the two sides ought to be in
       agreement on such questions as withdrawal, mediation, <pb n="547" xml:id="pg_547" facs="0575"/>UN presence, the arms question, acceptance of Israel's existence, and
       elimination of the state of belligerency. He then said that while he understood the
       Chairman's position, the US could not agree to a resolution which would deal only
       with withdrawal and ignore elements of “common language” that are
       important and imperative for a solution of the problem. He believed that other elements for
       common language could be found and that, therefore, the search for them should be continued.
       He thought that even if the General Assembly were somehow to make a recommendation dealing
       only with withdrawal, such recommendation would bring no results. He reiterated that the two
       sides ought to be able to find common language by exploring the 10 or 11 points they had
       mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> observed that the General Assembly could
       pass such a resolution if the United States supported it; otherwise, a large group of states
       under <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> influence would oppose it. At the same time, he would
       not rule out the possibility of such a resolution being passed even in the absence of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> support, for all the non-aligned countries—some 40 of
       them—would definitely support it. He reiterated that all other questions could be
       taken up and discussed once the question of withdrawal was resolved. As he had said earlier,
       other questions were of a long-term nature and would take a long time to be resolved. For
       instance, the President had mentioned the refugee problem. This was a very complex problem;
       for even if the United States were to offer to some specific number of refugees, let us say
       5,000, resettlement in the United States, those people might not accept such an offer and
       might want to go home. What we should deal with now was the most immediate problem. We were
       now faced with a situation where Suez was closed, no oil was flowing, and another war could
       break out. Suez must not be closed for long, but now it constitutes the front line. In sum,
       the basic problem was withdrawal; once that was accomplished, other questions could be taken
       up.</p>
                        <p>The President said he understood the Chairman as saying that the General Assembly should
       make only one recommendation and ignore all other problems of the area.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> interjected that he did not suggest that
       all other questions should be ignored; they could be discussed in the Security Council later.
       If all the questions raised by the President were to be discussed in the General Assembly,
       the General Assembly might have to last a couple of years, and that, of course, would be an
       unrealistic approach.</p>
                        <p>The President continued that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> could not agree to
       confine the General Assembly's resolution to only one recommendation. We believe
       that the General Assembly should try to find “common language” for
       recommendation to the Security Council and to the parties. Such common language should
       indicate the way of making peace and should <pb n="548" xml:id="pg_548" facs="0576"/>therefore include some of the points he had listed earlier. Thus, in summary, the Chairman
       was saying that only one point should be dealt with while we believed that several points
       should be included. For this reason, the President said, he would instruct the Secretary and
       Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> to continue working very hard; he
       did not believe that one recommendation would do the job or be satisfactory to the Security
       Council or the combatants.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> commented that the situation did not
       look good as there seemed to be no understanding on this problem.</p>
                        <p>The President again reiterated that we should search for common language in the General
       Assembly, citing as possible elements such questions as withdrawal, freedom of maritime
       passage, Israel's right to existence, elimination of the rights of belligerence,
       reduction of the arms race, mediation, and effective <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
       presence. He expressed the view that, as a close look at the Chairman's speech and
       our statement would indicate, all of these points offered some possibility. In any event,
       they would certainly be explored in the Security Council and in the area. It was
       inconceivable to him that the General Assembly would not recommend elements for permanent
       peace, and all of the points he had mentioned were such elements. The Chairman might of
       course be right that the General Assembly would make a recommendation only on one point, but
       such a recommendation would not be likely to solve anything.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that the conflict between India and
       Pakistan could serve as a good example. The situation had been quite similar there and he
       could say that if there had been no mutual withdrawal at that time, war would still be going
       on. The decision made at Tashkent to have the withdrawal had been a very correct one; for
       while the problem still remained unresolved, there was no war any longer.</p>
                        <p>The President interjected that while it was accurate to say that withdrawal had been
       achieved in the India/Pakistani conflict, one should bear in mind that the withdrawal of
       forces had been accompanied by a withdrawal of arms; these two things went together. The
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, while not a participant at Tashkent, had also made this
       decision, and we were greatly appreciative of the good job that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had done at Tashkent. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that this was not a question of what he had done but rather one of
       principle. Withdrawal had stopped the war between India and Pakistan; in the Middle East,
       however, we now have tension and military hostilities could break out any minute. The
       President said we agreed that withdrawal would reduce tensions to a degree but, then, other
       elements would do so even more. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that
       as regards Aqaba, the Security Council could take a decision on that question. The President
       wondered why the two questions should not be decided together. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> replied that in such a large body as the General
       Assembly, a vote on the question of Aqaba would <pb n="549" xml:id="pg_549" facs="0577"/>not
       be successful. The President observed that this was why we had felt all along that the
       problem should be discussed in the Security Council. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that the Soviet view was that withdrawal should be discussed in the
       General Assembly and that other questions should be taken up in the Security Council.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> continued that unless withdrawal was
       accomplished, a long war would occur which, like the one in Algeria, would last several
       years. Responsibility for such a war would fall upon those who made a wrong decision; if the
       United States should make a wrong decision, responsibility would fall upon it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> reiterated that the problem could be resolved only on
       the basis he had outlined. No Arab could even think of accepting any of the other points
       raised by the President. On the other hand, if there were withdrawal, life would go back to
       normal, and he agreed that Aqaba and the Strait of Tiran should be opened. All other
       questions could be taken up subsequently. It would be the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
       that would be responsible if no right decision was taken now. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> wanted all questions to be included, and this was impossible. As he had said
       earlier, a new war would break out with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aiding one side
       and the Soviet Union the other; under those conditions, there could be no question of
       reducing arms or military spending-all this would be illusory and mankind would have to wait
       for a long time for the solution of these problems. That was why we had to make a decision
       today.</p>
                        <p>Noting that Fawsi had talked to the Secretary, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> suggested that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> listen not only to
       Israel, but to Arab States as well. He then pulled out of his pocket what he said was a
       report on <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>'s remarks at a closed meeting
       of Latin American countries at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and said that <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> had made some very remarkable statements on that occasion.
        <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> had said that Israel took a negative view of the
       Soviet proposal for withdrawal; that Israel demanded bilateral discussions without any
       mediator, not even in the person of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>; that Israel
       insisted on the demilitarization of the Sinai Peninsula and of the occupied part of Syria;
       that Israel would incorporate the Gaza strip and the West Bank of Jordan; that it would
       establish control over all of Jerusalem; and that the refugee problem should be taken up only
       after a settlement. No Arab could ever agree to such demands. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that he believed that today was the time of responsible decision
       and that we could find and make such a decision.</p>
                        <p>The President said he agreed with both points in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s last statement, namely, that today was a time of
       responsible decision and that such a decision could be found. For our part, we had listed the
       various elements for such a decision. We were talking to Arab states, listened to them, and
       were seeking a fair decision which would be acceptable to all parties concerned, regardless
       of what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> might <pb n="550" xml:id="pg_550" facs="0578"/>have said. We had been working on this in the Security Council and intended to
       continue our efforts. While withdrawal could perhaps reduce some fears, it would not resolve
       the basic problem and the situation would be the same as now.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said this was bad; he had hoped that the
       President would support withdrawal, since withdrawal would be a just and fair step to remove
       the results of aggression. However, the President supported the aggressor. He was apparently
       under pressure by some Zionist forces, which existed everywhere, and which wished to seize
       Arab territory. Thus there might be a long and grim war in the area like the one that had
       taken place in Algeria. Millions of people might perish, the world would be in a state of
       tension, and Israel would have to return to the previous situation because time had passed
       when territories could be seized; no one, and certainly not the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, would permit such seizures.</p>
                        <p>The President said he agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s last statement. As to who had perpetrated aggression, we had
       a different view. He did not wish to engage in any name calling, but we could have held the
       situation down had it not been for Nasser's threats to liquidate Israel, movement
       of his troops, and the closure of Aqaba. It was these actions that identified the perpetrator
       of aggression.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> wondered why Israel had not raised these
       questions in the Security Council. For example, the Security Council could have taken a
       decision on Aqaba, but Israel had preferred to strike with its Air Force instead. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had spoken of Israel's elimination only after
       the beginning of the hostilities, when passions were running high. As the President knew, he,
       Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, had said in his statement that the Soviet
       Union supported the existence of Israel. The Soviet Union had voted for the establishment of
       the state of Israel, and had had diplomatic relations with it. The Soviet Union did not care
       if Jews or Arabs lived in that area, all it wanted was peace. But now, if the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> could not agree to a peaceful settlement, it would incur the
       wrath of hundred million Arabs, who would remember this for a long time. As to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, it would do everything to prevent fighting in the Middle
       East, and at the same time it would do everything to bring about withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>The President said that as for the United States, we would do everything to bring about
       peace based on all elements, including withdrawal, passage in Aqaba and the Suez, solution of
       the refugee problem, etc. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would do so in the General
       Assembly; if it were to fail there, it would work in the Security Council; and if it were to
       fail in the Security Council as well, it would work with all nations concerned. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would like to have disclosure of arms, for such a measure would
       exert influence on the nations in the area as well as on those supplying arms. Such a step
       would be a contribution to the cause of <pb n="551" xml:id="pg_551" facs="0579"/>peace.
       However, if the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> were to ship arms to those nations for
       war, then the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would have to see what it ought to do in the
       area. We were now rendering aid to several countries in the area; some of the aid was in
       armaments but most of it was economic. We would like to see the day when we could join with
       the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in seeking solution to such questions as
       desalinization of water for the area and other economic problems, instead of spending money
       on arms as both of us, including the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to a certain degree,
       were now doing. The President reiterated that we would be searching for common language in
       the General Assembly and if our efforts were to fail there we would seek it in the Security
       Council. If we were to fail in the Security Council as well, we would be searching for a
       common cause in the area. We had understanding for the Soviet position and views even if we
       did not share them. Yet if the Soviet position included only withdrawal and no other
       elements, we could not agree; we believed that other elements should be looked at as
       well.</p>
                        <p>At this point, the President received information about the various possibilities for Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s return to New York. After a
       brief discussion, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> indicated that he would
       prefer to go by helicopter at 5:45 p.m.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> then said that in the statement he was
       going to make later today, he would indicate that in connection with the situation in the
       Middle East, the two sides had stated their respective positions. On the Soviet side, it was
       stated that Israel, which had committed aggression, should withdraw its forces behind the
       armistice line without delay. This was the key question in reestablishing peace in the Middle
       East; it was in the focus of the General Assembly, and it should be positively resolved
       without delay. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that upon return to
       Moscow he would have to state with great regret all the differences between the two sides and
       the seriousness of the situation. He said he understood the US position and that he could
       assure the President that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would do everything
       possible to prevent another war in the area. Nevertheless, war was bound to break out again.
       For the two sides there now had a military confrontation which could produce accidents; a
       couple of soldiers might fire needlessly and this could result in war. However, that war
       could be prevented today.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would fully cooperate in
       keeping war from breaking out again, and we believed that another step in that direction
       would be to agree on the question of supply of armaments to that area. Such a step would at
       least restrain arms buildups in the area. He would urge Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to try to find
       common language and to see if any progress could be made.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said there was no chance for progress
       since we could not do anything without the Arabs and they would not agree to anything <pb n="552" xml:id="pg_552" facs="0580"/>the President had suggested. However, they could agree
       on Aqaba. He believed that the Arabs would agree on Aqaba after the General Assembly had
       recommended withdrawal; the question of Aqaba could be raised in the Security Council and the
       Arabs would agree there. However, this depended on the US; in fact, everything depended on
       the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. He was very sorry that so little time was left for
       this discussion, but the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> wanted to do everything to
       eliminate the conflict, and now everything depended on the United States.</p>
                        <p>The President said he believed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> felt
       this way about the need to eliminate the conflict and wanted him to know that we felt the
       same way. However, withdrawal would not resolve the problem since it did not deal with the
       other problems relating to life in the area. We did not believe withdrawal alone would be
       fair to Israel or the Arabs; other questions involved in national life in the area should
       also be included.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> observed that when in a boxing match one
       of the boxers struck a foul blow, the umpire took the boxers by their necks and drew them
       apart. It was this that had to be done in the Middle East now.</p>
                        <p>Observing the jest that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was a good
       boxer, the President said that we had tried to keep the boxers apart all along, even before
       the fighting started. In any event, it seemed to him that our two sides had a common purpose
       and the Secretary would see what to do with the Arabs and others.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that the Secretary would not be
       able to do anything; he had studied the Arab position very carefully and he knew what he was
       talking about.</p>
                        <p>The President said that we would still continue our search for common language.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the question of a non-proliferation treaty, the President said he wished to note
       that the question of Article III was not an issue between the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, but rather between the states members of <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>, and the others. Members of <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> were influenced in their stand especially by the position taken by France.
       Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had told the Secretary that the Soviet
       side would be talking with the French on this subject. What we would like to know now was if
       the Soviet side would agree to table the treaty without Article III and to work urgently on a
       solution of the Article III problem. Such work could include discussions between the
       Secretary and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. This would, of course, be
       necessary if the Soviet side could not accept our language on Article III. At the same time,
       the President said, we were committed to our Allies not to discuss alternative language for
       Article III before it was discussed with them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that the Soviet side had spoken
       with Couve yesterday and that the latter had said that France had no objection to <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                            <pb n="553" xml:id="pg_553" facs="0581"/>safeguards and would not insist on <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> safeguards. In other words, France would accept <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary, who at this point joined in the conversation, said that this was a very
       important piece of information; it did not appear to be the same as what France had been
       saying in <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> and therefore it might indicate an
       important development in the French position. We, therefore, have to find out what it really
       meant. We hoped, however, that we could table the draft treaty with Article III if possible,
       and without Article III if necessary. Any revision of our proposed Article III would require
       consultations with our Allies.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> pointed out that the French, who had
       been said to have objected to Article III, had now accepted <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards. However, he of course had no objection to US consultations with
       the Allies</p>
                        <p>At this point, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> also joined the group, and the President read to Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> the draft of a statement he was planning to
       make on the talks after the conclusion of the meeting. He pointed out that the purpose of the
       statement was to narrow the differences rather than to increase them. On the other hand, the
       statement which the Chairman had referred to might be appropriate for use in his capital or
       at UN but would not be helpful right after the meeting.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was at first quite reluctant to agree to
       what he kept calling a joint statement, saying that he could not say at the end of the
       meeting anything different from what he would say later. However, after some discussion, and
       after the draft of the proposed statement by the President was changed to eliminate
       references to the subjects discussed, he agreed to make a statement after the meeting which
       would include merely those paragraphs from his lengthier draft dealing with the talks and
       their usefulness in general terms only.<note n="4" xml:id="d235fn4">For text of both
        men's remarks immediately following the meeting, see Public Papers of the
        Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>,
        1967, Book I, pp. 650–651.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The President then said he wished to inform Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> of an extremely important matter. He said we had direct evidence of
       Cuba's encouragement of guerilla operations in seven Latin American countries.
       This was a form of aggression and was dangerous to peace in the Hemisphere as well as in the
       world at large. He pointed out that Soviet-manufactured arms coming from Cuba had been seized
       in Venezuela in July 1966 and in May 1967, with seven Cubans having been captured in this
       latter incident. He also wished to point out that on March 13 of this year, Castro had openly
       stated his support for this type of activity. The Government of Venezuela had stated its
       determination to put an end to such operations. Our Ambassador to the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> and some of his colleagues from the Organization were now investigating <pb n="554" xml:id="pg_554" facs="0582"/>in Venezuela the evidence of those activities. The
       President emphasized that he therefore strongly felt that Castro should be convinced to stop
       what he was doing.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> did not comment on this statement.</p>
                        <p>After Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> had withdrawn, the
       President said that he was going to give a paragraph to the Chairman but that since the
       latter's message to him had been oral, he would also state the paragraph orally so
       that the Chairman could transmit it if he was willing to do so. The President then read the
       following text:<note n="5" xml:id="d235fn5">See the attachment to <ref target="#d233">Document 233</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>After the message had been read and translated, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SVM1">Sukhodrev</persName> was given an opportunity to check his notes against the English text
       so as to assure their accuracy and completeness.</p>
                        <p>The President then stated that he had understood the Chairman at their earlier meeting as
       having indicated that if the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> stopped the bombing, the
        <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would sit down at the conference table within a day or
       two. Was this correct? The Chairman affirmed this understanding.</p>
                        <p>Stressing the need for complete confidence between the Chairman and himself, as well as the
       need for avoiding any misunderstandings, the President then also read a statement which he
       said was addressed to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and was not intended
       for transmittal. The statement read as follows:<note n="6" xml:id="d235fn6">See <ref target="#d233">Document 233</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that this matter would remain
       strictly confidential between the President and himself. The message would be transmitted
       promptly and if and when a reaction was received, the United States would be immediately
       informed. In response to the President's question if he had any comment on the
       message, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that although it contained
       certain qualification, it looked all right to him on the whole.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> then thanked the President for the
       opportunity of meeting with him and having these talks. He regretted that no agreement had
       been reached on the question of the Middle East, pointing out that this was not the fault of
       the Soviet side. He said he would urge that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> work with Fawsi, who
       was here and had something on his mind. He wanted to ask the President to seriously consider
       the question of pulling apart the troops in the Middle East. The President could rest assured
       that whatever the circumstances and whatever public pronouncements might be made, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> wished peace. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> did
       not wish a confrontation with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> anywhere and the two
       countries had no conflict in any part of the world. When an acute situation arose somewhere
       in the world, the two parties <pb n="555" xml:id="pg_555" facs="0583"/>should consult. The
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> should not believe those who are trying to raise questions
       between our two countries. As he had written to the President, there were some in the world
       who wanted issues to arise between our two countries. Peking was obviously one of those; he
       certainly did not exclude this possibility. After all, the President had seen what hullabaloo
       they had raised in Peking in connection with his trip to New York; Peking was saying that he
       was here to sell out someone, but obviously neither he nor the President had sold out to
       anyone. He had spoken frankly and openly, and the President could see how acute the situation
       was. There were a lot of questions that he and the President could discuss, including the
       nuclear explosions that were going on, and he was very sorry that time was so short. Our two
       countries must remove the hotbeds of war wherever they might occur. He hoped that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would be able to persuade Israel to take a more reasonable
       position. He had definite information that otherwise there would be a new war in the area.
       Israel was now intoxicated with victory and this was very dangerous.</p>
                        <p>The President said he thought such meetings should take place every year.<note n="7" xml:id="d235fn7">In a message to the President dated 10:30 p.m., June 24, Harry McPherson
        made a case for having annual visits. Such an arrangement would take the
        “political edge” off an agreement merely to visit Moscow in 1968, an
        election year, and would also show “that we can meet and deal with our problems
        regularly, in times of calm and crisis.” (Johnson Library, National Security
        File, Country File, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, Vol. XV)</note> Perhaps Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and he could agree now to set aside a week
       every year during which all the problems could be discussed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> noted that the President and he had the
       hot line which they could use whenever necessary, as they had done last time. In this
       connection, he wanted to apologize for having awakened the President so early in the
        morning.<note n="8" xml:id="d235fn8">See <ref target="#d217">Document 217</ref>.</note>
       However, he believed that the President and he had accomplished more on that one day than
       others could accomplish in three years.</p>
                        <p>The President said that this was the reason why he wanted to have a meeting every year.
       Such a meeting would involve a general review of the situation and the various problems. It
       would take place periodically rather than only when there was a crisis.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> reiterated his hope that the President
       would give the Secretary instructions to get down to business with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and Fawsi and would also permit the Secretary to be
       more flexible.</p>
                        <p>The President said the Secretary would be flexible. We did not wish to sell out anyone, but
       withdrawal alone would not be effective. At the same time, he was not sure Fawsi was giving
       the same story to the Soviet side and to us.</p>
                        <pb n="556" xml:id="pg_556" facs="0584"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> stressed that withdrawal was the main
       point, saying that other points could be raised in the Security Council. Perhaps Aqaba could
       be raised in the Security Council simultaneously with the consideration of the
       withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>The President then said he wished to draw the Chairman's attention to his
       statement concerning Cuban activities and that Castro should be persuaded to stop them. Also,
       he wanted to point out that the clock was ticking and that he did not know how long he could
       postpone his recommendation to Congress on the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> question.
       On non-proliferation, the information Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> gave
       us on the French position was very interesting and we hoped that rapid progress could be made
       on this question. He also wanted to stress the importance he attached to the question of arms
       disclosure and reduction of military budgets.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said he would consult the collective
       leadership in Moscow, but he wished to point out that the main problem was to eliminate the
       hotbeds of war. One could not do those other things if such hotbeds continued to exist.</p>
                        <p>The President said he too hoped that dangerous situations in the world could be eliminated,
       citing Viet-Nam, Cuba and the Dominican Republic as examples. As to Viet-Nam, he hoped that
       the message that he had given the Chairman would be promptly transmitted. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that it would be transmitted today and that any
       reaction would be conveyed to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> as soon as received.</p>
                        <p>The President concluded the conversation by saying he did not believe the Chairman wanted
       any confrontation or any war with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. The same was true of
       us. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> certainly does not want any confrontation or war
       with the Soviet Union, and he would personally do everything to remove tensions between our
       two countries and prevent any such development. He fully agreed that the Chairman and he
       would have to talk about the nuclear explosions the Chairman had referred to, and he knew
       exactly what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had in mind.</p>
                        <p>The meeting ended at 6:20 p.m.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary said we were very much concerned at an electro-magnetic signal directed
       against our Chancery building in Moscow. The radiation from this signal was of a level higher
       than Soviet experts considered safe. We did not know the purpose of this activity and he was
       not suggesting that it was intended to harm our personnel but he asked that the matter be
       investigated and the activity stopped.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> expressed skepticism and asked if we
       were really sure of what the Secretary had said.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> said there was no doubt whatever
       about it. This had been going on for some time. He drew a rough diagram to indicate where the
       signal was coming from and where it was directed.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said there was similar activity
       directed both against the Soviet Mission in New York as well as the Soviet Embassy in
       Washington.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> indicated he would look into the

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>: I think I'm a little
       better.</p>
                        <p> Johnson: I wanted to call you. I waited until he got through with his press conference. He
       played about the same old broken record in private that he did in public. We tried to get
       agreement on four or five points. We may have made a little progress on non-proliferation.
       We're going to have <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> work on it some tomorrow. We may be able to table an
       agreement, but we are not positive. It looked like there was some movement on arms limitation
       and on arms shipment and on disclosure and on reducing military expenditures, cutting our
       budget down for nuclear weapons or for offensive or defensive missile systems, etc. We both
       agreed in general principle, but he never would set a time and never would set a place and
       never would get down to really executing it. It was just largely
       conversation—pleasant, no vitriolic stuff, no antagonistic stuff, no bitter stuff,
       two or three little low blows below the belt every now and then. When you'd meet
       him the same way why he would get back to the normal level. He made clear they
       didn't want any confrontation with the United States, didn't want to
       fight us, didn't want to go to war.</p>
                        <p>But on the Middle East just one simple instruction—looked like he
       couldn't move one inch away from it on anything: there must be complete, absolute,
       immediate withdrawal of troops, period. Nothing else with it. That was going to be their
       resolution. They could pass that in the General Assembly. They wanted us to support it there
       and in the Security Council, and nothing else, and that unless and until that would be done,
       there was going to be a big great war, and those people would be fighting for ten years, that
       they would have to support the Arab nations, that he couldn't understand why
       we'd want to support the Jews—3 million people when there are 100
       million Arabs. I told him that numbers did not determine what was right. We tried to do what
       was right regardless of the numbers, and we felt like we'd have to take in
       maritime passage, that we'd have to consider where they were before they closed
       the Gulf, and if they were going to go back to the Armistice line, they were going to have to
       go back to the Gulf of Aqaba as it was. He <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0587"/>said well
       that would have to be done later and take two or three years to work out all these other
       things. Wouldn't give an inch on that.</p>
                        <p>On Vietnam he said we've got to stop our bombing. We've got to pull
       out. That's what he said on television. Got to get all of our troops out. That
       we're an aggressor there. We are an invader there. We are a perpetrator of
       aggression, and not anything else will do, no substitute. We exchanged some views, and I
       asked some questions of him in that connection. Asked him what would happen if we stopped our
       bombing. Would they talk, and if so how long, and would it just be another Korea talk to
       delay it, or would it be serious, or what would come from it, and what could he guarantee or
       underwrite or assure, or what did he think? The net of it was just another line. Stop your
       bombing. Send your troops home. Then things will work out.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>: And then after that we will start
       talking?</p>
                        <p> Johnson: Yup. Then—but I submitted him some questions, things to think about,
       and his folks. I asked him to let <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> sit down
       and talk to him about disarmament and give me the name and the date and the time and place.
       He would always dodge it. He claimed to be for it in principle but specifically he
       wouldn't. He claimed that there should be other elements taken into the Middle
       East settlement, but he wouldn't do any of them until withdrawal was effected. The
       Latin America thing, I gave him, told him, there were 6 or 7 hot spots, that they are using
       Soviet material—Cuba was—that we caught a bunch of them the other day
       in Venezuela, that they were giving us hell in the Dominican Republic and Haiti and Bolivia
       and half a dozen places, that this is a very serious matter, Soviet equipment, Castro-trained
       people. So—[speaking to someone nearby] Give me one of those, will you? [Speaking
       again to <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>] He ought to realize that we
       thought this was very serious and we were going to have to take action. The <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> was going to take action. Would he give me his judgment, his
       comments and what he could do about it? He said he couldn't comment now but he was
       leaving for Cuba tomorrow and he would bear these things in mind in talking to them. Acted
       like he was a little upset with Castro. Didn't say so. I guess that's
       about all.</p>
                        <p>He has an obsession on China, and just said we better understand that they are very
       dangerous people, and we'd better start talking about their exploding these
       nuclear weapons. They are trying to promote this. We're just their stooges. He
       kind of makes the same speech about us as China makes about him. He said they all charged me
       with selling out to you. Said you know what the Chinese are saying. You know what the Arabs
       are saying. Said I want to ask you if you think I have sold anyone out. I said, yes, you sold
       me out, but you haven't sold them out. You're staying awfully close to
       them. He laughed. I'd think that was about it. I thought he was less vituperative
       and antagonistic <pb n="560" xml:id="pg_560" facs="0588"/>and vicious and cutting and
       debating and argumentative than I have expected him to be, than <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> has been and Mikoyan or any of the rest of them. He's pretty
       stolid, pretty stubborn. I felt like—one time we got into Cuba someway, and I said
       well you talk about you don't believe us, you think that we let Israel have some
       arms, troop carriers or whatever it was, tanks or planes I think he said. I said we have
       tried to give them very little arms. Most of our aid has been economic aid. That's
       not true with all the countries. Your aid there has been mostly military and much more
       sizeable than ours. Then you've helped others. I remember you've had a
       good many missiles in Cuba. He just flared up big, waved his finger at me, said I want you to
       know I opposed that, I fought that, I tried to keep <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> from doing it, and when he did it I made him back up and get out.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>: Funny thing, I've heard
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> blame his predecessors and so on.</p>
                        <p> Johnson: And then another thing, he said, I want you to know we are grateful to the
       American people. We fought by your side. I was in Leningrad. I was Stalin's deputy
       12 years, and we remember your great war against fascism and you were with us and you were
       patriots and we are awfully grateful and will never forget it, but he didn't show
       a damn bit of evidence of it in anything he said on any of these things.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p> Johnson: And I held back about the meeting because I know these meetings—you
       just stir up a lot of hopes and you don't get anything till the night he is due to
       go home, and he put off a day. I finally made Rusk go over it carefully, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> with <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>.
       And then I got <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> to go over it with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. Then I got <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
       to go over it with him himself, and he assured us there'd be substantive talks. We
       could take up any of these things and get his opinion. And I would say in fairness, as a
       teacher, I would grade him about a B plus on discussions on arms, that is offensive and
       defensive missiles, the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>, and I think that when he gets
       back he'll probably set a date. But he didn't assure me of that. He did
       assure me that they would talk before he came here, but I just kept trying to get the time
       and place. I'd send <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> or whoever he
       wanted any place. We'd talk in Geneva, we'd talk in Moscow,
       we'd talk here, we'd talk at the ambassadorial level. The main thing
       that I've told Congress, I said I've had them waiting three months. I
       don't think I ought to go on this with a big appropriation here if there is any
       chance of our reasoning this thing out. But he never did say what he'd do, but I
       believe I made a little progress there. I believe we've made a little step closer
       in non-proliferation. I think that he thinks that we are not wild men. I believe I made a
       good impression on him from the standpoint of being prudent, being firm and being determined
       and not being a fraidycat or a bully either.</p>
                        <pb n="561" xml:id="pg_561" facs="0589"/>
                        <p>And he made one or two passes that I don't want to discuss with anyone but you,
       but he said I want you to know that if you do not deliver Israel here on this
       resolution—withdrawal—and you cannot pull these fighters back like you
       do two boxing men in the rings and separate the combatants and you pull them back to where
       they were before this war started then I want you to know there's going to be a
       big war and there's going to be a great war and it's coming soon. And I
       said well now Mr. Chairman I hope that there's not going to—and he said
       they'll fight with their fists and they will fight with arms. I said now if
       you're saying that the Israelis and the Arabs are going to have some further
       difficulties, I hope they don't. I'm going to do everything I can to
       keep them from fighting. I hope you do everything you can to keep them from fighting. But if
       you are saying that it goes beyond that area, and others will be fighting, then you are
       speaking very serious business, something that concerns me greatly, and I think it should
       concern you. He backed away from it and said well I said that they would be fighting out
       there, and I said well, I'll do all I can to keep them from fighting and hope you
       do too. He made another pass this afternoon along the same line. I met him the same way and
       he backed off from it again. I said I was talking about “they” would be
       fighting, he said.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>: This thing about China—our
       concern and his concern about it. Did he make any specific suggestion or express any specific
       thought?</p>
                        <p> Johnson: No. He said we ought to have another conference on that. And you better be real
       concerned about these explosions. I said we are. He said that's a matter that we
       ought to talk about at another conference. I said we're ready any time.
       I'd be glad to have one every year and set a time for it. We could stack up every
       problem we got, every bilateral situation, and you could come here or we could come
       there.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>: When you sent Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> down here the other evening, he gave me a good
       briefing. Then I suggested to him a thought that I have been talking with some people, and I
       told him if he had a chance to, to convey it to you. And I said as I study this problem,
       there are two in the Mideast—two problems—that have got to be settled
       before there is ever going to be even a modus operandi there in the Mideast. And one of them
       is these waters and the other one is these refugees. Now they can be tied up it seems to me
       if we could set up a scheme, a corporation, world corporation something like they started out
       with the Suez Canal or this atomic thing in Vienna. Suppose our government bought 51 percent
       of the stock and then we built in succession three great big salt purification plants in the
       Levant, the Eastern Mediterranean, and sell the stock to bankers all around the world and so
       on and make the water problem there—I mean a water solution—make it so
       attractive that both sides would almost be compelled <pb n="562" xml:id="pg_562" facs="0590"/>by their people to take it. For example, I've been talking to some of these AEC
       people, or scientific people. They say that it's not too expensive a thing, that
       you could put 500 million up to a billion gallons a day and water much of Israel, Jordan,
       Egypt east of the Suez, and some of Syria probably. Well now if we could get up a thing like
       that we not only would employ thousands and thousands of people and bring lots of land into
       cultivation. You see we had that old Jordan River thing that Eric Johnston had developed and
       the Arabs turned that down because they said they didn't want the Israeli to get
       any benefit out of that. But here, this would be 20 times the benefit of that, dams on the
       Jordan, and it would be so attractive it seems to me to both sides that we might create an
       atmosphere where they themselves could do something.</p>
                        <p> Johnson: I broached that to him this afternoon. I didn't get any comment. I
       told him that our people had talked to me about it just before the meeting. He said well, I
       just want to say this: I don't think we can talk about anything else until we get
       the troops withdrawn. Said we are refugees in a fight and you got to get your man by the nape
       of the neck and I have to got to get our man by the nape of the neck and you've
       got to separate them and put them back in their corner. Said then we can talk about other
       things.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>: [Unintelligible] about their man, though,
       they will have to pick him up and revive him. [Both men laugh.] That's the
       difference. I'll tell you, I have been through several of these things, and I know
       they are frustrating and you just have to guess. Now in '55, Mr. President, we
       came out of there—they agreed to a half a dozen things and signed up: unification
       of Germany, and broadening of contacts between our two countries. So in October we sent our
       foreign ministers back to implement these things. But we took up 17 different ideas and they
       turned nyet every one of them, every one. I don't know—they talk a
       little bit but I've seen no yielding yet to any of them.</p>
                        <p> Johnson: He came over here, in my judgment, the way I evaluated it, to give Israel hell,
       and to give us hell and try to get some of this polecat off of him. He smelled bad in sending
       them all that arms, and just, by God, getting whipped in three days, and he wanted to divert
       the attention and get us on the defensive, and give us hell, and we didn't engage
       him, we just kind of let him falter up there. He was pretty much a flop. Then he started
       raising hell with every do-gooder in this country to have a conference. And I said well
       let's see what we can do. I want to prepare for it and what are we going to talk
       about? They said everything from just a courtesy call to just to meet with him, an
       exploratory conference. And I finally made Rusk go up and start out with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and go to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and then go to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> himself
       and say now we're ready to meet with you but you come to Washington or you <pb n="563" xml:id="pg_563" facs="0591"/>go to Camp David. Wouldn't go to Camp David
       because <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had been there. [<persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> laughs.] Wouldn't come to Washington
       because the Chinese and the Arabs would give him hell, and wanted me to come and sit down in
       the United Nations, and I said I'm not going to do that. By God, every time a man
       gets on a horse and gallops over here—he hadn't even told me
       he's here yet officially, never did tell me he was even coming.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>: Oh, I think you're absolutely
       right not to go up there and get into that.</p>
                        <p> Johnson: I will be reasonable, and I said I'd go and meet anywhere, so
       I'll meet him close to some city where we can have the correspondents file because
       there were 1,300 of them covering it, and they're going to get
       everybody's hopes up, but I'm going to try to warn them not to. And we
       did and then he wanted to talk further, and I said that's fine. He said
       he's going to not go home Friday he's going to stay first Thursday and
       then Friday and then he said he was going to stay until Monday. And I said when do you want
       to meet again? He said well anytime. I said well let's meet Sunday and so we did.
       But in the 10 hours we may have moved a little on two things. We'll have to see.
       But it's about the same experience you said just now. And I don't
       think—</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>: His talk tonight gave no light at all,
       it's just the same old—</p>
                        <p> Johnson: I thought I'd call and tell you and I sure appreciate your interest
       and your support and your help. You've been a tower of strength in every problem
       concerning the nation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>: Whenever there is anything in the country
       as a matter of fact that I can do anything, I'll carry your
       satchel—</p>
                        <p> Johnson: I'll tell you one thing you can do for me is just be damn sure you get
       well and get strong and let me know whenever you're ready and then
       we'll get our plane ready, and you can take it slow, but I don't want
       you to let yourself get run down and not take care of yourself. You just be careful because
       you've got a hell of a lot of propping up to do around here for a long time, long
       as you got me. [Johnson laughs.]</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>: Well, I'll tell you. You know
       if you could just pass on [thinking that you had gotten these people to do anything]
       constructive and reasonable, [it would be great].<note n="2" xml:id="d237fn2">The bracketed

                        <p rend="center">LIMITATIONS AT GLASSBORO</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. June 23, 1967 (a.m.)</p>
                        <p>The President hoped that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> could assure
       him that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> would get to talk to his
       representatives concerning control of the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> rights. He
       hoped we could announce that such talks would take place. Three months ago the Chairman had
       informed him that he was prepared to undertake such discussions, yet nothing further had
       happened … we should be able to tell our people today that we would undertake
       discussions concerning the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems; even if we disagreed
       on many aspects of this problem, discussions in themselves would prove to be a step in the
       right direction.</p>
                        <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said, referring to the
       President's view of the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems, it was not
        <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s that were the root and the cause of trouble and tension
       in the world. To a much greater extent this was due to the development beyond reason of
       offensive weapons systems.</p>
                        <p>The President said he had brought Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to this meeting and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> was anxious to sit down with Soviet military representatives to discuss
       and explore possibilities of preventing an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> race between
       the two countries.</p>
                        <pb n="565" xml:id="pg_565" facs="0593"/>
                        <p>At lunch, at the President's request, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> discussed with Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
       some aspects of arms control. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
       urged that the U.S. and the Soviet Union agree to the limitation of nuclear
       arms—both offensive and defensive; putting a limitation on their development in
       both countries.</p>
                        <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said he did not quite agree with
       this view of preventing a race in <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems development. He
       said: Supposing we were to agree that no <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems were to
       be developed at all, but that it would be perfectly all right to continue to develop
       defensive weapons; what could mankind possibly hope to gain from this type of approach
       … He would agree with the Secretary if the Secretary would agree to consider the
       entire complex of the arms race in offensive and defensive weapons. (Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> reiterated that he did not suggest control or
       limitation of defensive weapons only, but on both.) <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> suggested that the subject be further explored through Ambassadors
        <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. (Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> repeated his
       criticism of a recent speech by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
       which had led <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> to conclude that the U.S.
       favored a commercial approach to the problem.)</p>
                        <p>In the afternoon the President said he believed the Chairman had misunderstood Secretary
        <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, and he wanted the Chairman to understand
       very clearly that when we proposed discussions on <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
       systems, we had in mind not only defensive but also offensive weapons.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> replied that he was still shocked by Secretary
        <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s speech in which he had
       referred to offensive weapons being cheaper than defensive weapons.</p>
                        <p>The President urged <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> to further explore
        <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s views. The President thought
       that either the Chairman or his representatives could carry on a dialogue with Secretary
        <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and profit by it.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. June 25, 1967</p>
                        <p>The President said he was most anxious to have a chance to explore all possibilities for
       cutting down the military budget if the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could be
       persuaded to do the same. We were ready to discuss all aspects of this question; we had asked
       for such talks three months ago through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> and yet nothing further had been heard since the Soviet Government had
       indicated that it was willing to discuss these matters. When and where could Secretary
        <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> meet with representatives of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to begin meaningful discussions?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that he and his government were
       indeed interested in finding means to reduce military expenditures, but this very <pb n="566" xml:id="pg_566" facs="0594"/>much depended upon relations with the U.S… It seemed
       to him that while the Viet Nam war continued a discussion of budget reduction could not be
       more than academic.</p>
                        <p>The President said a budget increase could be prevented if agreement were reached with the
       Soviet Union on the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> problem. He had held back on
       authorizing full development of <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems to provide the
       opportunity for full exploration of this question with the Soviet Union. President Johnson
       repeated: When and where could Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
       meet with Soviet representatives?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that our proposals appeared to extend to
       a discussion of weapons systems only and that he could not agree with such an approach.</p>
                        <p>President Johnson retorted that we definitely are exploring all possibilities for reducing
       expenditures for offensive as well as defensive systems.</p>
                        <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that if the President really
       wanted to discuss disarmament measures he was prepared to come here from Moscow with a
       delegation of his experts for this purpose, but he still failed to see true possibilities
       while the Viet Nam war continues and while the Middle East situation remains unsettled.</p>
                        <p>After lunch the President said the arms problem was of extreme importance to us, and we
       would like to discuss such questions as offensive and defensive missile systems, as well as
       expenditures in general, military budgets, and arms i.e. arms sales to other countries. The
       two sides should have meetings to discuss how they both could reduce their arms budget and
       also to discuss all other relevant questions. If he had understood the Chairman correctly as
       saying that he was willing to have his representatives meet with our people on these
       questions, he should give the time and the place and they could meet.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> noted that the President had raised the
       arms question first. He said that in his view the situation in the Middle East and the war in
       Viet Nam should be discussed first inasmuch as both of these questions, and particularly the
       war in Viet Nam, had a direct bearing on the arms question.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>It looks as if the Soviets are persisting in their refusal to send their Festival of
        Arts<note n="2" xml:id="d239fn2">A troupe of 200 singers and dancers, also called the
        Festival of Stars.</note> to the United States. The Secretary raised the matter again with
        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> last Saturday and <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Foy Kohler</persName> has raised it with <persName corresp="#p_TYN1">Tcherniakov</persName>—in both cases without a definite answer. However, the
       Soviet Embassy told <persName corresp="#p_HS1">Hurok</persName>
                            <note n="3" xml:id="d239fn3">Impresario Sol Hurok.</note> yesterday that the tour is
       “indefinitely postponed.” As for the reasons, I think it is pretty
       clear that the Soviets feel uncomfortable about Hollybush and any impression to the world
       that we and they are moving toward a better, or parallel relationship. The Mid-East is still
       smarting and their setbacks in New York don't help. The Festival of Arts group
       would be opening at the Lincoln Center in six days—which is a particularly poor
       place. Yuri Zhukov made some remarks to <persName corresp="#p_HS1">Hurok</persName>'s man in Moscow about concern over anti-Soviet demonstrations in
       New York. Madame Furtseva, the Minister of Culture, was probably closer to the real reason
       when she said to <persName corresp="#p_HS1">Hurok</persName> that the Mid-East crisis was the
       problem.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets have said informally that we should not regard this as affecting other
       exchanges, although this could be a stall. We shall soon see, as a circus exchange (with the
       American circus going to the Soviet Union) is in the offing. In general, the Soviets have
       regarded their attractions coming to the United States as in their interest—as
       well as big money makers. Therefore they are paying something for cancelling the Festival of
       Arts (as is Sol Hurok, who claims he stands to lose one-third of a million dollars). With the
       Secretary having made two personal representations to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and with other approaches to the Russians here and in Moscow, it is
       difficult to see there is much we can or should do about this—particularly as it
       has been our consistent <pb n="568" xml:id="pg_568" facs="0596"/>position that it is up to
       the Soviets whether they want to bring attractions to this country. I doubt if a personal
       intervention by the President would be effective, and do not recommend it.</p>

       which confirmed that the Soviets had given “the international

       indicate that with the Mid-East, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, etc., the Soviets
       seem to have been casting about for a gesture that is conspicuous, but not necessarily of
       deep policy significance.</p>

        from Oslo to the Department of State, July 20, George Kennan told <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> that he found it difficult to understand the need for
        postponing publication of Svetlana Alliluyeva's Twenty Letters to a Friend, which
        Harper &amp; Row planned to publish in early October, shortly before the Soviet
        Union's 50th anniversary celebration, since the book was not primarily political
        or even autobiographical and the U.S. Government had no part in the decision to publish it.
        (Ibid.)</note> For Kennan from <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>.</p>
                        <p>1. Soviets repeatedly made clear they consider that publication date just before jubilee to
       which they attach enormous importance is proof that US Government is deliberately exploiting
       Svetlana in a cold war move. Publication will re-focus attention on her defection regardless
       of content. I am convinced that delay of four or five weeks would gain us great credit here
       and would affect some pending issues. Admit there may be little in this for Svetlana but if
       Soviets should learn that she had prevented postponement they would be even more bitter
       toward her. Unlikely but possible this could affect status of children.</p>

                        <p>On July 20, 1967, the intelligence community issued National Intelligence Estimate 11–4–67,
       “Main Trends in Soviet Military Policy.” <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11–4–67 stated that the “Soviets almost certainly believe that their
       strategic position relative to that of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> has improved
       markedly” and that, while “Soviet foreign policy will continue to be
       based primarily upon political and economic factors,” the “military
       capabilities that the Soviets are developing and the military relationships that are evolving
       will affect their attitudes and approaches to policy, they will probably seek to gain some
       political or propaganda advantages from their improving military position, and may take a
       harder line with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in various crises than they have in
       the past.” On August 9 the President's Special Assistant <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName> forwarded <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>
       11–4–67 to President Johnson. In his covering memorandum Rostow commented that the situation
       described in the <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> was “not alarming; but I
       suspect it will be exploited as a political issue in 1968. The Soviets are increasing the
       number of their hardened <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s while we are
       increasing the number of our warheads. Therefore, it will be argued, they are
       ‘closing our nuclear superiority gap.’“ Rostow continued,
       “no one thinks we are moving to a position where a Soviet first strike is likely
       to become rational in the foreseeable future. But the numbers will be moving unfavorably over
       the coming year.” <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11–4–67 and

         Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1967–69, BG
         Moscow)</note>

                        <p>1. As you will have seen from our tel 91 July 14, Foreign Ministry, in démarche
       to Guthrie on eve his departure, has in effect rejected our proposal that Soviet proffered
       site for new <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Chancery and living quarters be extended to
       include site of our present chancery and suitable connecting avenue thereto.</p>
                        <p>2. We must consider which of various options open to us is most suitable course of action
       at this juncture when pressures are mounting on both sides for some resolution of chancery
       problem. We assume, in this respect, that Mt. Alto property cannot be reserved indefinitely
       for Soviet occupation. Similarly, we are advised that Soviets also hope for early decision
       regarding acceptability to us of site which is in area of Moscow already in process (<gloss target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss> development) of urban renovation and reconstruction.</p>
                        <p>3. I think that those of us with direct experience of our present chancery living quarters
       in Moscow need little documentation to comprehend how cramped and inadequately officed and
       housed we are. Pressures to accommodate, under suitable security safeguards, additional
       personnel and their dependents mount from year to year from all agencies of our government.
       We have already outgrown our present rabbit-warren, and it seems to me that we must, in our
       over-all national interest, give a sympathetic reading to proposals which will allow us to
       accommodate personnel and operations commensurate with our ever-increasing contact and
       involvement, at all levels, with the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>4. Soviet need for new quarters in Washington seems equally demonstrable; they will say, it
       is even more evident.</p>
                        <p>5. It is against this larger background of world powers with rapidly expanding points of
       contact that we must regard our present negotiations. The Soviet side seems prepared to
       accept Mt. Alto. In turn, <pb n="571" xml:id="pg_571" facs="0599"/>they have assured us over
       a period of months that the site presently offered, which is not rectangular in shape
       subsequent to modifications we suggested, is best they have available. We are disposed to
       accept this statement as probably accurate since our own knowledge of Moscow suggests that no
       site in city is ideal and that no properties prospected by other embassies in market for
       sites are as desirable as that offered us.</p>
                        <p>6. Shortcomings of site, i.e., present location in slum-like area, low elevation of
       property, nearness to football stadium, must be balanced against evident intent of Soviet
       authorities to reconstruct this area, which is situated very near to Foreign Ministry and
       which is already being rehabilitated with construction of <gloss target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss> complex of buildings in modern design.</p>
                        <p>7. I am fully aware of numerous considerations which militate against unconditional
       acceptance of site. These particularly include problem of low elevation of site. There is
       also need to obtain Congressional approval of over-all desirability of exchange of sites and
       construction of new <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Embassy.</p>
                        <p>8. Certainly we shall always face in Moscow greater problems with regard to efficiency of
       construction, access to materials, and availability of skilled labor than <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will face in Washington, even if there is mutual agreement
       that construction in each site proceed step-by-agreed-step. Proposed site in Moscow thus can
       never be fully equated to site offered in Washington, where quality of urban development and
       of civic and technological services greatly favors Soviet construction in Washington.
       Decision which must be taken is therefore essentially political in character. Looking to the
       longer term, and despite very fundamental differences along whole range of present policies
       and convictions, do we wish to take step accommodating our respective missions in more
       suitable quarters than either now has?</p>
                        <p>9. Subject to Washington review of certain special aspects of problem, my recommendation is
       that we accept in principle Soviet construction on Mt. Alto site in exchange for our
       construction on Soviet proffered site. Our acceptance “in principle”
       should be conveyed in terms of whatever conditions we regard as over-riding. These would
       include, of course, any reservations concerning height of buildings. I think we have in this
       connection useful argument at hand in our requirement to house growing US official population
       in Moscow on limited acreage offered by site which Soviet planners themselves hope will
       retain park-like character. For efficient use of site, tall buildings will obviously be
       required.</p>
                        <p>10. I recognize that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations are now undergoing
       perhaps more than usual strain. This need not, however, deter either country from embarking
       on useful and desirable projects of longer term significance. <pb n="572" xml:id="pg_572" facs="0600"/>In any event, I would expect some years to elapse before either project could
       be finally realized even if agreement in principle is reached in near future.</p>

                        <p>As I am sure you know, the Svetlana book publication date is the subject of activity on
       several fronts. Yuri Zhukov has been complaining about it to visiting Americans in
       Moscow—particularly Harrison Salisbury and Arthur Schlesinger. Schlesinger wrote
       letters to Harper and Row and also Leonard Marks suggesting that publication be delayed.
       Schlesinger sent Dan Schorr a flimsy of his letter to Leonard Marks, and Dan broadcasted an
       account of it over CBS this morning. This understandably infuriated Leonard Marks, but he has
       by now calmed down enough so I think he will write Schlesinger a temperate reply.</p>
                        <p>Salisbury has gotten the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> worried (I understand they
       are afraid the Soviets will throw out their Moscow correspondents—which is a good
       possibility if they start serializing the book this October). Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> has also been discussing the matter with Kennan by
       telegram (Kennan is in Oslo).<note n="2" xml:id="d243fn2">See <ref target="#d240">Document
         240</ref>.</note> Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> would like to
       see us influence Svetlana toward a brief postponement. Almost everybody in Washington
       (including me) think we should keep hands off. An official intervention would undoubtedly
       leak and there is probably enough pressure being applied as it is. It is undeniably true that
       the original selection of October for publication was unfortunate <pb n="573" xml:id="pg_573" facs="0601"/>from the point of view of our relations with the Soviets, but there is not much
       the U.S. Government can usefully do about it now.</p>

                        <p>In a long and relaxed talk with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
       in my office on the evening of July 26th, with no one else present, the following principal
       points emerged:</p>
                        <p>1. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> confirmed that it had been
       the Algerians and the Syrians who had thrown the monkey wrench into possible Arab acceptance
       of the compromise resolution worked out between <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> in New York.<note n="2" xml:id="d244fn2">For documentation on U.S.-Soviet talks in New York on the Middle East

                        </p>
                        <p>2. I pressed <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> as to whether he was trying to
       give me some message in two earlier remarks he had made about the prospective or actual
       inactivity of the 3–4 North Vietnamese divisions in and around the DMZ. I asked him if he had
       anything as to Hanoi's military policy with respect to these divisions. He said
       that he had no such special information and that he had been making purely personal remarks
       on the basis of reports reaching his Embassy in Washington.</p>
                        <p>3. I asked him once again what the Soviet Union would do about Viet-Nam if the United
       States stopped the bombing. I reminded him <pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574" facs="0602"/>that we
       had asked him that question quite some time ago and had never had any reply. He asked whether
       there was anything which the USSR could do which would make any difference to our bombing
       policy. I said I could not give him any generalized statement but it might be worth their
       trying to find out.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> stated categorically that Hanoi had
       informed Moscow last December that they were preparing to have talks with us in Warsaw but
       had informed them later that the two bombing raids in the middle of December near Hanoi made
       such talks impossible. I then went over the four month's cessation of bombing in
       the ten nautical mile circle around Hanoi and said we did not understand why if they were
       prepared to talk in early December they were not able to talk during that four month
       period.</p>
                        <p>5. We both agreed that the Glassboro talks had been worthwhile. He said that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had taken away a positive impression of the President
       and I said that I could say the same about the President's impression of <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>.</p>
                        <p>6. We had a very brisk and frank discussion of the Svetlana affair. He said it was
       inconceivable to the leaders in Moscow that the United States could not have refused Svetlana
       entry into this country, and that they therefore looked upon her admission as a deliberate
       attempt to embarrass the Soviet Union. I went over the case in great detail, including the
       difficulties we had with both the Italian and Swiss Governments and our inability to find
       another country willing to take Svetlana to which she herself was willing to go. I reminded
       him that the problem arose because of three “stupidities”:</p>
                        <p>a) The permission given to Svetlana to leave the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>;</p>
                        <p>b) The Indian refusal to permit Svetlana to remain in India unless the Soviet Ambassador
       approved; and</p>
                        <p>c) The Soviet Ambassador's handling of the affair in New Delhi.</p>
                        <p>I told him that if they had other sensitive personalities of that sort to please keep them
       at home because we don't want them.</p>
                        <p>7. We reviewed briefly the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> situation and I reiterated
       our keen desire to get some serious talks started. He offered nothing new.</p>
                        <p>8. I gave him a “helpful household hint” about contacts with the
       Congress and staff members of Congressional committees. I told him that, since Ambassadors
       are accredited to the President, it was important that any contact with the legislative
       branch be open and not appear to be covert or on the sly. I said that it did not leave a good
       impression if contacts occurred at remote out of the way places as though something was being
       hidden. I told him this was a friendly suggestion to him personally because the President has
       a great regard for him. He saw the point but said that suggestions about where to have lunch
       or to meet invariably came from our side and that his people could not <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0603"/>very well say “I can't accept your
       suggestion about where to have lunch because the State Department prefers we lunch in the
       Statler dining room.” My guess is that his Congressional contacts do, in fact,

                        <p>9. During his absence from Washington on vacation during August he clearly preferred that
       any serious contacts between us be through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> in Moscow rather than through Federenko in New York.</p>
                        <p>10. I asked him what the Communist Youth publication in Moscow meant when it charged
       Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and me with being at the head of a
       large task force of over 200 people with a mission of anti-Soviet propaganda and of
       undermining their Fiftieth Anniversary Year. He had not seen the article and so I gave him a
       copy. He made some vague references to a feeling in Moscow that we were attempting to
       discredit their Fiftieth Anniversary and referred to a large number of seminars being held in
       American universities this year with speakers hostile to the Soviet Union. I told him that it
       was inevitable that universities would pay special attention to the Soviet Union on its
       Fiftieth Anniversary. As far as our Government is concerned, I told him that I had never
       heard any reference being made to the Fiftieth Anniversary Year in policy discussions of
       particular subjects and that Soviet leaders should not suppose that their Fiftieth
       Anniversary is really taken note of in the formulation of U.S. policy. We have tried, in a
       low key handling of the Svetlana affair for example, to ease some of the sharper edges of our
       relationships during their Fiftieth Anniversary Year.</p>

                        <p>I had lunch with the Soviet Ambassador today at his invitation and talked with him from
       approximately 12:30 to 2:20.</p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador that I had made my usual check list of pending and upcoming questions
       between us in the hope that when he got back to Moscow he could review the status of these
       matters and induce some movement on the Soviet side. We then reviewed the items shown on the
       attached list,<note n="2" xml:id="d245fn2">Not printed. The list included: strategic weapons
        talks; non-proliferation treaty; expert talks on peaceful nuclear explosions; technical
        talks on venting; space treaty ratification; satellite weather exchange improvement; embassy
        sites; civil airline services; desalting symposia and exchanges; atomic energy exchanges;
        and “other exchanges” (Amerika/Soviet Life/Sputnik, cancellation of
        the <persName corresp="#p_HS1">Hurok</persName> Festival, and a new agreement for
        1968–1969).</note> and at his request, I left with him a copy. In the course of the
       discussion, he offered nothing really new on any of these subjects but did say that he would
       look into them after his return to Moscow.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, we did have a general review of the present Soviet posture
       vis-á-vis the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in the light of frequent Soviet
       remarks that certain things were impossible because of the international situation and,
       particularly, Viet-Nam. He claimed that there was no really fixed policy in Moscow, but that
       everything was discussed by the leadership on an ad hoc basis, and decisions were frequently
       affected by passing emotions of the moment or by the effectiveness of
       “eager-beavers” in various branches of the Soviet apparatus in
       influencing decisions one way or another. In this connection, he commented that not only he
       but also Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had been at a loss
       to understand why Moscow had cancelled the <persName corresp="#p_HS1">Hurok</persName>
       Festival on one day and three days later agree that the American Circus would be permitted to
       come ahead.</p>
                        <p>In general, he thought the Soviet posture was that relations with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> were to be handled in “low key” so long as
       Viet-Nam goes on. <pb n="577" xml:id="pg_577" facs="0605"/>He saw no reason to think that
       there would not be a new agreement on exchanges for the next bi-annual period, though he
       thought there might be considerable discussion as to the specific content of a new
        agreement.<note n="3" xml:id="d245fn3">On July 28 <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> informed <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> that he was

                        <p>When this question was put to you last May (Tab A),<note n="2" xml:id="d246fn2">
                                <ref target="#d214">Document 214</ref>.</note> your reaction was to hold it “for
       the present.”</p>
                        <p>The original idea was:</p>
                        <p>—To increase the number of American ports open to Soviet and Eastern European
       ships from 12 to about 50;</p>
                        <p>—To provide for board and search on a spot-check basis (instead of the present
       full coverage);</p>
                        <p>—To reduce advance notification from 30 days to 7.</p>
                        <p> Nick Katzenbach, <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Foy Kohler</persName> and others at the State
       Department have looked at the problem again. They have come back recommending we take only
       the third step—reducing advance notification to 7 days. The original 30-day
       requirement was a rule the State Department set up for its own convenience in processing
       visas and export licenses for bunker fuel. (The Coast Guard has never required more than 7
       days advance notice for its search and surveillance responsibility.)</p>
                        <p>The change might result in a few more Soviet and Polish freighters calling at U.S. ports,
       and this might increase the chances of labor union opposition and political flak. However,
       easing the requirement would go a long way toward quieting the Russians and preventing
       retaliation (which the Russians have threatened) against our cruise-ship calls at <pb n="578" xml:id="pg_578" facs="0606"/>Leningrad and Odessa. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> raised the matter personally with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> a few months ago.</p>
                        <p> Nick does not believe we need Congressional consultation—as it might actually
       stir up the issue over a minor administrative change. We would advise interested commercial
       shipping agents but not issue a press release. I recommend approval.</p>

        tonight,<note n="2" xml:id="d247fn2">September 27. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> was in New York for the 22nd <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General

        Department of State, <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> Files: Lot 71 D
        460.</note> the following matters were mentioned:</p>
                        <p>1. I asked <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> whether he had any further
       clarification on what he had said about our last meeting about <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>'s. I told him that I was sure that the President would want me to
       report faithfully exactly how <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> saw it.
       Specifically, was there anything that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> could
       say about the timing of negotiations? He replied that <pb n="579" xml:id="pg_579" facs="0607"/>they have been giving the matter a great deal of thought, that they consider it is a
       question which needs further development, they accept our assurance of our readiness to talk
       about both offensive and defensive missiles, and came close to stating that they did expect
       to enter into serious talks with us on the subject. He said it was just not possible for him
       to indicate anything about timing. Putting <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s remarks alongside of <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s remark on the same subject, I would gather that the
       Russians are formulating a position in the expectation of talks but are not yet ready to take
       the responsibility for setting a date and starting a process of discussion. I doubt we shall
       get much more from them, at least for the next several weeks.</p>
                        <p>2. I told <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that I was prepared to discuss
       Vietnam in great detail and that he was familiar with our position. I told him that we
       continue to be in occasional contact with Hanoi through private channels and that we had
       exercised some restraint in our own operations in connection with such contacts. I did not go
       into detail and he did not ask me for any detail. He summarized their position in familiar
       terms, insisting upon a cessation of the bombing without any indication of what the results
       of such a cessation would be. He did not even state categorically that there would be talks.
       He brushed aside any thought of reciprocal military action on North Vietnam. He showed no
       interest in discussing the matter and it was not pursued in further detail. He did not
       respond as to what the Soviets would do if we stopped the bombing.</p>
                        <p>3. We then had some discussion about China. I asked him, with a light touch, if his people
       in Moscow thought that we were in some sort of conspiracy with Peking. He seemed somewhat
       amused by the question and asked me whether I thought if Moscow really believed that such was
       the case they would not have mentioned it to us directly. We had some discussion about
       elements of future common interests, based on national state interests despite ideology, as
       we looked to the prospect of a billion Chinese armed with nuclear weapons. He said there were
       such potential common interests but did not pursue the matter.</p>
                        <p>4. On the Middle East, he confirmed that the Soviet view was based on the tentative draft
       which we and they worked out at the end of the emergency General Assembly. He thinks there
       are points of interpretation on which the two of us do not see eye to eye. I told him that we
       had heard rumors that they were moving away from that position to the Tito proposals.<note n="3" xml:id="d247fn3">Information on the Tito proposals is scheduled for publication in
         <ref target="frus1964-68v19">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964–1968, volume XIX</ref>.</note> He said, of
       course, the Tito proposals were more acceptable to the Arabs and would be entirely acceptable
       to the Soviet Union but he understood that such proposals could not produce an answer. The
       principal points of interpretation to which he alluded <pb n="580" xml:id="pg_580" facs="0608"/>were (1) the type of response expected from the Arabs if such a resolution were
       passed by the Security Council and (2) the Suez Canal. He agreed with me that the Soviets
       would not object to an opening of Suez to Israeli flagships but he saw no prospect that Egypt
       would agree. I doubt, therefore, that the Soviets will publicly support Israeli passage of
       Suez pending Arab agreement. Once again he left the impression that the Soviets are not so
       much concerned now with the Syrians and the Algerians and were prepared to work for a
       solution with which <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and the so-called moderate
       Arabs could live even if Syria and Algeria objected. He agreed that Algeria's
       distance from Israel made the Algerians rather brave. As a little bargaining pressure, he
       underlined twice the importance of the Middle East to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations, clearly inviting concessions on our side in the Arab-Soviet
       direction. We agreed that the state of belligerency must be removed but that the problem was
       to find a formula which would achieve the result without humiliating the Arabs. That will
       take some doing. It was left that we would be in further consultation with them about the
       Middle East to see if we could not clarify and tighten up the beginnings of the common
       approach we established in the emergency General Assembly. At no time was there any threat or
       bluster on his part.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> spoke to me about reports they had heard
       about our building a nuclear mine field along the Turkish border. This was a subject which
       they raised more than a year ago with both us and Turkey and he said he had not had a very
       conclusive reply from either government. I told him that I did not know very much about it
       and that I would look into it to see if there was any more that ought to be said. He said
       that if these reports were true, this would have a very negative influence on our
       relations.</p>
                        <p>6. There was considerable discussion about Article 3 of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, as well as procedures to be followed in bringing it to signature and the
       handling of the subject before the General Assembly. Details will be reported separately. It
       was agreed that <persName corresp="#p_FWC1">Foster</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> would talk further about Article 3 after the meeting of the Ministers
       of <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> next Monday.<note n="4" xml:id="d247fn4">October 1.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>7. In the general discussion after dinner, most of the time was spent on a futile argument
       about procedure on the Soviet proposal for a definition of aggression.</p>
                        <p>8. In reply to my question, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> indicated the
       Soviets would be prepared to proceed with negotiations for a new cultural agreement, possibly
       in December.</p>
                        <pb n="581" xml:id="pg_581" facs="0609"/>
                        <p>9. In a separate conversation with <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> and
        <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> suggested that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s indication on Monday that they might be ready to inaugurate
       civil air operations in October was probably a bit optimistic. He thought that Aeroflot like
       PanAm would not be keen to start operations in winter and that perhaps <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had in mind an inaugural flight this fall with regular
       operations to start next spring. He said that they were having difficulty on the question of
       liability insurance.</p>
                        <p>I could not detect any particular change in mood although I found nothing encouraging in
       his attitude about Vietnam. The evening as a whole was reasonably relaxed with no
       polemics.</p>

                        <p rend="center">The Problem</p>
                        <p>To examine recent trends in Soviet foreign policy and their bearing on the situation within
       the Soviet leadership, and to estimate the course of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s policies over the next year or two.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Summary</p>
                        <p>A. The Soviets have registered no really significant foreign policy success in recent
       years. It is true that there has been an increase of their influence in certain areas,
       especially in states on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s southern
       periphery and in the Middle East, and that they have been able to make some progress in the
       pursuit of their aims in Western Europe. But Sino-Soviet relations have continued to
       deteriorate, the trend toward declining Soviet authority in the Communist world has not
       abated, and <pb n="582" xml:id="pg_582" facs="0610"/>Soviet policy in the Third World has met
       with few particular triumphs and has encountered a number of setbacks.</p>
                        <p>B. The present collective leadership has survived for three years and no early return to
       one-man rule seems in prospect. We do believe, however, that there are persistent
       disagreements within high councils. Some of these involve domestic issues, such as the
       problem of resource allocation and of relations between the political and military
       leaderships, which have an important bearing on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s international position. Others sometimes arise directly from
       questions of foreign policy, such as Soviet conduct during the 1967 crisis in the Middle
       East.</p>
                        <p>C. The Soviet leaders have not outgrown a dogmatic attitude that the world should conform
       to the Soviet image of it, but their foreign policies often reflect an understanding that
       there are definite limits to their ability to shape and exploit the course of international
       events. We believe that this ambivalence will persist for some time and will be evident in
       the way in which the Soviet leaders grapple, or fail to grapple, with the issues of Soviet
       foreign policy. Toward the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, for example, it will probably
       be evident in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s anxiety to avoid crises
       which could lead to a confrontation, but, at the same time, its disinclination to seek a
       significant improvement of relations, its reluctance to accept extensive arms control and
       disarmament measures, and its probable refusal to try to bring any real pressure on Hanoi to
       modify its terms for a settlement in Vietnam. Elsewhere, it is likely to be evident in a
       prudent approach to China, ambiguous policies in the Arab States, and an active though wary
       campaign to expand Soviet influence in the Third World.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Discussion</p>
                        <p>1. The present period of Soviet history has assumed much of the character of a stable but
       uninspiring interregnum. No single figure has been able to dominate the political scene as
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> once did, and the country has had to
       function without the kind of forceful direction of policy that such a figure can provide. The
       present leaders, repudiating <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
       excesses of style and extremes of policy, have chosen to reign as a committee and to govern
       through compromise and consensus. They seem to recognize the complexity of the problems
       facing them and generally to appreciate the limitations placed by time and circumstance on
       their ability to seek new ways or to find new purposes. It is true, in any case—in
       contrast to the notable series of changes which occurred in the aftermath of the death of
       Stalin—that the main lines of Soviet doctrine and policy have remained
       substantially unaltered in the roughly three years since the fall of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. And nowhere is this more apparent than in the
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s approach to the great issues and events
       of world politics.</p>
                        <pb n="583" xml:id="pg_583" facs="0611"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. The Post-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
       Record</p>
                        <p>2. To most of the Soviet leaders, the view from Moscow could not have seemed very good in
       the early fall of 1964. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was still seeking
       in the main to recover from past failures—China from 1960 onwards, Berlin in 1961,
       Cuba in 1962—and he exhibited few signs of having in mind any very promising
       proposals for the future. Many of his approaches to problems must have seemed to his
       colleagues to be not only unorthodox but unrewarding. His determined efforts to rush toward
       the formal excommunication of China were actually losing ground for the USSR within the
       international movement. His flirtation with West Germany in the summer of 1964 was worrying
       his friends at home and alarming his allies in East Germany. And his apparently growing
       willingness to abandon Vietnam to the Chinese and the Americans smacked of a retreat which
       would not only violate the concept of doctrinal brotherhood but also damage the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s standing as a great power.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s successors set about
       immediately after his removal to restore convention, consistency, and momentum to Soviet
       foreign policy. Their first concern was to curtail the spread of disarray within the
       Communist world and to restore the good name of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as
       the leading Communist power. To these ends, they called off the clamorous campaign against
       Peking and strongly proclaimed renewed interest in Vietnam. They surely understood that these
       actions might lead to some deterioration of relations with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, but did not seem to believe that they would greatly increase the risks of
       confrontation. On the contrary, while probably impatient with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s intermittent appeals for détente with the
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, the new Soviet leaders also clearly disliked his
       impulsive and occasionally risky behavior and hoped that a more prudent course would enable
       them to avoid international crises directly involving both the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. They believed that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had been insufficiently
       “revolutionary” in his handling of Communist affairs but at times
       overly provocative in his dealings with the West, and they hoped somehow to redress the
       balance.</p>
                        <p>4. The early hopes of the new leadership for improved Soviet fortunes abroad have scarcely
       been fulfilled, and the record of Soviet foreign policy since 1964 must now be viewed in
       Moscow with, at best, mixed feelings. In the area of first concern, relations within the
       Communist world, there has been considerable improvement in the USSR's relative
       status vis-á-vis China. This has come about partly because of Moscow's
       insistence on unified Communist support of Hanoi, a policy which has contributed to the
       willingness of several Asian parties to move away from Peking. But the improvement in the
       Soviet position has been the consequence mainly of China's own conduct rather than
       because of any appreciable increase in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s
       international standing. Sino-Soviet relations have, in fact, continued to deteriorate <pb n="584" xml:id="pg_584" facs="0612"/>and the problem remains a serious one for the Soviet
       leaders. Moreover, the commitment to support North Vietnam involved a miscalculation, i.e.,
       the Soviet leaders' expectation of an early Communist victory in the South and
       their failure to foresee direct and massive US involvement in the war. And though, as seen
       from Moscow, the war in Vietnam has had its advantages, particularly in terms of what the
       Soviets perceive to be the increasing isolation of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, it
       has had its adverse effects as well. Chances of future difficulties and dangers, especially
       vis-á-vis the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, almost certainly appear to the
       Soviets to be growing.<note n="2" xml:id="d248fn2">For a fuller discussion of Soviet policies
        concerning Vietnam, see <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 11–11–67, “Soviet
        Attitudes and Intentions Toward the Vietnam War,” dated 4 May 1967, Secret.
        [Footnote in the source text; see <ref target="#d213">Document 213</ref>.]</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. Elsewhere in the Communist world, the trend toward declining Soviet authority, already
       well underway in <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s time, has not
       been arrested. There have been conspicuous absences from Soviet-sponsored international
       Communist conferences, and enthusiasm in other parties for Moscow's handling of
       its Middle Eastern policies has been noticeably subdued. Rumania's demonstrations
       of independence have continued, major examples being its diplomatic recognition of West
       Germany and its deviant policy toward Israel. And the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s problems with Castro's Cuba—particularly
       concerning the proper “revolutionary” policy to follow in Latin
       America—persist and have become more open.</p>
                        <p>6. Soviet policy in the Third World can claim few particular triumphs in the post-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> period. The campaign to normalize relations and lay
       the basis for expanded influence in neighboring states has made some progress, especially in
       Iran and Turkey; efforts to bolster the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s
       international prestige were well served by Moscow's success in arranging a
       cease-fire between India and Pakistan in 1965. But the Soviets have also suffered a number of
       serious setbacks in the Third World, as in Ghana and Indonesia. Moreover, while it had once
       appeared that the present Soviet leaders were approaching their Third World problems with
       greater caution and selectivity than <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, their
       judgment was called into question by the role they played in the Middle East crisis of 1967.
       Moscow apparently could not resist the opportunity to manipulate Arab-Israeli tensions, but
       the war which followed, and the defeat of the Arab forces in that war, were developments
       which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> did not desire, initially did not foresee,
       and, later, could not forestall.</p>
                        <p>7. It is in Western Europe that current policies have appeared most promising. The Soviet
       leaders have come to appreciate the grave risks involved in Soviet threats and demonstrations
       of power—as in Berlin—<pb n="585" xml:id="pg_585" facs="0613"/>and to
       comprehend that such tactics only serve to consolidate the Western alliance and the American
       presence in Europe. Their aims have remained the same—to isolate West Germany,
       disrupt NATO, and sever the close ties between Europe and the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>—but they have in recent years generally refrained from bellicose
       behavior. They have sought instead to exercise influence through more active participation in
       conventional European politics and diplomacy, through the cultivation of de Gaulle and
       France, and, in general, through emphasis on the desirability of an all-European
       détente and security system. And largely because these tactics have coincided with
       a changing climate of European opinion, there has been, in fact, a rising interest in Western
       Europe in some form of settlement with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>8. Soviet emphasis on détente in Europe has not been accompanied by any
       comparable emphasis on a resolution of differences with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. On the contrary, Soviet leaders have publicly asserted that no such resolution
       is even conceivable so long as the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is involved in the war
       in Vietnam. But they have also indicated (and, during the Middle East crisis, demonstrated) a
       strong desire to keep the lines open to Washington. And though they have at times insisted
       that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations must remain frozen for the duration
       they have been willing to conclude specific agreements (e.g., on the peaceful uses of outer
       space) and to negotiate about others (e.g., nuclear nonproliferation) when they saw larger
       advantage to Soviet policy. Thus, if <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
       demonstrated his ambivalence toward the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> by sometimes
       speaking as a friend while more often behaving like an enemy, the present leaders have
       perhaps demonstrated a similar state of mind by tending in some ways to do the opposite. In
       any case, it is clear that the leadership has been unable to resolve the contradictory
       demands of a policy which seeks, on the one hand, gains against the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in Europe and Southeast Asia and elsewhere and, on the other, a tacit
       understanding with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to avoid measures and
       countermeasures which would seriously risk major international crisis.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Foreign Policy and the Leadership</p>
                        <p>9. It has never been possible to assess the precise impact of Soviet foreign policy on the
       course of internal Soviet politics, or vice versa; the intertwining of domestic and
       international policy questions with purely internal political concerns is too intricate.
       Individual leaders seize on particular policy issues as a pretext to embarrass or defeat
       political rivals, and questions of policy often become only incidental to the struggle for
       power. It is also obvious that some of the top Soviet leaders become identified with a point
       of view and a set of policies and that their political fortunes can rise or fall partly on
       the basis of the success or failure of these policies. Certainly among the circumstances
       responsible for <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s downfall were
       the failure in 1962 of his <pb n="586" xml:id="pg_586" facs="0614"/>boldest foreign
       initiative, the Cuban missile venture, and the apparent failure in 1963 of his greatest
       domestic program, the campaign to raise agricultural production.</p>
                        <p>10. The collective leadership has survived longer than many observers anticipated. It has
       done so in part, perhaps, because it works; the leadership has for the most part been stable
       and its policies, though mostly undramatic, have generally achieved some measure of success.
       It has also done so because none of the leaders has as yet displayed the power, fortitude, or
       even the desire to upset existing arrangements. It has almost certainly not done so, however,
       because of any dearth of controversy within high councils. On the contrary, there appear to
       be at least four or five major areas of debate and discontent within the leadership, some of
       which involve, either directly or indirectly, major questions of foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>11. Economic questions, many of which have an important bearing on the USSR's
       posture abroad, have been the subject of disputes within the Soviet elite for some time.
       Indeed, such questions as how much emphasis to attach the one or another economic program,
       and how best to proceed with the allocation of investment priorities, were central to much of
       the debate and rancor which surrounded <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. In
       order to advance his favorite domestic programs, especially in agriculture, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was willing at one point to risk considerable
       controversy by seeking to cut back investment in defense and, as a corollary of this, to ease
       relations with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s successors are much less willing to provoke controversy,
       more prone to bureaucratic compromise, and less inclined to search for quick and dramatic
       solutions to complex problems. Nevertheless, they too are plagued by disagreements over how
       best to divide the nation's material resources. Thus, they have not as yet been
       able to agree on the final version of the Five-Year Plan for 1966–1970, and they have
       continued to dodge a number of painful decisions simply by assigning high priorities to a
       broad variety of competing goals, including defense, heavy industry, agriculture, and the
        consumer.<note n="3" xml:id="d248fn3">For a more extensive treatment of economic issues and

                        <p>12. Relations between the Soviet military establishment and the political leadership appear
       to have been relatively harmonious in recent years, largely because the politicians have been
       responsive to the opinions and budgetary claims of the military. But the scope of military
       authority in managing the armed forces and the role of professional military opinion in
       framing policy are questions which remain sources of potential discord. There have been
       occasional signs that the <pb n="587" xml:id="pg_587" facs="0615"/>resource allocation issue
       remains a focal point of tension. The current question of the nature and extent of future
       Soviet antiballistic missile (<gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>) deployment, and whether to
       discuss this and other arms control issues with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, seems
       to have led to apprehension within the military and perhaps some dissension within the
       leadership as well.<note n="4" xml:id="d248fn4">For a fuller account of political-military
        relations in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, see <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11–4–67, “Main Trends in Soviet Military Policy,” dated
        20 July 1967, pp. 13–14, Secret. [Footnote in the source text.]</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>13. Concerning specific questions of foreign policy, disagreement within the leadership
       probably tends in the main to focus on particular issues and events as they arise. The
       leadership's handling of the Middle East crisis, for example, was severely
       criticized during the June meeting of the party Central Committee. We do not know whether the
       critic, Nikolai Yegorychev, who subsequently was dismissed from his important party position,
       had charged the senior leadership with failing adequately to support the Arabs, or
       conversely, had complained that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had been
       overextended and overcommitted to the Arab side. Rumors in Moscow at the time suggested the
       former, perhaps because Yegorychev has long been identified with a group in the party which
       seems in general to have favored a harder line both at home and abroad.</p>
                        <p>14. We believe that in Soviet politics there are, in fact, those who normally respond to
       issues as traditionalists, i.e., with ideological rigor and bureaucratic conservatism, and
       others who are willing to stretch doctrine and entertain certain unorthodox departures in
       policy. But we do not think that all Soviet leaders can be placed in one or the other
       category or that such a division reflects so simple a matter as a split between militants and
       moderates.</p>
                        <p>15. Discontent with Soviet actions during the Arab-Israeli war may indeed have been
       strongest among the traditionalists, some of whom apparently fear that a <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-imperialist tide is sweeping over the earth and
       that—as in the Middle East—Soviet policies and Soviet power have been
       inadequate to check or reverse its spread. But the principal architects of Soviet
       policies—the dominant senior group in the Politburo, i.e., <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>,
        <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_SMA1">Suslov</persName>—could by no means be lumped together simply as
       antitraditionalists. Though these four men apparently were united in their determination to
       avoid Soviet embroilment in the Arab-Israeli war, disagreements among them on other issues
       are probably not uncommon. None of these men, however, appears to be an extremist and they
       all seem to be near the middle of the Soviet political spectrum.</p>
                        <p>16. Probably in part because of this, the present Soviet leadership has so far managed to
       avoid the kind of intense debate over policy issues <pb n="588" xml:id="pg_588" facs="0616"/>and maneuvering for political advantage which leads to irreconcilable factionalism and
       wholesale political purge. But the recent reduction of status of Politburo member Aleksandr
       Shelepin and some of his closest followers testified to the continued existence of political
       tension at top levels. And if the economy should once again falter, or if the present
       leadership should encounter serious reverses abroad, the chances would increase of
       intensified quarrels which could bring changes at the top.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Current Issues of Policy</p>
                        <p>17. Like <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and Stalin before them, the
       present leaders would like to see Soviet power and ideology become dominant on a world scale.
       This, at any rate, is a goal which the Soviets continue implicitly to maintain and an
       achievement which they no doubt continue to promise themselves. As a real prospect, however,
       the notion of a worldwide Soviet triumph has long since lost much of its substance and
       virtually all its immediacy. Too many things have happened in recent years—too
       much trouble with the economy, too many rows with the Chinese and within the international
       movement, and too few gains against the West—to permit any responsible Soviet
       leader to view the future with the kind of simplistic optimism once expressed by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                        <p>18. But if the Soviets now understand that there are definite limits to their ability to
       shape and exploit the course of events abroad, they have not as yet shown signs of accepting
       this appreciation gracefully. They sometimes seem most reluctant to match their ambitions to
       their means; old habits and old doctrines apparently die hard in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, as elsewhere. Consequently, Soviet foreign policies now seem to reflect both
       a new sophistication (a more realistic and flexible awareness of national interests) and an
       old simplicity (the dogmatic insistence that the world conform to the Soviet image of it). We
       expect, in general, that this ambivalence will persist for some time and will continue to be
       evident in the way in which the Soviet leaders grapple—or fail to
       grapple—with the international issues certain to confront them.</p>
                        <p>19. <hi rend="italic">Military Policy</hi>. The Soviet leaders have always conceived of
       military power as an essential element of their foreign policy and, since World War II, have
       viewed the balance of forces with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> as a factor of major
       influence on the course of world politics. But the present leaders, while no less concerned
       with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s military posture than their
       predecessors, apparently now recognize that the impressive buildup of Soviet strategic
       strength will not necessarily bring gains in foreign policy. They may already have decided
       that, however essential to national security, the achievement of a rough strategic parity
       with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is unlikely in itself to bring them appreciably
       closer to the fulfillment <pb n="589" xml:id="pg_589" facs="0617"/>of their international
       objectives, and that, especially for their purposes in the Third World, greater attention
       will have to be paid to the development of ground and naval forces.<note n="5" xml:id="d248fn5">Brig. Gen. P. D. Wynne, Jr., for the Assistant Chief of Staff,
        Intelligence, USAF, believes this paragraph seriously underestimates the positive
        relationship between growing Soviet strategic capabilities and the foreign policy of the
         <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and implies a lack of Soviet appreciation for the
        significance in international affairs of a markedly improved Soviet strategic posture. He
        would, therefore, delete the second and third sentences and substitute the following:</note>
       Soviet military leaders have been displaying growing interest in broadening the range of
       Soviet military capabilities, and the leadership as a whole evidently has become increasingly
       concerned with the problems and how best to meet contingencies short of general war.<note n="6" xml:id="d248fn6">See <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11–4–67, “Main
        Trends in Soviet Military Policy,” dated 20 July, pp. 3, 20–21, Secret. [Footnote
        in the source text; see <ref target="#d241">Document 241</ref>.]</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>“The present leaders, no less sensitive than their predecessors to the
       relationship between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s military posture
       and their freedom of action in dealing with the West, apparently recognize that a continuing
       buildup of Soviet strategic strength will support foreign policy objectives. They may already
       have decided that achievement of a credible counterforce, damage-limiting capability against
       the US would be worth the effort in view of the strong backup this would provide for more
       aggressive pursuit of objectives in other areas of the world utilizing specialized ground,
       naval, and tactical air force elements.” [Footnote in the source text.]</p>
                        <p>20. <hi rend="italic">Arms Control</hi>. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> does not
       view arms control as a problem of great urgency. It does see, however, some political profit
       in disarmament negotiations and in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet agreement on
       certain limited forms of control, such as a nuclear nonproliferation treaty. Concerning
       measures which might prove to be politically disadvantageous, the Soviets are likely simply
       to stall or reject. Thus, for example, proposals to restrain the world arms trade are not
       likely to appeal to the Soviets since such trade and aid is clearly regarded in Moscow as the
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s primary political tool in the Third
       World. And concerning measures of greater scope, such as the control of strategic weapons,
       the Soviets are likely to proceed with great caution, suspicion, and reluctance. It is
       possible that they might decide to negotiate about such matters (including the AMB question),
       but for the present we think the chances are slight that they would be willing to agree to
       any comprehensive program of strategic arms control.</p>
                        <p>21. <hi rend="italic">Vietnam</hi>. A prime concern of the Soviet leaders about their
       involvement in the war in Vietnam is simply that they might become embroiled in situations
       which they could not control. Neither the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> nor North
       Vietnam, the principal actors in the conflict, is very susceptible to Soviet influence;
       either of them could behave independently in a way which could test the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s resolve, strain its resources, and risk its
       direct involvement. But, if uncomfortable about the degree of their commitment to an ally
       which has a strong and difficult will of its own <pb n="590" xml:id="pg_590" facs="0618"/>and
       which pursues a cause (control of the South) which is not of vital concern to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, the Soviets nonetheless see no acceptable alternatives to
       their present policies. Almost certainly, they hope Hanoi or Washington, or both, will some
       day make a political solution to the war possible. In the meantime, they will seek to
       persuade the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> not to escalate the conflict any further and
       to agree to terms for a settlement which would be acceptable to North Vietnam. But they will
       probably not try to bring any real pressure on Hanoi to modify its terms for such a
       settlement; they are not anxious to present themselves in the role of an
       “appeaser"—in this way jeopardizing whatever influence they have been
       able to build up—and they are certainly aware that such pressure would probably be
       ineffective in present circumstances.</p>
                        <p>22. <hi rend="italic">China</hi>. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s
       delight at the way China was able to dissipate its resources in the Communist world by
       behaving bizarrely at home seems to have been succeeded by concern over China's
       rabid hostility, bewilderment over the course of events inside China, and apprehension over
       what might happen next. Over the last few years, the Soviets have strengthened their armed
       forces along the Sino-Soviet frontier and in Mongolia and—though probably
       anticipating only border skirmishing—are probably preparing for more serious
       contingencies. But we do not know whether the Soviets have plans for direct intervention in
       China in the event of anarchy or civil war. We believe that the present Soviet leaders, who
       have been relatively restrained in their approach to the Chinese problem to date and who have
       been fairly prudent in their handling of world affairs generally, would seek to avoid direct
       involvement.</p>
                        <p>23. <hi rend="italic">Europe</hi>. The Soviet leaders appear to be convinced that their
       generally conciliatory approach to Western Europe is a promising one and seem to recognize
       that they would have much to lose and little to gain by reverting to a harsher policy. They
       will probably continue for some time their present line of trying to persuade the West
       Europeans that the US is beginning to disengage from Europe and that détente with
       a benevolent Soviet Union is an ever growing possibility. While a formal multilateral
       conference on European security is not likely in the near future, an increase of bilateral
       contacts and negotiations between West European countries and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> seems probable. The Soviets will almost certainly continue publicly to treat
       West Germany as a pariah, but will privately seek to explore the possibility of movement in
       Bonn toward acceptance of the status quo in Germany.</p>
                        <p>24. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s efforts to convince the Eastern
       European States to follow a uniform Soviet-devised foreign policy have encountered resistance
       in recent years, and the Soviets have had to tailor some of their own policies to meet the
       needs of relations between Warsaw Pact States. Soviet tactics in negotiations with the West
       on such issues as nonproliferation <pb n="591" xml:id="pg_591" facs="0619"/>occasionally show
       evidence of delays imposed by consultations and frictions within the Pact. At the same time,
       the Soviets have scored some successes, most notably in slowing down the movement in Eastern
       Europe toward broader and freer contacts with West Germany and other West European States. In
       addition, as a result of the crisis in the Middle East, they have been able to establish
       unusually close rapport with Yugoslavia concerning policies toward the Arab World. But gains
       such as these may prove to be transitory; there appears to be little that Moscow can do to
       prevent the East Europeans from behaving in increasingly independent ways when their national
       interests so dictate. Rumania—which has already formally recognized West Germany
       and which publicly refused to align itself with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
       vis-á-vis the Arab-Israeli war—is by now the classic case in point.</p>
                        <p>25. <hi rend="italic">The Middle East</hi>. In the wake of the Arab-Israeli conflict,
       Moscow appears to be taking stock of its policies in this area. The decisions taken at once
       to start some replacement of military equipment were probably provisional, intended primarily
       as a political holding action and not as an encouragement to continued Arab militancy. But
       the Soviets must recognize that, if they wish to enlarge their influence in the area, an aim
       they are very unlikely to abandon, they have no alternative to continuing to work with the
       radical Arabs. Probably as they move to repair this relationship, they will try hard to gain
       more direct influence over client governments and military establishments. But it is still
       unlikely that they will wish to do this by entering into actual military alliances or
       acquiring military bases in Arab countries. The ambiguities in Soviet-Arab relations will
       remain. Moscow will continue to exploit anti-Western attitudes in Arab countries, but it will
       not run the military risks or accept the political costs of identifying itself with Arab
       aspirations to destroy Israel. It follows also, however, that—barring a major
       change in Arab attitudes—the Soviets will not give very much help to diplomatic
       efforts to move toward a basic settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.<note n="7" xml:id="d248fn7">A long-range view of Soviet policies and aims is contained in <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11–6–67, “Soviet Strategy and Intentions in the

                        <p>26. <hi rend="italic">The Third World</hi>. Partly as a result of their recent experiences
       in the Middle East, the Soviet leaders may have undertaken a new and more searching look at
       their policies in the Third World. Indeed, there may be considerable discontent with the
       commitment of Soviet resources and prestige to clients whose interest may be essentially
       different from those of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and whose conduct can be
       both unpredictable <pb n="592" xml:id="pg_592" facs="0620"/>and uncontrollable. Some may
       argue that more caution should be exercised in involving Soviet policy with the great variety
       of so-called “national liberation” forces in the Third World. The
       question has probably arisen as to what degree of risk—military and
       political—to assume in honoring Soviet commitments, or what Soviet clients may
       think are commitments. But, even if such questions are under review, it seems very unlikely
       to us that the Soviet leaders would as a consequence make any very dramatic changes in
       policy. Any abrupt cutback in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s material
       support of and political relationships with the Third World would jeopardize the heavy
       investment already made. Moreover, the Soviet leaders are almost certainly convinced that, as
       a great power, the USSR has a legitimate interest in practically all areas of the world and a
       political need to assert that interest.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that he thought we were all set on
       Mt. Alto as the location to be offered to the Soviet Embassy as part of the projected
       exchange of chancery sites. We would now need from the Soviet side a statement, either oral
       or written, that this was agreeable to them. He asked whether Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> was familiar with the September 28 Cleveland Park
       Citizens Association resolution on Tregaron. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he was not fully informed, but he had seen an article in the
       Washington Star which had stated that Tregaron was again in the picture. The article had also
       mentioned that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJJ1">Rooney</persName> was opposed to it but that
       the Cleveland Park Citizens Association had voted in favor.<note n="2" xml:id="d249fn2">The
        article, “Tregaron a Dark Horse for Russian Embassy,” appeared in the
        October 1 issue, p. B–2; Congressman <persName corresp="#p_RJJ1">John J. Rooney</persName>
        (D-New York) opposed the site.</note>

                        <pb n="593" xml:id="pg_593" facs="0621"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that, for the
       Ambassador's private information, it was true that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJJ1">Rooney</persName> lives in the area and is opposed to having any embassies in that
       neighborhood. He then described the two main points of the recently passed Cleveland Park
       Citizens Association resolution: (1) that the U.S. Government could acquire the entire
       property, but (2) that the Government would be expected to make half of the property along
       the north side into a park. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said in our
       view the Tregaron proposal complicates the whole chancery site picture, and we might be faced
       with long additional delays if we proceeded along those lines. He said we would like to have
       from the Ambassador a statement that the Soviet side was satisfied with Mt. Alto and indeed
       preferred it, since only half of the Tregaron property would be available under the Citizens
       Association resolution.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that, in view of what Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> had said, he was prepared to give his
       immediate agreement to Mt. Alto. He said he was most anxious to have the matter of chancery
       sites settled. He asked what other steps would now be necessary. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said he thought we could proceed quite rapidly now. We
       would make arrangements to have the General Services Administration transfer the Mt. Alto
       property to the Department for the purpose of making available a chancery site for the Soviet
       Embassy, in exchange for comparable property to be made available to us in Moscow. Following
       that we would be prepared to have an exchange of notes for a formal agreement.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked whether there was any
       precedent for this kind of exchange. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said
       there was not, and therefore we could proceed in the way that seemed best. For example, we
       might agree to leases of 99 years or an indefinite period. The important thing was for both
       sides to be satisfied. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked, in
       looking ahead to the building stage, whether the Soviets would deal with the State Department
       regarding the buildings' appearance, specifications, etc., or with some other
       government agency. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said he thought they
       would deal with the city on that matter. He assumed the Soviets would perhaps wish to hire a
       contractor here, as well as bringing in their own people. Approval of the city authorities
       would be needed for various things, but he anticipated no problems.</p>
                        <p>In concluding their discussion of Mt. Alto Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> reaffirmed that
       agreement had been reached in principle on the question of exchange sites.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that, if queried by the press or others, the Embassy would state that
       it had opted for the Mt. Alto site.</p>

                        <p>1443. 1. Deputy Minister <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Vinogradov</persName> called me to
       Foreign Office this morning with <persName corresp="#p_KGM1">Kornienko</persName> present and
       made the following oral statement, copy of which he gave me for my convenience:
       “As is well known, for over four years American authorities have been preventing
       departure from the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> of Soviet citizen Imamv Ivanov.<note n="2" xml:id="d250fn2">See <ref target="#d207fn4">footnote 4, Document 207</ref>.</note>
       Soviet Government has repeatedly, including during discussions between <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> Foreign Minister and <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
       Secretary of State Dean Rusk, raised with American side question of his departure from <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. In February 1967, appropriate request was sent by <persName corresp="#p_IIA1">Ivanov</persName>'s parents, people of very advanced age,
       directly to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> President. However, American officials,
       referring to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government's inability interfere in
       any way in judicial process until hearing of Ivanov's case in appellate court,
       have thus far refrained from taking steps for positive solution this question. On October 6,
       1967, decision by appellate court was made and it was negative for Ivanov. In view of this, I
       have been instructed once again to draw attention of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
       Government to fact that continuing detention in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> of Soviet
       citizen <persName corresp="#p_IIA1">Ivanov</persName> is additional element complicating
       Soviet-American relations, which anyway leave much to be desired. Soviet Government counts
       upon <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government taking steps in nearest future for positive
       solution of question regarding <persName corresp="#p_IIA1">Ivanov</persName>'s
       departure for his homeland the Soviet Union.”</p>
                        <p>2. I said I understood there was a possibility of a further appeal and inquired whether it
       was intended such an appeal be made. <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Vinogradov</persName> said
       he understood that they had thirty days from October 6 in which to make an appeal and that
       this would be done if <persName corresp="#p_IIA1">Ivanov</persName> was not earlier released.
        <persName corresp="#p_KGM1">Kornienko</persName> pointed out that the State Department had
       taken the position that we could not intervene while an appeal in the courts was pending. I
       said I would promptly inform the Department of his statement.</p>
                        <p>3. I believe we could get considerable mileage from the release and deportation of Ivanov
       at this time and strongly recommend that we do so. The long freeze in the development of
       Soviet foreign policy due to the 50th anniversary celebrations will soon be ended and from
       all indications there is a close balance in the leadership as to the direction such policies
       should take. Our favorable action in this case could <pb n="595" xml:id="pg_595" facs="0623"/>have an effect far beyond that which would normally result from a gesture of this
        kind.<note n="3" xml:id="d250fn3">In telegram 57130 to Moscow, October 20, the Department of
        State replied, noting that it was considering the recommendation but wanted to avoid the
        erroneous impression that <persName corresp="#p_IIA1">Ivanov</persName>'s release
        was part of a trade, for example for the release of Stephen Zipper, a U.S. citizen arrested
        by the Soviets in late September 1967 and detained on drug-smuggling charges. (National

                        <p>In a letter to President Johnson dated October 20, 1967, Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> called for “resolute steps”
       toward a political settlement in the Middle East. The President replied in an October 23
       letter to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. On October 24 Soviet Ambassador
        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> presented an oral message, supplementing
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s October 20 letter, that proposed
       a confidential exchange of views on the Middle East. The texts of these messages are
       scheduled for publication in <ref target="frus1964-68v19">

                        <p>As the Attorney General was aware the Soviets had made clear by their behavior over the
       past three years that they attached considerable importance to <persName corresp="#p_IIA1">Ivanov</persName>. This had been reflected by several attempts to lay hands on possible
       hostages in the Soviet Union—e.g., Barghoorn in 1963<note n="2" xml:id="d252fn2">See <ref target="frus1961-63v05#d372">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1961–1963, vol. V, Documents 372</ref>, <ref target="frus1961-63v05#d374">374</ref>, and <ref target="frus1961-63v05#d376">376</ref>.</note> and more recently Wortham and Gilmour,<note n="3" xml:id="d252fn3">See
         <ref target="#d190fn2">footnote 2, Document 190</ref>.</note> and by high level appeals for
       clemency both in Moscow and in Washington. (In response to the Attorney General's
       query as to why the Soviets attach so much importance to <persName corresp="#p_IIA1">Ivanov</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that because
       attention had been given the case at the highest levels he could only assume that more was at
       stake than simply the morale of the Soviet espionage services; he suspected that there was a
       family connection between <persName corresp="#p_IIA1">Ivanov</persName> and high officials in
       the Soviet Government.) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that the
       Secretary of State was aware of the difficulties that the Justice Department would face in
       considering any recommendation for Executive clemency in the Ivanov case, and it was for this
       reason that the Secretary had asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> to
       raise the problem personally with the Attorney General. The Secretary had discussed the
       question with the President and <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName> was aware
       that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> was raising the matter with the
       Attorney General today. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> then reviewed the
       case for clemency along the lines of the attached Talking Paper,<note n="4" xml:id="d252fn4">Not printed.</note> a copy of which he left with the Attorney General. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> told the Attorney General that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had renewed the Soviet appeal for clemency with him at
       lunch yesterday and that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had been told that
       while the question would be discussed with the Department of <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0625"/>Justice Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> was not in a position
       to make any commitment of any kind at this stage. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> then read to the Attorney General a full account of his conversation on
       this subject with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General said that he had not had an opportunity to examine the <persName corresp="#p_IIA1">Ivanov</persName> file in detail but was of course aware of the case and
       of the Soviet interest in bringing about <persName corresp="#p_IIA1">Ivanov</persName>'s release. He would now examine the problem carefully, consult
       with his associates and be in touch with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> at an early date. Meanwhile, he would like to explain in general terms
       the difficulties which he foresaw in supporting a recommendation for Executive clemency. In
       the first place, as a law enforcement officer he was conscious of the need to do nothing
       which would downgrade the vital nature of the responsibilities carried out by officials in
       his Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in protecting the security of the
       United States. Seizure and conviction of a foreign espionage agent is a rare occurrence, and
       release of a convicted spy without an adequate quid pro quo could be detrimental to the
       morale of law enforcement officers. Exchange of a Soviet espionage agent for one of our own
       was entirely defensible; but unilateral release of a convicted spy was quite another
       development which would be difficult for law enforcement officers to understand and support.
       Secondly, we had to look at the problem from the standpoint of deterrence. If the Soviets
       felt that their agents caught in the act of espionage would ultimately be released and would
       not have to serve the full penalty for their acts, seizure and conviction would not serve as
       substantial deterrence. The Attorney General, of course, recognized that Soviet espionage
       activities in the United States and elsewhere did not depend exclusively on efforts by their
       own nationals; they had a wide network of agents to draw upon. Thirdly, clemency for
        <persName corresp="#p_IIA1">Ivanov</persName> could generate an impression with the American
       public that the principle of law enforcement was to be applied in a different way when
       diplomatic considerations were involved. Finally, and related to the third factor, was the
       problem of domestic political considerations. The Attorney General wondered how clemency for
       Ivanov could be explained to the public, to the press, and the Congress.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that both the Secretary and others
       concerned with the problem in the Department were keenly aware of the difficulties cited by
       the Attorney General which must be faced in reaching a decision. Obviously we would have to
       give careful thought to a rationale for use in dealing particularly with the Congress, and on
       a background basis with the press, for clemency in the case of <persName corresp="#p_IIA1">Ivanov</persName>. Perhaps the best approach to this problem would be to describe the act
       as a gesture of goodwill toward the Soviet Union with the aim of removing a serious irritant
       in our bilateral relations and with the hope that this would influence Soviet decision making
       in a direction favorable to us.</p>
                        <pb n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0626"/>
                        <p>The Attorney General asked whether the matter was urgent. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> pointed out that the question of appeal to the Supreme Court was now
       pending and it would be desirable to have a decision on the question of clemency before the
       appeal must be filed. Mr. Yeagley pointed out that he understood that Mr. Edward Bennett
       Williams, whose services the Soviets had recently engaged in the <persName corresp="#p_IIA1">Ivanov</persName> case, had requested a stay until December 5 in which to file a petition
       for a writ of certiorari. It was agreed that we should aim for a decision on clemency before
       the expiry of the stay. The Attorney General commented that the fact that Williams had taken
       on the case could have ominous overtones; Williams was not the sort of lawyer to take on a
       loser.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that the Attorney General would be in touch with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> or Mr. Yeagley with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Toon</persName> when the Justice Department had had an opportunity to examine the problem
       in the light of this discussion. Meanwhile, Mr. Yeagley would be provided with a list of
       cases involving detention and/or conviction of American and Soviet nationals in recent years
       and the way in which these cases have been disposed of.<note n="5" xml:id="d252fn5">During a
        meeting with <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> on November 29, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> again raised the issue of releasing Ivanov and,
        “saying he was speaking personally, then stressed that this case was of
        importance in Soviet-American relations far beyond its intrinsic importance. Whatever the
        'Special Services' might think about it, he was sure that the
        detention of <persName corresp="#p_IIA1">Ivanov</persName> influenced negatively decisions
        in completely unrelated fields of real importance to the Soviet-American
        relationship.” (Memorandum of conversation; Department of State, <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> Files: Lot 71 D 460, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> Memoranda of

                        <p>1755. Subj: Shifting Balance of Power in Soviet Leadership.</p>
                        <p>1. Perhaps the most significant development during the week-long 50th anniversary
       festivities was the conduct of the Soviet leadership itself and the implications of this
       conduct for developments within the hierarchical structure.</p>
                        <pb n="599" xml:id="pg_599" facs="0627"/>
                        <p>2. Obvious efforts were made during jubilee to perpetuate the public image of the <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>-Podgornyy troika. However, after all was said and done it was <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> who emerged more obviously than ever before as the
       primus inter pares in the present political constellation.</p>
                        <p>3. It was he who clearly dominated the festivities. He dedicated Lenin statue in Kremlin
       November 2; made the major addresses at sessions in Moscow November 3–4 and in Leningrad
       November 5; and acted as principal host and speaker at Kremlin reception following November 7
       parade. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s role was limited to
       chairing part of November 4 Moscow joint session; addressing the Moscow organizations at
       awards meeting November 6; and delivering “short” toast at Kremlin
       reception. <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName>'s contributions about
       matched <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s, with former chairing
       opening of joint session November 3 and presenting awards in both Leningrad and Moscow.</p>
                        <p>4. Deferential reference to troika members in speeches of lesser leaders were interesting.
        <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> and several others referred by name to
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName> in their “official roles,” but that was all. In
       fairly sharp contrast all republic first secretaries at joint meeting in Moscow voiced
       explicit approval of <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s report
       although some endorsements evidently considered too personally laudatory and so were not
       carried subsequently in central press. Perhaps one of more interesting performances in this
       connection was Marshal Grechko's at the November 7 Kremlin reception where in
       homage to <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> he noted the “daily
       leadership” of armed forces by CC <gloss target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss> and
       Politburo and toasted “CC <gloss target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss>, Politburo and
       General Secretary CC <gloss target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev</persName>.”</p>
                        <p>5. Also were especially struck by minimal attention of speakers during talkathon to
       principle of “collective leadership.” While <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> pledged continuation and strengthening of principle once briefly and in
       passing, no other speaker touched this point which had been hallmark this
       leadership's pronouncements starting with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s ouster.</p>
                        <p>6. How much <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s public preeminence
       reflects accretion personal power and how much attributable his institutional role on what
       was primarily a party holiday may be debatable. Nonetheless, his conspicuous over-shadowing
       of other members of leadership troika was so marked as to raise questions about future
       leadership balance.</p>
                        <p>7. In this context, the differences in tenor and content <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s two speeches in Moldavia (Moscow 1334 and 1369)<note n="2" xml:id="d253fn2">Dated October 4 and 7, respectively. (Ibid., POL 7 <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>)</note> and Polyansky's <pb n="600" xml:id="pg_600" facs="0628"/>article in “Kommunist” (Moscow 1578)<note n="3" xml:id="d253fn3">Dated October 26. (Ibid., E 5 <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>/Five Year)</note> take
       on more interesting overtones. This particularly so since <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> in his marathon address seemed to endorse Polyansky's
       exposition and then go one step further to demonstrate close sympathy with military on
       assessment defense needs, securing in process Grechko's personal public
       tribute—an endorsement suggesting a close developing relationship between General
       Secretary and armed forces leadership.</p>
                        <p>8. It probably still premature to suggest that <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s leadership is unquestioned or that his views necessarily
       carry the day. By same token, however, it is difficult to ignore public personality play of
       last few days and implications it may have for changes in leadership.</p>
                        <p>9. Polyansky's star appears to be rising and his portrait was the only one,
       apart from the troika, in front ranks not in alphabetical order in the main parade of
       pictures carried through Red Square on the seventh.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> has at times appeared tired and his poor
       health and death of his wife have doubtless affected him. (For what it may be worth British
       Ambassador's barber said <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> spent
       large part of his summer holiday in heart clinic.) We have heard repeated reports that he has
       offered to resign.</p>
                        <p>11. Despite <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s preeminence, he
       has not succeeded in establishing his image as the leader and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> appears to be much more respected by the public. I suspect also that
       even in party circles, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> by sheer ability has
       influence comparable to that of <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>, at least in
       his own field.</p>
                        <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName> appears to be ambitious but limited in
       ability. Should <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> resign, he or Polyanskiy would
       appear to be the most likely successors. On the other hand, if there should be a Kremlin
       coup, <persName corresp="#p_SAN1">Shelepin</persName> would be the most likely to lead it and
        <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName> the most likely to be dropped.</p>
                        <p>13. I must point out that these views are highly speculative as we have little to go on. I
       am encouraged to submit them by the fact that I have recently had occasion to ascertain that
       they coincide not only with those of a number of my colleagues but also of the few Russians
       who have been willing to talk about such matters. It is a game that anyone can play.</p>

                        <p>74809. Eyes Only for Ambassador From Secretary. Now that the Fiftieth Anniversary is behind
       us and we had a unanimous vote on the Middle East resolution in the Security Council, I will
       pass along my own thoughts regarding your 1389 of October 9.<note n="2" xml:id="d254fn2">Telegram 1389 from Moscow reported that during a talk with <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> on October 9 <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> referred
        to a discussion with <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> in late September during
        which the Secretary raised the possibility of an understanding that there would be no border
        changes in Asia without the agreement of the U.S. and Soviet Governments and that the
        problem of divided countries should be solved gradually by the wishes of their peoples.
         <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked that <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> be more specific about what he had in mind. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and I, in our talks in New York, were
       getting close to the edge of talking about China and the general situation in Asia. I told
       him that I thought that there were important elements in the Asian situation in which the
       interests of the Soviet Union and the United States might coincide. I said, as an example,
       that the United States could proceed on the basis that—</p>
                        <p>(a) The present frontiers in Asia should be looked upon as permanent.</p>
                        <p>(b) If there are border disputes we would be prepared to lend assistance in a peaceful
       resolution of such disputes. (I had in mind such a border as the McMahon line between India
       and China.)</p>
                        <p>(c) If there are problems of demarcation, we would be ready to be of assistance in
       demarcation. (I had in mind the borders of Cambodia.)</p>
                        <p>(d) In the event of divided states such as Korea and Viet-Nam the issue should be resolved
       by peaceful means and not by force.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that these four points were a basis
       for a genuine common interest between the United States and the Soviet Union. I
       don't recall that I told him, but I had in mind that point (d) might work to the
       advantage of the United States in its short-run in such situations as Viet-Nam but that the
       Soviet Union might be much interested in point (a)—given the longer range
       prospects of their problems with a billion Chinese.</p>
                        <p>I specifically did not propose any “form of understanding” and do not
       do so now. It might be no more than a basis for some further conversation between us. Nor was
       I attempting to find a formula which <pb n="602" xml:id="pg_602" facs="0630"/>might be simply
       a temporary convenience with regard to Viet-Nam from our point of view. I was letting my mind
       range far ahead to the long term complex of Asian problems over the next ten or twenty
       years.</p>
                        <p>I would suggest that, in mentioning the matter again to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, you tell him that I was thinking in the broadest and longest range
       terms about the situation in Asia and how the state interests of the Soviet Union and the
       United States would fit into that situation. You might add that I have been trying to analyze
       the uncertainties of the next decades in Asia and have been trying to identify those points
       of common interest between the Soviet Union and the United States which might be genuine
       common interests. Obviously, the identification of such common interests on such important
       matters could be important for the two countries on whom fall so much responsibility for the
       maintenance of peace.</p>
                        <p>As a postscript, I departed from my traditional practice and attended the Fiftieth
       Anniversary Reception at the Soviet Embassy in Washington. I did so for a very simple reason:
       We have had fifty years of coexistence as between the Soviet Union and the United States (in
       the sense that we have not had a major war with each other), and I would be glad to have
       another fifty years about which one could say the same thing.<note n="3" xml:id="d254fn3">

                        </list>
                        <p>In response to the President's request of this morning, the following are my
       thoughts on the subject:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Chances of Chinese Involvement</p>
                        <p>1. Although the Chinese do not wish to become involved, the likelihood of Chinese
       involvement will grow as the light at the end of tunnel begins to be brighter.</p>
                        <p>2. The Chinese wish the war to go on as long as possible: it ties down both the United
       States and the Soviet Union, while also increasing US-Soviet animosity. Moreover, stability
       in Southeast Asia, achieved essentially through a successful US policy, is the last thing
       they want.</p>
                        <p>3. In the event of a settlement or simply the gradual fading of hostilities, some internal
       conflict in the Hanoi leadership is to be expected. The more militant faction may see no
       choice but to invite Chinese assistance. To assume that no North Vietnamese would ever call
       for Chinese aid is to underestimate the degree of ideological fervor and anti-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> hostility that today exists in Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>4. Either responding to such a call, or even on their own initiative, the Chinese may feel
       that the gradual introduction of limited forces either into Laos or the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> would be sufficient to bolster sagging North Vietnamese morale
       and to perpetuate the conflict, without risking excessive <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
       response. To the Chinese, both the Korean War and the very measured character of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> escalation against North Vietnam provide psychological assurance
       that the likely <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> response to initially limited Chinese
       involvement would be measured and tempered.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. The Soviet Attitude towards the Vietnamese War</p>
                        <p>1. At first, the Soviet leaders were concerned that the war may complicate the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relationship or prompt unacceptable risks. This fear is
       probably much less today than a year or so ago.</p>
                        <pb n="604" xml:id="pg_604" facs="0632"/>
                        <p>2. As the war went on, the Soviet leaders began to see some major benefits themselves from
       the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> involvement. In their thinking:</p>
                        <p>a. The war weakened <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> posture in Europe and created new
       openings for Soviet diplomacy;</p>
                        <p>b. it reduced the effectiveness of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> bridge-building to
       East Europe;</p>
                        <p>c. it intensified domestic strains in the United States while consuming major <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> resources;</p>
                        <p>d. it diverted Chinese hostility from the Soviet Union and reduced the likelihood of a
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Chinese rapprochement.</p>
                        <p>3. Without a doubt the war also has created liabilities for the Soviet Union. The Soviets
       have been embarrassed by their inability to deter the US from bombing a Communist state. The
       war did reduce the possibility of increased US-Soviet trade, which at least some Soviet
       leaders desired. Nonetheless, the assumed political benefits of the war certainly must
       outweigh in the minds of most Soviet leaders the loss of somewhat marginal and essentially
       only potential economic benefits.</p>
                        <p>4. It would appear that today the Soviet leaders are primarily concerned with containing
       the risks of the war; not with the war itself. Furthermore, if one bears in mind the over-all
       Soviet view of their relationship with the United States—including the allegedly
       more “aggressive” <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
       policy—it is difficult to see why the Soviet leaders should not view the war as,
       on balance, convenient, though posing certain obvious risks. A prolonged and painful
       continuation is preferable either to a <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> victory or even to a
       compromise settlement, which would simply free the United States to pursue more effectively
       its policies in Asia or Europe. Prolonging the war but minimizing its risks—that
       in essence appears to be the Soviet posture in regard to the Vietnamese conflict.<note n="2" xml:id="d255fn2">On December 12 Brezezinski completed a 71-page paper entitled
        “The Soviet Union and the United States” that analyzed the state of
        Soviet policy toward the United States and, on that basis, developed some propositions
        concerning the probable trends in the U.S.-Soviet relationship and some implications for
        U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union. A notation on the paper indicates that <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> saw it. Henry Owen, Chairman of the Policy Planning
        Council, forwarded it to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> under a December 15
        covering memorandum that recommended <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> meet with
        the Policy Planning Council and other senior Department officers to discuss the paper.
         <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> approved the proposal but no record of a meeting

                        </list>
                        <p>1. The Embassy's reporting is entirely satisfactory in quantity, quality and
       timeliness. We rarely differ with the Embassy in the interpretation of either internal or
       external developments. The Embassy's Soviet contacts—naturally, always
       small in number and a dubious lot on political questions—have, over the years,
       been a valuable source of information on the cultural and intellectual milieu. The Embassy is
       also well tied into the Moscow diplomatic and foreign correspondent informational
       network.</p>
                        <p>2. It is disappointing, but not at all surprising given the state of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations, that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> has been unable to reestablish the direct, personal links with the
       Soviet hierarchy he had in his previous tour in <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s hey-day. He is, of course, an old Soviet hand and has
       few peers in his experience of Soviet diplomacy. He has always been, however, more the
       practical diplomat than the thoughtful student of Soviet affairs. His personal communications
       to Washington are often cryptic and prosaic. In addition, he has a reputation for being
       circumspect and unusually close-mouthed in matters he considers diplomatically sensitive and
       it is thought in the State Department that in such instances he often resorts to private,
       exclusive communications.</p>

                        <p>An assessment of relative military capabilities is exceedingly complex, uncertain, and
       controversial. It is complex because so many variables enter into the assessment of military
       capabilities and because military technology is advancing so rapidly and on so many fronts.
       Even for the present, many of these variables are subject to wide ranges of estimates (e.g.,
       How hard are missile silos? How accurate are missiles? What is the actual operational
       reliability of weapons systems?). Intelligence estimates have not proven fully reliable in
       the past. In the future, the variations of these estimates may be even greater because it is
       inherently more difficult to obtain reliable information on qualitative changes of the type
       expected.</p>
                        <p>The present study confirms the fact that there are great and honest differences of opinion
       among knowledgeable experts, particularly as to the future relationship of strategic forces.
       “The truth” is elusive partly because our information cannot be
       complete, and partly because the relevant indicators of military capability depend on what
       you are trying to measure. Unquestionably the same uncertainties exist for the Soviet Union.
       Thus, categorical statements (including our own) about strategic relations, particularly
       projections more than five years into the future, should be treated with considerable
       skepticism.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Findings on the Strategic Balance (Details at Tab A)<note n="2" xml:id="d258fn2">The tabs were not attached.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">During the past three years, the Soviets have substantially increased
        their ability to damage the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in a nuclear exchange</hi>.
       Our ability to limit damage to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> has been correspondingly
       reduced. Their rapid <pb n="608" xml:id="pg_608" facs="0636"/>buildup of hardened, dispersed
        <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s has given them a deterrent in which they should have
       high confidence. In a second strike, we estimate they could inflict two to four times more
       damage on the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> today than they could in early 1965 (80–100
       million fatalities as compared to 25–35 million). The Soviet leaders certainly are aware that
       their situation has improved, even though their detailed calculations may differ from
       ours.</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Perceptions of the strategic balance are probably more significant in
        international relations than the actual balance</hi>. Our own perceptions of the balance may
       not have changed as markedly as the above facts suggest. This is best assessed by our own
       leadership. However, it should be noted that, in the early 1960's, we already had
       credited the Soviets with the ability to do substantial damage to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, and we foresaw the emergence of mutual deterrence by mid-decade. On the other
       hand, the Soviets undoubtedly had a feeling of strategic inferiority in the early
       1960's which must have declined today.</p>
                        <p>c. <hi rend="italic">Over the next decade, we expect the Soviets to continue expansion of
        their strategic forces and even to surpass us in some categories of strategic strength</hi>.
       They will equal the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in the number of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launchers deployed during the coming year and will probably
       continue to expand their force beyond 1000 missiles. Several Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s with advanced performance characteristics now are in development. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> also will pass us in total intercontinental megatonnage in
       1968 or 1969. They could equal or surpass us in numbers of Polaris-type submarines in the
       mid-1970's. They already have an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system in the
       Moscow area, and it seems likely they will deploy <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s more
       widely in the 1970's.</p>
                        <p>d. <hi rend="italic">These trends do not now jeopardize the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> deterrent, nor do they seem likely to do so in the next five years or so</hi>.
       We believe that the Secretary of Defense makes a persuasive case that our deterrent will
       remain more than adequate even against quite unlikely increases in the threat. However, we
       should point out that some qualified military experts question this conclusion. At present,
       our principal means of assuring deterrence into the 1970's is the MIRV <note n="3" xml:id="d258fn3">Multiple, independently-targeted re-entry vehicles. [Footnote in the source
        text.]</note> program. MIRVs will increase our total number of warheads from about [less
       than 1 line of source text not declassified] today to [less than 1 line of source text not
       declassified] in 1976, with the increase beginning in 1970. However, between now and 1970 the
       Soviets could come close to parity in total intercontinental warheads.</p>
                        <p>e. <hi rend="italic">The Soviets also have been gradually increasing the reach of their
        conventional military forces</hi>. In recent years they have developed forces which, while
       probably originally intended for the general war mission, <pb n="609" xml:id="pg_609" facs="0637"/>now provide them with capabilities for distant, limited operations. Specific
       evidence of growing Soviet military reach includes: greater worldwide naval activity,
       particularly in the Mediterranean; the expansion and modernization of airlift and sealift
       capabilities; and a modest expansion of naval infantry (marines). The Yemen provides evidence
       of Soviet willingness already to exercise their growing reach. We foresee a doubling of
       port-to-port sealift capabilities over the next decade and a substantial increase in their
       airlift. However, the Soviets will remain far behind the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in
       their over-all capability to move large forces rapidly to distant points and will have less
       capacity for opposed operations beyond the range of their tactical aircraft.</p>
                        <p>f. <hi rend="italic">The Soviets have maintained superiority in Central Europe and have
        modernized their forces, including the provision of a formidable tactical nuclear
        capability</hi>. However, since the early 1960's, our own assessments have
       recognized that the margin of their conventional superiority is much less than we previously
       assumed, particularly in a surprise attack. Furthermore, the consensus in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is that a Soviet attack on Western Europe is highly
       unlikely.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Political Implications (Details at Tabs B and C)</p>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">The current rapid growth in Soviet strategic nuclear forces is
        unlikely to increase their willingness to take actions which they believe would have a high
        risk of leading to nuclear war with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> either directly or
        by escalation</hi>. For in contemplating the possible consequences of any such course, their
       own casualties would still be likely to weigh more heavily upon Soviet calculations than
       their growing ability to hurt us. Such restraint, however, does not rule out Soviet
       initiatives that could adversely affect the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> or its
       allies' interests. Where a direct conflict of interests develops, Soviet leaders
       may prove tougher in maintaining their positions in a situation of mutual deterrence.</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">We should be concerned that, as the Soviets view their higher
        strategic force levels as reinforcing deterrence, they may be more inclined to think they
        can intervene in third areas with reduced risk of American opposition</hi>. Potential Soviet
       options for such moves are created by the greater reach of their conventional forces. As a
       result, they may be more tempted to respond to requests for military support from governments
       or factions they support politically. Thus, we could be faced with situations in which the
       Soviets intervene before we do, leaving us with the choice of initiating confrontation or
       accepting a fait accompli.</p>
                        <p>c. <hi rend="italic">While the basic condition of deterrence is not likely to be upset in
        the next five years, any close reckoning of the state of the strategic balance will be
        increasingly complex and difficult</hi>. In particular, net evaluations are becoming more
       and more sensitive to assumptions about weapons characteristics, such as accuracy, which are
       extremely difficult to verify. Traditional <pb n="610" xml:id="pg_610" facs="0638"/>“box score” comparisons of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet
       strength relations are becoming increasingly subject to varied interpretations and possible
       manipulation for polemical purposes both by domestic critics of our defense programs and by
       the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>d. <hi rend="italic">Domestic American controversy over defense policy is likely to
        increase, inevitably attracting foreign attention</hi>. So far, foreign reaction to changing
       Soviet capabilities has been limited, but American discussion will expose foreign opinion to
       criticism of American policy on two lines—one that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> programs are pushing the Soviets into a new round in the arms race and the other
       that American vulnerability is increasing and that American ability to meet its Alliance
       commitments is declining. Either line of criticism could, if it makes an impact abroad,
       complicate our foreign relations.</p>
                        <p>e. <hi rend="italic">Uncertainties will tend to generate mutually reinforcing pressures on
        both sides to use “worst case” assumptions</hi>. For the Soviets, this
       will mean having to adopt military budgets which entail a cost in over-all economic growth
       rates. Moscow may seek ways of regulating the pace of the arms race, perhaps using arms talks
       and even limited arms control agreements for this purpose. There appears, however, to be very
       little likelihood that the two sides will be able to attune their views on all the complex
       issues sufficiently to conclude a comprehensive agreement to end the race in strategic
       weaponry.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Conclusions</p>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">Mutual deterrence is here and likely to persist for at least the next
        decade</hi>. In these circumstances the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> will have
       increasing difficulty in defining vital interests for which the use of nuclear weapons would
       be warranted. Moreover, even to maintain deterrence we will have to continue spending large
       sums because of the uncertainties inherent in the strategic equation and the steady
       development of new weapons systems.</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Effect on the Soviet Union</hi>—The Soviets probably
       believe that their growing strategic capabilities will deter the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, enhance their prestige, and improve their ability to influence events in other
       countries. The Soviets may be more prone to take advantage of opportunities to intervene in
       local conflicts or may be more readily drawn into such conflicts and, once involved, may be
       less willing to withdraw. Thus, we may face situations where the Soviets are there first or
       where it will be desirable for the US to intervene rapidly to assure they are not. At
       present, this seems most likely to occur in the Middle East or Africa.</p>
                        <p>c. <hi rend="italic">Effect on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
        Allies—Soviet military capabilities in Europe will remain at least as great as
        heretofore</hi>. From a military viewpoint, Soviet leaders will certainly feel as able as
       they have been in the past to engage <pb n="611" xml:id="pg_611" facs="0639"/>in a policy of
       threats or renewal of pressures on Berlin. Their increased over-all power may cause our
       European allies to be more deferential to Soviet political pressures and lead to questioning
       of the reliability of American commitments. The confidence of the European members of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> nuclear intervention in
       the event of an attack on Europe already has declined and probably will be further eroded.
       While the Europeans already understand in general terms that mutual deterrence exists, they
       have been slow to acknowledge the full meaning for them. Where they have recognized the
       implications, with the exception of France, they have chosen to play them down. To be sure, a
       significant deterrent to an attack on Europe will remain so long as the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> retains a nuclear arsenal. However, continued concern about the
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> nuclear guarantee and demands for reassurance are likely
       to be prominent in our future relations with the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
       countries. If our allies feel these concerns are not being met, it could lead either to
       neutralism or to greater pressures for independent nuclear capabilities.</p>
                        <p>d. <hi rend="italic">Non-Proliferation</hi>—Questions about the validity of the
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> deterrent in protecting other countries could feed
       pressures for additional independent nuclear capabilities—and not only in Europe.
       We are likely to encounter increasing pressures for more specific assurances as to our
       nuclear commitments at a time when the strategic situation and the mood of the American
       public make it less likely that we will be able to accede to these pressures.</p>
                        <p>Given our own obvious vulnerability to nuclear attack, it will be more difficult for the
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to extend nuclear assurances, and it may also become
       increasingly difficult for us to satisfy other countries that their security requirements can
       be met through nuclear guarantees. (The light <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense
       should help, at least for some years, to reinforce our assurances to Asian countries that
       feel threatened by Communist China.) Under these conditions, there may be greater pressures
       for independent nuclear capabilities. Our efforts to resist such pressures are likely to
       increase strains in our relationships with friendly countries.</p>
                        <p>e. <hi rend="italic">Limiting Strategic Forces</hi>—In current circumstances the
       reasonable approach would be for both sides to seek to limit their expenditures on strategic
       forces. However, the prospects for limiting strategic forces by agreement with the Soviets
       are not promising. The difficulties have been noted above, particularly the difficulty of
       controlling technology. However, the effort to achieve such an understanding should not be
       abandoned. If, as seems likely, a situation of mutual deterrence is destined to persist for
       some years, both sides may become convinced that they should try to maintain deterrence at
       lower levels of effort. Two possible approaches with respect to the Soviets have been
       advocated in recent years: (a) one stresses our ability to maintain superiority and the
       futility of their competing with us; (b) an alternative <pb n="612" xml:id="pg_612" facs="0640"/>approach accepts approximate parity as inevitable and seeks specific means of
       implementing it through discussion, and, hopefully, agreement. Past <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> public statements of defense policy have stressed elements of both approaches.
       In our view, it is preferable to avoid the rhetoric of both
       “superiority” and of “parity.” Rather, our
       statements should stress the adequacy or sufficiency of our deterrent and make the point that
       we are doing just as much as is necessary to assure our deterrent. We are not attempting to
       accelerate the arms race by doing more nor jeopardizing security by doing less.</p>
                        <p>f. <hi rend="italic">Offense-Defense Balance</hi>—A major asymmetry exists
       between the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Soviet strategies and strategic postures.
       This is the difference in relative emphasis which we and they place on strategic defense. In
       recent years, <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy statements have given increasing
       weight to “assured destruction” and lesser weight to “damage
       limitation.” This trend has certain foreign policy implications.</p>
                        <p>First, the Soviets see us as “offense-oriented.” Almost certainly
       they will perceive the sharp increases in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> offensive
       warheads which will result from our MIRV program as a serious threat to them. This Soviet
       view contributes both to the maintenance of political tensions and constitutes an obstacle to
       disarmament agreements. It is possible that we could meet this situation, without necessarily
       increasing our total strategic effort, by a greater relative emphasis on defense in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> strategic doctrine. Such emphasis might contribute to arms
       control in two ways: (a) greater <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> defensive effort would
       complicate Soviet strategic planning and make their strategic effort more costly, thereby
       imposing further economic pressure for limiting arms; (b) if Soviet leaders want to reach
       agreement, a more balanced, mixed system might make agreement more feasible because of
       somewhat greater similarity in defense posture.</p>
                        <p>Second, the erosion of our ability to limit damage to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
       is creating doubts about the firmness of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> nuclear
       commitments. Even if defenses are far from perfect, doing something about defense could
       create a psychological climate which could be somewhat reassuring (without necessarily being
       falsely reassuring) both for our public and our allies.</p>
                        <p>Finally, quite aside from its merits, we should also recognize that the prospect of defense
       against missiles continues to have domestic political appeal. If the Soviets continue to
       deploy an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> and we deploy only for protection against
       China, this will remain a political issue in this country.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, a greater emphasis on defense also presents us with many problems. As
       has often been pointed out, no combination of defense and counterforce can begin to provide
       complete protection against the Soviets. A larger <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> program
       could further stimulate <pb n="613" xml:id="pg_613" facs="0641"/>arms competition, and would
       be even more likely to do so if undertaken in conjunction with further improvements to our
       offensive forces. Furthermore, deployment of <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s and greater
       emphasis on civil defense will create opposition from many allies who are concerned that this
       will intensify the arms race.</p>
                        <p>Clearly, we should make a more intensive effort to analyze the pros and cons of the
       damage-limiting issue as it affects our foreign relations. In the meantime, we should not
       take positions which will make it more difficult for us to expand our defensive programs
       should we wish to do so in the future.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">5. Recommendations:</p>
                        <p>a. That the Secretary of State, through the Under Secretary, request the SIG to arrange for
       appropriate political-military contingency planning in light of the above analysis. Such
       planning should focus in particular on the Middle East and Africa and should consider where
       and how the Soviets would be most likely to intervene in local conflicts if they should be
       requested to do so by a local government or revolutionary movement.</p>
                        <p>b. That the Secretary of State suggest to the Secretary of Defense the need for State and
       Defense jointly to develop a rationale for our strategic forces, to be used in the
       forthcoming <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> posture statement, which takes into account
       the impact of that statement on the Soviets and our allies. Particular attention should be
       paid to the way in which our assured destruction and damage-limiting objectives and
       capabilities are described.<note n="4" xml:id="d258fn4">

        suggested reconsideration of U.S. policy of “not insisting upon Soviet defectors

        confrontation protection to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in event of
        re-defection.” (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. We have reviewed confrontation policy regarding Soviet defectors as recommended reftel,
       taking into account legitimate intelligence objectives, influence which our policy may have
       on future Soviet conduct toward American defectors, humanitarian considerations, and
       continuing need avoid unnecessary complications in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet
       relations. As a result we intend to notify all agencies concerned with handling Soviet
       defectors that:</p>
                        <p>A. In general it is Dept policy that Soviet Government shall be notified of Soviet
       defectors to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and that arrangements will be made for
       confrontation of such defectors with Soviet representatives if Soviet Govt. requests.</p>
                        <p>B. Accordingly, all defectors should be told immediately after they come under our control
       (in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> or abroad) that the Soviet Government will in due
       course be informed of their defection and that they must agree to a confrontation if this
       should prove necessary.</p>
                        <p>C. If intelligence community considers that facts of a particular defection case are such
       that notification and/or confrontation may jeopardize intelligence objectives, burden of
       proof is on community to demonstrate to <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> the existence
       of this potential danger. <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> will then decide appropriate
       course of action.<note n="3" xml:id="d259fn3">On January 19, 1968, <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> sent identical letters to <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HJE1">Hoover</persName>, and

                        </p>
                        <p>2. We believe that under this policy <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government will
       retain that measure of flexibility we may consider desirable in sensitive cases (e.g.
       Svetlana) and that may be requested and needed by intelligence community in critical cases
       (e.g. defector case). In particular we recognize that defection cases occurring abroad
       sometimes present delicate problems of relations with third countries so that decisions
       regarding <pb n="615" xml:id="pg_615" facs="0643"/>notice and confrontation in these
       situations must be based on facts of the particular case.</p>
                        <p>3. We intend that above procedure shall go into effect immediately and that it will be
       applied to Eastern European as well as Soviet defectors.</p>
                        <p>4. Should be noted that this procedure is applicable only to defectors cases, not
       refugee-type cases with which intelligence community has no direct concern. It would not be
       applicable to cases where Soviet (or other East European) citizens with non-diplomatic visas
       in this country might apply to INS for adjustment of status under Section 245 of Immigration
       Act. We doubt that it would be feasible or desirable for INS to require that applicants agree
       to confrontation with Soviet representatives as precondition for INS approval of adjustment
       application.</p>

       1967–1968</p>
                        <p rend="center">General Perspective</p>
                        <p>1. History may ultimately record that the Soviet Union of Brezhnev, Kosygin, and company
       was not much different in its essentials from the Soviet Union of Nikita Khrushchev. There
       are, of course, notable differences in temperament and style between the present careful
       collective and the impulsive and impatient Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. But—in contrast with the impressive series of changes
       which occurred in the aftermath of the death of Stalin—the main lines of Soviet
       doctrine and policy have remained substantially unaltered in the roughly three years since
       the fall of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                        <pb n="616" xml:id="pg_616" facs="0644"/>
                        <p>2. It is true, nevertheless, that under a collective leadership there have been important
       changes in the way that national policy is formulated and in the way that it is carried out.
       If the present leaders have not been inclined to find new paths or to seek new purposes, they
       have nonetheless repudiated <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
       excesses of style and extremes of policy. They have chosen to reign as a largely colorless
       committee and to govern primarily through compromise and consensus. They seem to
       recognize—as <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> often did
       not—that many of the problems facing them are very complex and that their ability
       to act on these problems is limited. Another domestic undertaking comparable to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s vast program to transform the Virgin
       Lands, for example, would seem to be beyond the courage and the capacities of the collective.
       Similarly, abroad, another move analogous to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s brash (and disastrous) missile venture in the Western
       Hemisphere would seem to be completely out of character for the wary group of men now in the
       Kremlin.</p>
                        <p>3. Thus the spirit of the collective is cautious. Perhaps as important, the machinery of
       the collective is cumbersome. It is certainly an oversimplification to say that, if <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> controlled the bureaucracy, the bureaucracy controls
       his successors. There is, however, some truth to this notion. <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>, for example, often seems to speak for the professional party
       apparatus; <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> usually spoke to it. In any
       case, with a variety of views and interests represented within the Politburo, it cannot
       always be easy to arrive at decisions and may often then be difficult to execute them.
       Moreover, it is clear that there are strong disagreements among the top leaders over such
       diverse matters as the pace and character of economic reform, the proper allocation of the
       nation's economic resources, and what some regard as the declining momentum of
       Soviet foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>4. The shortcomings of committee rule, together with the political appetites of the leaders
       who operate within it, are matters of common knowledge and concern within the Soviet
       establishment. And certainly the inadequacies of accomplishment and the failures of policy
       serve to give the discontented and the ambitious both a pretext and a reason for seeking
       change. But no one can say—and perhaps least of all themselves—how many
       specific failures (such as their inability to foresee or forestall the Arab collapse in the
       June war) the present leaders can suffer, or how many chronic issues (such as their constant
       struggle over economic priorities) they can endure.</p>
                        <p>5. Nevertheless, if the present Soviet leadership, standing on the brink of a new year, is
       of a mind to congratulate itself, it could do so on several grounds. First, it has, after
       all, managed to survive for more than three years without major changes in its composition or
       in the way that it functions, and—whatever happens in the future—this
       in itself <pb n="617" xml:id="pg_617" facs="0645"/>is no small accomplishment. Second, even
       if they should not claim the lion's share of credit for themselves, the top
       leaders have at least helped to put some momentum back into an economy which, under <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, was showing signs of foundering. Third, they have
       some reason for satisfaction in a number of lesser gains, including a measure of progress in
       the implementation of the limited economic reform program, and some apparent improvement in
       relations with the general public as a result of the increased availability of consumer goods
       during the 50th Anniversary year. In the international sphere, they can feel some pleasure
       about the way events are moving in Western Europe and about the trend of their relations with
       Turkey, Iran and India. They have preserved their foothold in the Middle East and probably
       think their chances of expanding it are good. They can also derive some comfort from the
       distress the United States is suffering from the war in Vietnam. Concerning the Communist
       movement, they can feel substantial relief at the way Peking has damaged its own
       position.</p>
                        <p>6. Despite accomplishments such as these, the Soviet leaders, looking back on the year just
       past, have little reason for jubilation. Indeed, they have reason devoutly to hope that next
       year will be better than last, for 1967 brought them woe as well as blessings.</p>
                        <p>Thus, at home, 1967 brought them:</p>
                        <p>—in the economy, the slighting of investment, the key to future growth;</p>
                        <p>—within the leadership, an apparent intensification of controversy over the
       question of resource allocations;</p>
                        <p>—and, in the area of popular and party morale, waning ideological fervor,
       unrelieved discontent among many writers and artists, and continuing restiveness among the
       young.</p>
                        <p>And thus, abroad, 1967 also brought the leaders:</p>
                        <p>—surprise and pain at the Arab military debacle in the six-day war in the Middle
       East;</p>
                        <p>—some reason for increasing concern over the possibility that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would take actions which would enlarge the war in Vietnam,
       raising the question of more direct Soviet involvement;</p>
                        <p>—anxiety over the potential dangers of Mao's cultural revolution,
       frustration over the antics of the Cubans and the Rumanians, and dismay over their inability
       to restore discipline among the Communist parties of the world.</p>
                        <p>7. What of the new year 1968? Will it bring a similar mixture of profit and loss, pleasure
       and pain? Probably so. Domestic prospects are not especially bright. The question of resource
       allocation, for example, will almost certainly remain at issue, and contention between the
       regime and some of its unhappy subjects is not likely to be dealt with in any effective and
       lasting way. Much the same can be said about the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s prospects abroad. The urge to compete with, to outdo, and indeed
        <pb n="618" xml:id="pg_618" facs="0646"/>to undo the United States in most areas of the
       world and in most areas of international policy will no doubt remain one of the strongest
       impulses behind Soviet policy. At the same time, this urge is likely to some extent to be
       curbed by the Soviets' appreciation of the limitations of their own capacities and
       by their awareness that nuclear conflict between the two great powers would be mutually
       suicidal. Thus, the quandary the Soviets find themselves in vis-á-vis the United
       States will almost certainly remain precisely that during 1968.</p>
                        <p>8. Moscow, however, will certainly see opportunities for gain in 1968 which it may be all
       the more eager to exploit because of the strategic standoff with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. Though essentially cautious, the Soviet leadership is conscious of its
       “superpower” role and of a steadily growing capacity to make its
       political, economic and military weight felt in areas outside its traditional orbit. There is
       every reason to expect that Moscow will be especially alert to extract advantage from the
       position it has established in the Arab world and in the Mediterranean Basin generally. Here,
       as elsewhere in the Third World, military aid will continue to provide a handy opening wedge,
       though there will be both trials and errors and the Soviets will find it impossible to impose
       a single pattern on relations with these countries. In Europe, there will be further losses
       in the East, some progress in the West. Toward China, there is a chance of a modest
       improvement in relations only if Mao should die or be replaced.</p>
                        <p>9. The ambivalence involved in seeking to compete with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> without confrontation will lead to uncertainties and, at times, arguments within
       the leadership. Even should the leadership change appreciably (and this is always possible),
       its collective nature will probably endure over the short term. To many of the Soviet
       leaders, the power relationship with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, though improving,
       will continue to appear unsatisfactory; some will wish to devote priority attention to all
       manner of efforts to eliminate the imbalance. Others, however, will see less need of this,
       will be content to settle for an adequate level of deterrence; any other course, they would
       fear, would simply provoke the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to an even greater military
       effort and force the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> into arms expenditures which could
       only cripple the Soviet economy as a whole.</p>
                        <p>10. Although disagreements as fundamental as this are not likely to be resolved totally
       next year, there are few grounds for the West to be encouraged about the general trend of
       Soviet thinking. The pattern of recent developments—the tenor of public discourse,
       the disbursement of funds, the completion of missile silos, the reluctance of the Soviets to
       discuss <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> offers concerning arms control, the Soviet posture
       in the Middle East, and even the increasing eminence of <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>—all these signs suggest that the leadership has concluded
       that it must continue to seek major improvements in the Soviet strategic position, even at
       the risk of jeopardizing economic growth.</p>
                        <pb n="619" xml:id="pg_619" facs="0647"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. The Political Scene: Domestic and Foreign</p>
                        <p>[Here follow the Introduction and a section on Internal Politics.]</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Foreign Policy</p>
                        <p>11. The present leaders would like to see Soviet power and ideology become dominant on a
       world scale. As a real prospect, however, the notion of a world-wide Soviet triumph has long
       since lost much of its substance and virtually all its immediacy. Too many things have
       happened in recent years—too much trouble with the economy, too many rows with the
       Chinese and within the international movement, and too few gains against the
       West—to permit any responsible Soviet leaders to view the future with the kind of
       simplistic optimism once expressed by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                        <p>12. But if the Soviets now understand that there are definite limits to their ability to
       shape and exploit the course of events abroad, they have not as yet shown signs of accepting
       this appreciation gracefully. They sometimes seem most reluctant to match their ambitions to
       their means. Consequently, Soviet foreign policies now seem to reflect both a new
       sophistication (a more realistic and flexible awareness of national interests) and an old
       simplicity (the dogmatic insistence that the world conform to the Soviet image of it). This
       ambivalence can be expected to persist for some time and to be evident in the way Moscow
       deals with the most pressing international issues now facing it.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Relations With the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        </p>
                        <p>13. In no aspect of Soviet foreign policy is this ambivalence more conspicuous than in
       relations with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. The attitudes of the Soviet leaders are
       conditioned by persistent, underlying suspicion of the purposes of the foremost
       “imperialist” state, on the one hand, and, on the other, by an
       awareness of the dangers in the nuclear age of uncontrolled antagonism between the two great
       powers. The second of these conflicting impulses has, in general, prevailed under the
       collective leadership, as indeed it did under <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, but not without creating tensions in the policy-making process. In
       particular instances, where decisions affecting relations with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> were concerned, hesitancy, ambiguities and the attraction of a harder
       anti-imperialist line have been apparent. From time to time, episodes occur, such as the
       recent drugging of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military attachZ and his British
       colleague and similar KGB-engineered incidents, which are hardly contrived to improve the
       state of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations.</p>
                        <p>14. The Soviet leaders have publicly asserted that no resolution of basic differences with
       the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is conceivable so long as the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is involved in the war in Vietnam. But they have also indicated (and, during the
       Middle East crisis, demonstrated) a strong desire to keep the lines open to Washington. And
       though they have at times insisted that <pb n="620" xml:id="pg_620" facs="0648"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations must remain frozen for the duration, they have
       been willing to conclude specific agreements (e.g., on the peaceful uses of outer space) and
       to negotiate about others (e.g., nuclear proliferation) when they saw larger advantage to
       Soviet policy. In formulating its policies toward the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, the
       leadership has been unable to resolve the contradictory demands of a policy which seeks, on
       the one hand, gains against the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in Europe, the Middle East
       and elsewhere and, on the other, a tacit understanding with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to avoid measures and countermeasures which would seriously risk international
       crises.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Arms Control</p>
                        <p>15. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> does not view arms control as a problem of
       great urgency. Moscow does see, however, some political profit in disarmament negotiations
       and in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet agreement on certain limited forms of
       control, such as a nuclear nonproliferation treaty, especially when it can be used as a means
       of promoting the political and military containment of West Germany. There is no reason to
       believe that the desirability of a treaty has been at issue within the Soviet leadership.</p>
                        <p>16. Other arms control proposals now pending hold little interest for Moscow. Thus, for
       example, proposals to restrain the world arms trade are not likely to appeal to the Soviets
       since such trade and aid is clearly regarded in Moscow as its primary political tool in the
       Third World. And concerning measures of greater scope, such as the control of strategic
       weapons, the Soviets are likely to proceed with great caution and suspicion. In this
       instance, the collective leadership's characteristic hesitancy when faced with
       questions of considerable import is probably compounded by the apprehensions of the Soviet
       military, by the baneful influence of Vietnam on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet
       relations, and possibly by differences of opinion within the leadership as well. It is
       possible that the Soviet leaders will, after considerable agonizing among themselves, decide
       to enter into exploratory discussions with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> on the
        <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> question, but for the present the prospects appear to be
       slight that they would be willing to agree to any comprehensive program of strategic arms
       control.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Vietnam</p>
                        <p>17. The Soviet leaders have seen in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> involvement in the
       war in Vietnam an opportunity for diplomatic and political profit, and they have been quick
       to try to exploit this opportunity wherever possible (as for example, in Western Europe).
       They are also concerned, however, that through their own involvement in the war they might
       become embroiled in situations which they could not control. Neither the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> nor North Vietnam, the principal actors in the conflict, is very
       susceptible to Soviet influence; either of them could behave independently in a way which
       could test the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s resolve, strain its
       resources, and <pb n="621" xml:id="pg_621" facs="0649"/>risk its direct involvement. But, if
       uncomfortable about the degree of their commitment to an ally which has a will of its own and
       which pursues a cause (control of the South) which is not of vital concern to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, the Soviets nonetheless see no acceptable alternative.
       Almost certainly, they hope Hanoi or Washington, or both, will some day make a political
       solution to the war possible. In the meantime, they will seek to persuade the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> not to escalate the conflict any further and to agree to terms
       for a settlement which would be acceptable to North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">China</p>
                        <p>18. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s delight at the way China was
       able to dissipate its resources in the Communist world by behaving bizarrely at home seems to
       have been tempered by concern over China's rabid hostility, bewilderment over the
       course of events inside China, and apprehension over what might happen next. Over the last
       few years, the Soviets have strengthened their armed forces along the Sino-Soviet frontier
       and in Mongolia and—though probably fearing only border skirmishing—are
       probably preparing for more serious contingencies. In the political and propaganda arena, the
       Soviets have won handsome dividends by striking an attitude of cool restraint toward the
       Chinese. Although it is conceivable that there are varying estimates within the Soviet
       leadership of the long-term outlook for Sino-Soviet relations, it is most unlikely that
       Moscow will consider an alternative to its present course as long as the Mao faction remains
       in power in Peking.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Communist Movement</p>
                        <p>19. By and large, the trend toward declining Soviet authority in the Communist world has
       not been arrested. Among the Eastern European states, Rumania has been the most vocal and
       demonstrative in claiming the right to pursue its national interests largely according to its
       own lights, but such tendencies are growing, though more quietly, elsewhere in the region.
       And the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s problems with Castro's
       Cuba—particularly over whether Latin America is ripe for revolutionary upheaval or
       not—make the emotional gulf between the two Communist states ever wider.</p>
                        <p>20. At the same time the Soviets have some successes to their credit. They have managed to
       slow down the movement in Eastern Europe toward broader contacts with West Germany and other
       West European states. They have also finally, thanks again in no small part to Chinese
       extremism, made a step toward the convening of a unity conference of the international
       movement. Nevertheless, it is evident that the kind of international Communist cohesion that
       Moscow longs for is a forlorn hope. Most of the Communist parties which will gather in
       Budapest in February to “consult” on an international conference want
       no part of a Soviet-imposed policy consensus.</p>
                        <pb n="622" xml:id="pg_622" facs="0650"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Europe</p>
                        <p>21. The Soviet leaders appear to be convinced that their generally conciliatory approach to
       Western Europe is a promising one and seem to recognize that they would have much to lose and
       little to gain by reverting to a harsher policy. They will probably continue for some time
       their present line of trying to persuade the West Europeans that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is beginning to disengage from Europe and that détente with a
       benevolent Soviet Union is an ever growing possibility. The Soviets will almost certainly
       continue publicly to treat West Germany as a pariah, but will privately seek to explore the
       possibility of movement in Bonn toward acceptance of the status quo in Germany.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Middle East</p>
                        <p>22. The Soviet decision in the midst of the Arab-Israeli conflict to start some replacement
       of military equipment in friendly Arab countries was probably provisional, intended primarily
       as a political holding action and not as an encouragement to continued Arab militancy. But
       the Soviets must recognize that, if they wish to enlarge their influence in the area, an aim
       they are very unlikely to abandon, they have no alternative to continuing to work with the
       radical Arabs. The speed with which the Soviets moved into the military vacuum opened up by
       the Egyptians in the Yemen and their incipient courtship of Jordan are proof that Moscow will
       not be backward in exploring avenues of new influence. But it is still unlikely that they
       will wish to do this by entering into actual military alliances with any of the Arab states,
       for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has no desire to give these states a hold over
       its policies. The establishment of Soviet bases in the area would contain some of the same
       hazards and would, in addition, seriously undercut the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s “anti-imperialist” stance. Short of this,
       however, Moscow is likely to see both political and military advantage in expanding its
       military presence in the area.</p>
                        <p>23. Moscow will continue to exploit anti-Western attitudes in Arab countries, but it will
       not run the military risks or accept the political costs of identifying itself with Arab
       aspirations to destroy Israel. It follows also, however, that—barring a major
       change in Arab attitudes—the Soviets will not give very much help to diplomatic
       efforts to move toward a basic settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Third World</p>
                        <p>24. Partly as a result of its experiences in recent years in such places as the Congo,
       Ghana and Indonesia, the Soviet Union's confidence that it possesses a reliable
       formula for dealing with the Third World has diminished. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s simplistic assumption that the underdeveloped nations
       were animated by a single economic and social impulse which could be exploited in a uniform
       way has been confounded <pb n="623" xml:id="pg_623" facs="0651"/>by events. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has made steady progress in increasing its influence in the
       states on its southern periphery, such as Iran and Turkey, and will continue to give careful
       attention to its relations with them. Elsewhere in the Third World, it is questionable
       whether the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s political profits have been
       commensurate with its expenditures of cash and diplomatic energy. In any case, recent history
       has demonstrated that military and economic aid and the appeal of common socialist
       aspirations cannot guarantee the Soviet Union a stable political foothold in the midst of
       nationalist turbulence.</p>
                        <p>25. In Latin America, Moscow, seeing little prospect that the Communists can achieve power
       in the present circumstances by insurrectionary methods, has counseled the parties of the
       area to pursue united front tactics wherever possible. Meanwhile, the Soviets themselves,
       despite Castro's angry protests, are trying to build for the future on the basis
       of expanded commercial, consular and diplomatic ties with governments of varying political
       coloration. Much the same approach is taken toward Africa and the non-Communist nations of
       Southeast Asia and the Far East.</p>
                        <p>26. Despite its disappointments, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will almost
       certainly maintain sizable aid programs for the less developed countries. Economic aid
       patterns may change; there are signs of a more discriminating approach and a shift to greater
       emphasis on military aid. But, while new extensions of economic assistance have been
       declining, total drawings by recipient states next year are likely to be about the same as in
       recent years, about $300–350 million.</p>
                        <p>27. The lessons of the Middle East war have obviously not made the Russians any the less
       ready to use military aid as an instrument of political influence. To this end, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is evidently fully prepared, where opportunity arises and
       where geography permits, as in the case of Nigeria and the Yemen, to call on its capacity to
       provide military aid promptly and in quantity. Despite their reluctance to make extended
       commitments, the Soviet leaders are almost certainly convinced that, as a great power, the
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has a legitimate interest in practically all areas of
       the world and a political need to assert that interest.</p>

                        <p>2404. Subject: Review of Past Year.</p>
                        <p>1. Today being the first anniversary of my current sentence to Moscow I have been
       reflecting upon the events of the past year. I can take little personal satisfaction from a
       record of no hits, no runs and I hope no errors. The limbo in which we have been placed by
       the Vietnam affair as well as the style and methods of the present leadership has reduced my
       function here largely to a holding operation. In the days of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, chiefs of mission here had frequent contact with the leadership
       which, at least in the case of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, was
       loquacious and provided much material upon which to base analysis and forecast. This has
       radically changed and even my French and British colleagues who have frequent contacts with
       the leadership because of many high-level visits and cooperative undertakings derive little
       profit from them. This is somewhat balanced for the Embassy as a whole by some increase in
       lower-level contacts and a marked increase in the amount and quality of general information
       and leaks that the missions here get either directly or through the press corps.</p>
                        <p>2. In view of the superabundance of material on the Soviet Union stimulated by the
       Soviets' fiftieth anniversary and the fact that the Embassy is preparing a
       comprehensive annual review, I shall confine myself to flagging what appear to me to be the
       highlights of recent developments.</p>
                        <p>3. Perhaps the most important single issue is the role of the Communist Party. The party
       under current leadership has failed to adapt either its ideology or its methods to modern
       conditions. Hence there has been a widening gap between it and various elements of society,
       the most striking examples being the youth and the intellectuals. There has taken place a
       kind of fragmentation of Soviet society and while the party continues to run the show, the
       various interest groups have more influence than formerly. This may in part be due to
        <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s lack of dynamic leadership and
       the fact that the Politburo must in most matters reach a collective decision leaving room for
       maneuver by the component elements of society. In any event it is clear that the military for
       instance have far more influence than before. Unfortunately the same is true of the KGB and
       their influence is clearly regressive. This is the <pb n="625" xml:id="pg_625" facs="0653"/>more serious as under Andropov they are closely tied in to the leadership. Over the long
       run, however, I believe the pressures for liberalization are so strong that the regime will
       be obliged to take account of them.</p>
                        <p>4. An important factor in this picture is the program of economic reform. If the reforms
       are to succeed, the role of the party in the management of the economy on the local level
       will have to be reduced and this should result in greater liberalization. It is unlikely,
       however, that the reforms will be bold enough or carried out with sufficient vigor to resolve
       the basic problems of the Soviet economy and the fact of two good agricultural years in a row
       may obscure the continued need for drastic change in that sector. Apart from weakness of
       system and management, the Soviets cannot hope for startling economic progress so long as
       they devote such a large proportion of their resources to military and related purposes.
       Despite the fact that the Soviet Union has made little if any progress in its attempt to
       overtake the United States in industrial production, it has continued to expand its enormous
       military and economic power. Moreover its people seek evolution and not revolution and unless
       the regime should ignore the desires of the population completely they will remain securely
       in power, although changes in personalities are inevitable. Regardless of the direction which
       Soviet policy takes, even if Vietnam is settled, the highly competitive nature of the
       Russians combined with the compulsions of Communist ideology will insure continued rivalry
       with the United States. I continue to believe, however, that our interests lie in doing
       whatever we can to stimulate the liberal trends in this country in the hope of reaching a
       situation in which real coexistence will be possible.</p>
                        <p>5. In foreign affairs the Soviet record has been mixed. Continued deterioration in their
       relations with Communist China and with Cuba, and further weakening in the ties binding the
       Communist Bloc, were partly offset by French actions weakening <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the chaos in China which diminished its challenge to Soviet leadership of
       the Communist world. Serious errors were made in the Middle East crisis, but the overall
       result of that affair cannot be judged at this stage. Looking backward, however, there can be
       little doubt that Soviet influence in the Middle East is far greater than it was a few years
       ago.</p>
                        <p>6. In Southeast Asia I continue to believe that the Soviets would like to see a political
       settlement chiefly because of the risks involved in continued conflict, the possibility of
       eventual U.S. success damaging to the policy of support for wars of liberation, the prolonged
       humiliation of not being able to protect a fellow socialist country, the economic costs, and
       the frustration of the policy of peaceful coexistence. However, there are advantages to them
       in the present situation so long as the situation does not get out of control, and whether
       due to lack of <pb n="626" xml:id="pg_626" facs="0654"/>leverage in Hanoi, the rivalry with
       China or divided views in Soviet leadership, the Soviets are unlikely to do much to bring
       about a settlement.</p>
                        <p>7. For the present the Soviets will maintain their policy of trying to isolate West Germany
       and to force recognition of the East German regime, but sooner or later they are likely to
       make a strong play for some kind of deal with the Federal Republic.</p>
                        <p>8. My general impression is that the Soviet leadership is somewhat muscle-bound. It is out
       of phase with the times internally, as well as in its relations with the Communist Bloc. In
       its relations with the West and the third world it is also hamstrung by adherence to an
       outmoded ideology. This is probably a transitional period and sooner or later the leaders
       will have to face many of the problems they have been evading or attempting to compromise.
       Given the underlying pressures, the eventual outcome should be in the right direction even
       though the present phase is retrograde.</p>
                        <p>9. Cultural and scientific exchanges, tourism and commerce are among the few means of
       influence we have and I would hope that post Vietnam, if not before, we can proceed to remove
       the barriers to expanded trade. But as long as policy making is in the hands of what is
       generally a narrow minded group of party officials who see the world through thick Marxist
       lenses, progress in accommodation with the West and liberalization internally will be
       slow.</p>

                        <p>On January 18, 1968, the intelligence community issued Special National Intelligence
       Estimate 11–9–68, “Soviet Interests and Activities in Arab States.” The
       estimate concluded that “the main Soviet objective in the Middle East remains
       essentially the same as before the June war—to win for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> a position as dominant foreign power in the area.”
       However, “the Soviets are not likely to make binding military commitments to any
       Arab states, and they will almost certainly remain wary of direct involvement even in limited
       conflicts in the Middle East.” The text of the <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss>'s conclusions is scheduled for publication in <ref target="frus1964-68v20">

                        <p>102228. For the Ambassador. Request you seek early appointment with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> to make following statement: (If <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> not available within next day or so, you should see
        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and ask him to transmit to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> soonest.)</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Begin Text</hi>. The President has asked me to convey to the Chairman
       personally his gratification at recent development in Geneva which enabled our two
       representatives to table complete identical texts of a non-proliferation treaty on January
       18. The President regards this as encouraging evidence that we can overcome differences in
       viewpoint and other obstacles in reaching agreement on an issue vital to the preservation of
       peace. He is hopeful that it will now be possible to move forward towards prompt approval of
       the draft treaty within the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in order that it may be signed and brought into force at the
       earliest practicable time.</p>
                        <p>The President has asked me, at the same time, to convey to the Chairman his sense of
       urgency over two related pressing issues, namely, progress towards limiting the strategic
       nuclear arms race, and restraint in the delivery of armament to the nations of the Middle
       East.</p>
                        <p>The President recalls that, in his letter of May 22, 1967,<note n="2" xml:id="d263fn2">See
         <ref target="#d215">Document 215</ref>.</note> to the Chairman, he had expressed the
       conviction that our task of persuading the non-nuclear powers to accept a non-proliferation
       treaty would be greatly eased if you and we could demonstrate concurrently our will and
       ability to bring the nuclear arms race under better control. This remains his strong
       view.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, both our nations are now expanding enormous resources in the development and
       deployment of offensive and defensive strategic weapons systems which, by their impact on the
       security requirements of both countries, compel an ever-widening spiral of armament from
       which neither nation can expect to derive any greater security. On the contrary, with the
       rapid development of technology and the massing of increasingly complex arrays of weapons,
       the danger increases. The President has asked me to make clear that in proposing discussions
       between our Governments on this issue, he in no way seeks <pb n="628" xml:id="pg_628" facs="0656"/>military advantage; on the contrary, he seeks a solution through a limitation
       on arms based upon full appreciation by each side of the national interests and security of
       the other—a security which he is convinced will not be served by a continuation of
       our present course. The President believes, therefore, it is in our mutual interest to begin
       official talks now in order to resolve this problem at the earliest practicable moment.</p>
                        <p>On the question of arms to the Middle East, the Chairman will have received by now
       Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s report of his
       conversation with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> on January 9. This
       matter, too, is urgent and the President has asked me to stress his deep concern at the
       impact that continued arms traffic may have on the Middle East situation. We know from past
       experience that resort to arms is an ever-present danger in the Middle East. Not only does
       such action not resolve the problem, but it poses the danger of the spread of war beyond the
       confines of the area. The President has watched with growing concern the extensive delivery
       of arms to the area from the Soviet Union. The United States is under considerable pressure,
       as a consequence, to take matching action. Despite this pressure, my Government has exercised
       great restraint, most recently in its agreement to provide Israel with only limited numbers
       of aircraft, without new models, and only in continuation of our agreement with Israel of
       1966. By agreeing only to this limited extension of the 1966 agreement and by deferring
       decision on the introduction of new advanced aircraft into the area, we have exercised
       restraint and it is the President's earnest hope that this will be reciprocated by
       the Soviet Government. In this way our two governments could assist Ambassador Jarring in
       carrying out his vital mission and thus make a substantial contribution to prospects for a
       just and peaceful settlement in the Middle East.<note n="3" xml:id="d263fn3">

        “Soviet and <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> views coincided” and the
        treaty “should be signed as soon as possible.” On strategic arms, he
        said the Soviets “are still studying the problem” and would
        “give their views later.” On the Middle East, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said “he felt the time had come for the
         <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to join their
        efforts to achieve Israeli withdrawal,” for “if the problem of
        occupied territories were resolved, other things, including the question of armaments, would
        fall in place.” In its formal reply to the U.S. message, dated February 27, the
        Soviet Government again stressed that a speedy Israeli withdrawal was the key to a peace
        settlement. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> replied in a March 9 message to
         <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, emphasizing the urgency of an arms
        limitation agreement without awaiting the “settlement of certain other aspects of
        the conflict.” Moreover, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> stated, the
        Soviet position that a peaceful settlement depended on a prior Israeli withdrawal was not
        consistent with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Resolution 242. The February 27 Soviet
        message and <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s reply, transmitted in
        telegram 127656, are scheduled for publication ibid. In a May 2 letter to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, the President again urged an agreement limiting arms
        deliveries. (National Archives and Records Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss>

       ship, was captured off the coast of North Korea by North Korean naval forces. The Department
       of State, in telegram 102940, immediately instructed the Embassy in Moscow to contact Soviet
       Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> “to express in
       strongest terms our view that Soviets should be in touch with North Koreans to obtain
       immediate release of vessel.” For text, see <ref target="frus1964-68v29p1#d212">

        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> replied on January 27, disputing the U.S.

       President's message to the North Koreans. (Telegram 2604 from Moscow; ibid., <ref target="#d230">Document 230</ref>) The next day the Department informed the Embassy in
       Moscow that even though the Soviets obviously regarded official contacts concerning the
       Pueblo to be “awkward and even annoying,” it was “essential
       we remain in close communication with Sovs to stress gravity of situation.”

       Johnson responded on February 5 that “North Korea will not be permitted to direct
       its military forces against South Korea and that American flag vessels are not to be seized

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Introduction and Summary</p>
                        <p>Three years after the ouster of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, the
       Soviet regime remains a dictatorial oligarchy excessively concerned with problems of security
       both at home and abroad. It is in the paradoxical situation of issuing from on high
       directives demanding the exercise of initiative from below. Despite some success in
       strengthening the country's economic and military might, the regime more often
       than not seems to conduct itself as if its primary concern was to defend its right to
       rule.</p>
                        <p>The fact is, the present leaders can point with justifiable pride to some attainments of
       the last fifty years, not the least of which are the successful seizure and consolidation of
       power; an industrialization program which shifted the country from fifth to second place
       among the world powers; and finally, its role in the dramatic defeat of the German-led
       coalition of World War II. Even from the vantage point of only three years since their palace
       coup against <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, they can look with some
       satisfaction at their own performance record. They have produced some measurable economic
       progress and provided a semblance of political stability, if only for the reason that they
       have survived as a group despite changes in the pecking order and continuing differences. At
       the same time, however, reflecting upon their own virtuosity in seizing power and looking
       back at the conditions under which so many of the achievements of the last fifty years were
       attained—the terrible purges, and loss of twenty million lives and the vast
       devastation of the land during the War, and the inability of the system to curb either a <pb n="631" xml:id="pg_631" facs="0659"/>paranoic Stalin or the erratic
       Khrushchev—the mantle of rule most certainly rests uneasily upon their
       shoulders.</p>
                        <p>The present leadership with some justification has been criticized for lack of verve. In
       part, their collective, colorless image stands out sharply because of the obvious contrast
       with the flamboyance of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. In part, it is a
       direct reflection of the personalities of the leaders themselves. Their caution is
       understandable given the fact that for roughly three decades or more all of the present group
       have been members of a party with a long conspiratorial history. Their policies bear all the
       earmarks of a product of consensus which permits maximum maneuvering for all vested
       interests. Like the early <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, his successors
       are addressing the right issues. But unlike him, they seem to be more aware of the
       complexities and inter-relationships between the problems.</p>
                        <p>The void created by the absence of a visible and dynamic leader; the continued use of
       warmed-over revolutionary verbiage; and an over-dosage of introspection and xenophobia have
       all tended to obscure the fact that the present leadership has undertaken some policies of
       import and not entirely without success. They have, for example, been able to keep relations
       with the United States on an almost even keel, and have successfully exploited the irrational
       excesses of Peking to cut real or potential losses in the world communist movement. They also
       extricated themselves better than they had the right to expect from the imbroglio following
       the Arab rout in the June crisis and at the moment, at least, they seem to be advancing their
       cause in the Middle East. At home, although they clearly have not resolved the well-nigh
       intractable problem of resource allocation, they have started upon an economic reform. And
       although their approach to this problem has been hesitant and there has been some consequent
       loss of momentum, the program, in and of itself, is a step in the right direction.</p>
                        <p>In general, however, the record of the present leadership is not particularly auspicious
       either at home or abroad. Their ability to deal with the multitudinous problems is seriously
       affected by their astigmatic view of themselves and the world about them. They are inhibited
       by a persisting commitment to an increasingly outdated ideology. And even though this
       commitment has eroded over time, this regime still seems to feel constrained to explain
       developments and justify its decisions in stereotyped Marxist-Leninist terms. In doing so,
       they frequently create constraints where none exist and create problems that need not have
       arisen.</p>
                        <p>Though the present leaders stress the fact that they are children of the revolution, they
       make it emphatically clear they will not be fathers of another. Indeed, the coarse slogan
       applied to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> of seeking “goulash
       communism” has now been elevated to a party plank <pb n="632" xml:id="pg_632" facs="0660"/>which asserts that the greatest contribution the CPSU can make to world
       communism is the building of an affluent communist society at home. To be sure, the regime
       remains concerned about developments beyond its borders. It can be expected to pursue active
       policies abroad, especially when its hegemonic rule in the communist movement seems
       threatened and its national interests involved. Since the Cuban missile fiasco, if not
       before, the regime appears to have become increasingly inward looking.</p>
                        <p>The number and magnitude of outstanding problems, and the way the present leadership comes
       to grips with them suggest that the present arrangement is an interim one. Conceivably, it
       can continue to muddle through. However, the system and the country need more effective
       leadership if the problems are to be dealt with.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. General Comment</p>
                        <p>Celebrating their Jubilee, the rulers in the Kremlin could take some pride in the fact that
       fifty years after the collapse of Tsarism, the Soviet Union was unquestionably the other
       world superstate. However, with the aggrandizement of power, and after some major setbacks,
       there has also descended upon the Kremlin an awareness of the costs and risks that go with
       it, and consequently a greater sense of responsibility.</p>
                        <p>The Cuban missile crisis served as a major watershed. In its aftermath, and particularly
       since the demise of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, the Soviet leadership
       has not only given greater attention to the solution of major domestic, political and
       economic problems; it has on the international front, in the main, sought to consolidate
       existing positions rather than establish new beachheads. And even when it has become
       embroiled in new and critical situations, it has tended to exercise restraint and caution,
       avoiding overcommitment, and seeking to keep its options open.</p>
                        <p>Though always rationalized in ideological terms, Soviet foreign policy objectives,
       including those within the Communist movement, are clearly geared to the interests of the
       Soviet state. This is not to say that ideology has no impact on foreign policy decisions. The
       fact is that even though the Soviet national goals are guiding, the regime, because of its
       makeup, tends to view world problems through ideologically colored lenses. This, in turn,
       raises not only the specter of misjudgment and miscalculation, but also the possibility of
       missed opportunities.</p>
                        <pb n="633" xml:id="pg_633" facs="0661"/>
                        <p>Despite the strain in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations, the Soviet leaders recognize the necessity of maintaining some
       working relationships with the United States. Not only are they conscious of the political
       importance of such a stance, they also realize that it is essential for preventing a direct
       confrontation with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, and dampening other conflicts that
       could lead to such a confrontation.</p>
                        <p>But the present leadership clearly has reservations about the priority <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> assigned to Soviet relations with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, and has tended to subordinate the development of bilateral
       relations with Washington to other issues of more immediate concern. The most important of
       these seem to be: a) to protect the Soviet positions in Eastern Europe and Asia, threatened
       by the growing nationalist trends among the Warsaw Pact members and by the emergence of a
       hostile China; b) to undermine the cohesion of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, isolate
       its most important member on the continent—the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>—and reduce <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> influence in Europe; c)
       to broaden and strengthen Soviet influence along the underbelly of the Soviet
       Union—the Middle East and the Asian subcontinent; and d) to enhance the Soviet
       Union's position as a global power through selective political and economic
       penetration in other areas of the world.</p>
                        <p>[Here follow sections on “The Communist Movement,”
       “East-West Relations,” and “The Third
       World.”]</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">5. <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet Relations</p>
                        <p>For the past three years, <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations have been
       mostly on dead center rather than frozen. Despite political inhibitions on both sides,
       essential activities have continued. Channels of communication have remained open. The two
       governments have been in contact to deal with major and minor crises. The “hot
       line” was used for the first time during the Middle Eastern crisis. Although
       Glassboro failed to produce perceptible movement on specific issues, it did bring the two
       heads of government together. Behind a smoke-screen of propaganda, the Soviets actively, and
       in some cases constructively, worked with the U.S. delegation at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The Outer Space Treaty, the agreement on the rescue and assistance to
       astronauts, <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet cultural and technical exchanges, <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet fishery arrangements, and the draft non-proliferation
       treaty reflected a coincidence of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Soviet interests in a
       number of areas.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets continue to regard the United States as the primary threat both in political
       and military terms. Soviet sensitivity to American political inroads was striking during the
       Jubilee, when Soviets threatened retribution for alleged American efforts to spoil the 50th
       anniversary. This was particularly emphatic in connection with Svetlana. While in part this
       sensitivity reflects an historical inferiority complex, it is also indicative of Soviet
       concern about the impact of increased contact <pb n="634" xml:id="pg_634" facs="0662"/>with
       the outside world on the Soviet people. But despite the regime's warnings to its
       own people to be chary of foreigners, they for the most part, and particularly the
       intelligentsia, remain friendly to Americans as well as other outsiders and eager to be in
       contact with them and accepted as equals.</p>
                        <p>On the military side, the Soviet leadership does not consider an American attack on the
       USSR a likely possibility. Nevertheless, it continues to regard the United States, as it
       must, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s major and most dangerous
       antagonist. War with the United States remains an essential part of Soviet contingency
       planning. This is necessitated not only because of competing interests, but also because the
       Soviet Union, no more than we, can be certain of the consequences of actions by third
       parties.</p>
                        <p>The Kremlin, at a minimum, is determined to maintain the existing strategic balance between
       the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or preferably
       improve it. While the Soviets are willing to cooperate in measures such as <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, which limit the ability of others to disturb that balance,
       they are distrustful of arrangements which restrict their freedom to strengthen their
       military capabilities. Their failure thus far to respond to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> proposal for talks on offensive and defensive strategic weapons is a case in
       point. Clearly, it is difficult for this leadership to accept any arrangements which would
       tend to freeze the present Soviet inferiority, however meaningless the margin of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> superiority may be from a practical standpoint. Some among the
       Soviet leadership are undoubtedly concerned about the tremendous cost and the practical
       futility of an unlimited arms competition with the United States. But they are almost
       certainly under heavy pressures from those, including the military establishment, who hope
       for an eventual breakthrough, to avoid inhibiting commitments. In addition, there are Soviets
       who probably view every element in the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military build-up,
       even those clearly designed to deal with other situations, as ultimately aimed against the
       Soviet Union, and argue for adequate countermeasures.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets undoubtedly realize that the United States desires as avidly as they the
       avoidance of direct confrontation. But Moscow appears unsure about American motives and
       purposes. Even allowing for the fact that their propaganda exaggerates considerably the
       reality, one point that is strikingly clear is that the present Soviet leaders do not trust
       the United States or its broader efforts to improve relations. The Soviets seem to believe
       that such efforts as bridge building are designed to undermine Soviet influence in what
       Moscow regards as its own domain, to divide Soviet society, to subvert the regime, and to
       weaken the Soviet Union's currency in the international arena. In short, Moscow is
       suspicious and defensive about the United States, and the process of rapprochement is certain
       to be long and tedious, even assuming <pb n="635" xml:id="pg_635" facs="0663"/>Vietnam is
       resolved. But the Soviets recognize that they must live with us. While dramatic moves toward
       cooperation are probably impossible for some time, there is ample room for actions of a
       sufficiently low political profile which could be tailored to the needs of the present and
       help clear the way for future progress on major issues.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. Concluding Comments</p>
                        <p>The tensions generated by convergence of events, particularly Vietnam, have inhibited overt
       contact between the United States and the Soviet Union. But, propaganda campaigns
       notwithstanding, it is also true that levels of tension have been moderated by continuing
       discreet contacts between the two countries on urgent issues (e.g. ME, <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, etc.), as well as by the preservation of a modicum of decorum
       in the every day business of international politics. The two super powers, each of which
       could annihilate the other, have come to understand that they need a talking and working
       relationship. For our part, we have also come to recognize the importance of establishing a
       political position enabling us to help stimulate liberalizing trends in the Soviet Union and
       thereby eventually create a situation in which real co-existence and peaceful competition are
       possible. In this purpose there is potentially wide support within the Soviet Union, support
       which could be broadened significantly if we succeeded in taking the high ground in the
       campaign for the preservation of peace.</p>
                        <p>Certain bilateral enterprises have become institutionalized. While Soviet purposes do not
       necessarily coincide with ours, there is a good reason to assume that for the moment and with
       some adjustments, these enterprises continue to interest them as well as us. This includes
       the whole range of scientific and technical contacts as well as the cultural exchange
       agreement now due for re-negotiation. In a sense, the Soviets demonstrated the value they
       attach to exchanges when they were forced to take a hard look at the exhibits question and
       the consequences of reneging on those commitments. The prospects for future negotiations are
       uncertain. But on balance, there seems to be enough in these arrangements to serve the
       Soviets' purposes, not to mention the political implications of failing to reach a
       mutually satisfactory understanding on this issue. In this connection, continued flexibility
       on our side is in order. Although there is no question of the need for reciprocity, absolute
       symmetry of numbers is not essential.</p>
                        <p>Among the potentially more interesting projects are McGeorge Bundy's proposed
       international center, as well as a variety of joint research projects in the physical and
       biological sciences.</p>
                        <p>Commerce remains a largely unexploited area where considerable American influence could be
       brought to bear. Even with Vietnam, it seems to us we ought to make every effort to remove
       unnecessary barriers <pb n="636" xml:id="pg_636" facs="0664"/>to expand trade. We recognize
       the political difficulties involved. However, in our view, the rationale for the
       President's speech of October 1966 remains valid. It is therefore in our interest
       to demonstrate the Administration's earnest by following through on the
       President's precepts, even though we recognize that there is no likelihood for
       legislation this year.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, the Soviets themselves have made some suggestions worth close
       examination, and, if possible, a positive response. There are Givishiani's
       suggestions for a bilateral review of patent and licensing practices; a nod, albeit
       tentative, from the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Trade toward joint production ventures; an
       exchange of seminars on business management as suggested by the Soviet Embassy in Washington;
       and the Soviets' proposal to review <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> restrictions on the use of port facilities.</p>
                        <p>We might ourselves take the initiative to try to clear away some of the underbrush in
       certain areas of bilateral interest. We should examine ways of improving the range and
       quality of commercial services Embassy Moscow can offer U.S. businessmen. An improved U.S.
       commercial image in Moscow would lend support to the President's East-West
       policies and export promotional activities could help our balance of payments program. The
       sharp percentile increase in direct U.S. exports to the U.S.S.R. last year suggests there are
       significant commercial opportunities here despite legal and political obstacles. We should
       also streamline our export licensing procedures so as to eliminate delay and uncertainty as
       impediments to U.S. exports. We might also re-examine within the U.S. Government the merits
       of the Treasury Department's blocking action against the accounts of the Moscow
       Narodny Bank in the Chase Manhattan Bank. Perhaps nothing can be done. But it can probably
       not be swept under the rug. The Soviets raised this issue with Senator Mondale again last
       month.</p>
                        <p>Efforts to establish acceptable arms control arrangements should remain under
       consideration. In this category, the most important item is our own proposal for the joint
       consideration of offensive and defensive strategic weapons control. The ball on this issue is
       now clearly in the Soviet court.</p>
                        <p>While we have no reason to be optimistic about major breakthroughs at this time, we do have
       elements of a useful program. In this connection, we ought to be particularly alert to
       possibilities of Soviet internal changes and the opportunities these might provide for us and
       our allies. However, we must avoid the temptation to force an unrealistic pace or to assume
       greater Soviet readiness to meet us than actually exists. What we do must not only be
       carefully designed; it must also be discreetly handled and properly timed lest our efforts be
       counterproductive.</p>

                        <p>Since his return to Washington on February 6, after a four-week visit to Moscow, Ambassador
        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> has resumed his contacts with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> officials. He luncheoned with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> on February 15 and made an appointment with Ambassador
        <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> for this week. In his meeting with the
       Secretary, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> gave no indications of having
       special instructions as a result of his Moscow stay, and it is likely that he seeks a tour
       d'horizon with you to bring his exploration of current thinking in the Executive
       Branch up to date.</p>
                        <p>I have attached State 117306 (<gloss target="#t_Exdis1">Exdis</gloss>) which summarizes
        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s talk with the Secretary.<note n="2" xml:id="d267fn2">Dated February 17. Topics included Vietnam peace negotiations, North
        Vietnamese troops in Laos, Cambodian neutrality, the Jarring Mission to the Middle East,
        flights by U.S. and Soviet planes armed with hydrogen bombs, and the Pueblo incident.

                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Strategic Weapons Talks.</hi> The latest exchange was between George
       Bunn and Vorontsov in which the latter repeated <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s earlier comment to <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> might give a favorable
       reply if the Korean problem is settled peacefully.<note n="3" xml:id="d267fn3">

                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Soviet Embassy Bombing</hi>. The Police Department has not turned up
       any suspects in the pre-dawn explosion today at the Soviet Embassy. No one was injured but
       the explosion broke many of the Embassy's windows and caused extensive damage in
       one of its front rooms. Meanwhile, full-time police protection has been extended to include
       the Soviet Information Department and Consular offices in Washington.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> has expressed personal indignation and
       regret over the incident, both orally and in a hand-delivered letter to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>,<note n="4" xml:id="d267fn4">Transmitted to Moscow in

       similarly expressed regrets.</p>

                        <p>Soviet Minister Counselor Yuri N. Chernyakov called on Deputy Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName> this afternoon to protest formally the bombing and
       call for a rapid investigation and for severe punishment of those responsible. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName> rejected a contention in the note that measures on
       the part of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> authorities for protection of the Embassy were
       “completely inadequate.” He voiced our profound regret over the
       incident, noting our acceptance of the principle that the host state should make
       reimbursement for damages to foreign chanceries. At the same time Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName> strongly objected to a <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> English language report that the explosion occurred with the
       “connivance of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> authorities.”<note n="5" xml:id="d267fn5">On May 6 <persName corresp="#p_PJW1">James Pratt</persName> of <gloss target="#t_SOV1">SOV</gloss> turned over to Yuly Vorontsov of the Soviet Embassy a check

       Soviet willingness to hold a bilateral meeting of experts to discuss issues that might arise
       in a possible Law of the Sea Conference, we had intended to inform them that we were ready to
       host the meeting in late February. However, before our response could be given the Pueblo
       incident intervened. We are now considering whether it would be advantageous to proceed with
       the talks at this time. Meanwhile, we have answered frequent Soviet inquiries by simply
       stating that the matter is still under consideration.</p>

       to a timetable for negotiation of a renewal agreement for 1968–69. We are approaching the
       time when further delay will affect exchanges program activities. This would include
       arrangements to place graduate students for the 1968–69 academic year, as well as the tour of
       a Bolshoi Ballet group tentatively booked by <persName corresp="#p_HS1">Hurok</persName> to
       open about April 20. Under similar circumstances in 1966, we told the Soviets that no tour
       could take place without a new agreement and we intend to act similarly this time.</p>

                        <p>The President met Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> at about 6:05
       p.m.</p>
                        <p>The President began by stating that he was going as far as he could in all conscience go,
       given the tactical position in the field. He could not endanger lives of his men on the
       Vietnamese frontiers by having a total bombing cessation. It was up to the Soviet Union as
       Geneva co-chairman <pb n="641" xml:id="pg_641" facs="0669"/>and as a major arms supplier to
       Hanoi to bring its influence to bear for a conference and the making of peace.</p>
                        <p>The President recalled that the Soviet Union had played an important role at Tashkent in
       settling the India-Pak war. He believed, after his talks with Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> at Glassboro, that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> wished to be helpful; although nothing had come of it. But the U.S. and
       the U.S.S.R. had shown in many matters that we could work together for constructive results;
       for example, in the Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>
                        <p>This was a time for everyone to bring to bear the greatest forbearance, restraint, and
       understanding. In South Vietnam itself the contending parties must give up war and seek a
       one-man, one-vote solution.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador should be aware, however, that the U.S. was not going to pull out of
       Vietnam. The proportion of American voters who actually wanted to pull out was about 5%;
       another 15% wanted the President to do less militarily; but there were 40% who wanted the
       U.S. to do more. That was the problem with which he had to deal.</p>
                        <p>The President had great concern about Southeast Asia as a whole, not only Vietnam. He
       feared a much wider war that would be contrary to both our interests and the
       Soviet's interests. He thought perhaps the Chinese were getting
       “cocky” and “chesty.” Their aggressive ambitions
       should not be encouraged. It was up to the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. to end the war in Vietnam
       soon and prevent hostilities from spreading.</p>
                        <p>The President said he had gone 90% of the way; now it was up to the Co-Chairmen to make it
       possible to go the last 10% and start negotiations for peace.<note n="4" xml:id="d268fn4">In
        a June 5 message to the President, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> stated
        that he and his colleagues had grounds for believing that a full cessation of the bombing
        could lead to a breakthrough in the peace negotiations. The text is scheduled for

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked the President to explain
       precisely why a 100% bombing pause was impossible. The President did so, adding that if
        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> thought of what it would be like if there
       were Russian soldiers in the same position as Americans and German forces were approaching,
       he would understand. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that the Soviet
       Union was lucky enough not to be there. The President countered: “But you are
       helping them.”</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked about the area in which we
       would bomb. It was explained: below the 20th parallel.</p>
                        <p>He asked if there was a time limit on the cessation. The President said no firm
       limit—perhaps a few weeks. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said
       that was good. It is better not to have to hurry.</p>

                        <p>Commerce, with the concurrence of State and Defense, is preparing to license $8.9 million
       of gear cutting, testing and measuring machines for the automotive plant Fiat is building in
       the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The machinery is made by the Gleason Works of
       Rochester, New York.</p>
                        <p>The reasons for licensing this equipment are:</p>
                        <p>—<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and Defense say it is not strategic and
       does not involve problems of new or advanced technology. They are sure it will in fact be
       used in the manufacture of Fiat cars.</p>
                        <p>—The sale will not disrupt defense priorities at the Gleason plant.</p>
                        <p>—Comparable equipment is readily available from Switzerland and West Germany.
       They will make the sale if we don't.</p>
                        <p>—Financing is all private. No U.S. Government credit or guaranty facilities are
       involved.</p>
                        <p>—We licensed similar machinery made by the same firm in 1966 for use in a
       Soviet-built automotive plant.</p>
                        <p>You should know, however, that protests will probably follow approval of the license. We
       expect adverse reaction from those members of Congress who have consistently opposed this
       trade. Commerce does not plan to issue a press release but it is preparing a statement of
       facts to answer inquiries. The Ashley Subcommittee on International Trade of the House
       Banking and Currency Committee will be informed.</p>
                        <pb n="643" xml:id="pg_643" facs="0671"/>
                        <p>This is a clear case of advantageous peaceful trade with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The Fiat plant will have a political impact in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> that is in our national interest. Furthermore, the sale is a net gain for our

                        <p>I had lunch with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on Friday,
       April 26. The meeting was at my initiative but at his Embassy. The vodka and lobster were
       excellent. This was the most informal and candid of all my talks with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>.</p>
                        <p>1. My business in proposing the meeting was to enlist the Ambassador in an effort to get
       Gvishiani to lead a Soviet delegation to the Sussex meeting on “common problems of
       advanced societies.” I described the situation as it now stands—the
       British lead, the widespread response, and the remaining Soviet hesitation over the German
       problem. I told him that we were still anxious not to press for governmental decision, and he
       strongly agreed with this approach. Indeed he pressed for evidence that the Sussex meeting
       was nongovernmental, and I cited the fact that the formal invitation would come from Sussex
       University. I described Zuckerman's current proposal—that the Soviets
       could bring anyone they like as part of their own group (including, by implication, an East
       German) and I suggested that a non-German Eastern country could probably be included if that
       would help. I also said that while our first purpose had been and still was to open a new <pb n="644" xml:id="pg_644" facs="0672"/>line of serious communication with the Soviet Union,
       the project was beginning to take on a life of its own because of the intense interest it
       aroused in many countries, so that I could not tell him that the idea would wait indefinitely
       for the Russians; the Sussex meeting, for example, was now sure to happen. Dobrynin told me
       that he remained personally favorable to the project and would raise the matter both with
       Gvishiani and through official channels.</p>
                        <p>2. After our discussion on the suggested center for the study of common problems of
       advanced societies, the Ambassador surprised me by opening the subject of the Middle East
       with some energy. He said that he thought nothing could be done as long as the U.S. would not
       use its influence on Israel, and when I asked whether the Soviet Union was prepared to use
       its influence on the U.A.R., he not only did not say no, but seemed strongly interested in
       the possibility—not today, but later, we agreed—that the U.S. and the
       Soviet Union might have very private talks to examine the terms that each might be willing to
       support with its friends in the area. We reviewed some of the familiar pieces of the puzzle
       and while <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> did not depart from the basic
       Soviet line, he was less resistant than I expected to my assertion that anyone who wanted the
       Israelis to withdraw <hi rend="italic">from</hi> the Canal would have to say something about
       Israeli shipping <hi rend="italic">through</hi> the Canal. (I do not myself regard the Canal
       as the central element in the problem, but I made that obvious point in reply to his standard
       ploy on withdrawal.) The deposit which the exchange left in mind was that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> would be personally favorable to a policy of
       détente by little steps in this area, but that he was probably acting as a
       disavowable skirmisher. He also remarked that his government did not understand why we
       pressed the question of arms, when in its view the problem of arms was primarily a
       consequence and not a cause of the troubles there. I explained that the problem mattered
       greatly to us because it was an area where Soviet action was forcing U. S. action. He said
       that he himself recognized our problem but that it was hard to explain in Moscow. He also
       asserted with great firmness that his government had no intention of “fishing in
       troubled waters” in the Middle East. I expressed some skepticism, and he refined
       his point; he agreed that his government had interests and purposes of its own in the area,
       but he said it was not seeking military bases or a military position—he said that
       they could easily have much more of that sort of thing if they wanted. I told him I was not a
       believer in the theory that the Soviet Union was trying to outflank <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> by military means in the Middle East. I thought it had more sense. I said that
       I thought the real question was whether Nasser could or would accept any constructive moves.
       On that point <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> mentioned refugees, and then by
       common consent we turned to another subject. But the exchange suggests to me that there may
       be more Soviet readiness for serious talk than I have thought.</p>
                        <pb n="645" xml:id="pg_645" facs="0673"/>
                        <p>3. My exchange with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on the subject of a
       site for Vietnam talks was brief. I opened it myself by saying that I was sure he was a man
       who could understand that Warsaw really was unacceptable from our standpoint. He answered
       that he did now understand this because he had been given a full explanation by <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>. He did not contest the matter at all. I found this
       mildly interesting because in the past <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> has
       nearly always taken just a few minutes to give me the standard brand of argument when his
       government was pressing a particular propaganda position with energy. He then went on to say
       that he thought the people in Hanoi had expected Warsaw to be acceptable to us and that he
       himself would have shared this judgment before our position became clear. I said that I could
       understand this error but that I myself believed that the President's position was
       both persuasive and very firm indeed.</p>
                        <p>I did try to hint to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that the
       unacceptability of Warsaw did not rule out a Communist capital. I did this by saying that in
       my own judgment Moscow would be a much better place than Warsaw. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, as I expected, said that Moscow would be unacceptable for the Soviet
       Union because it would put them a shade too close to the action. I said I could understand
       that.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and I exchanged reminiscences about the
       selection of Glassboro. I raised the subject in order to demonstrate that agreement can be
       reached from quite different starting points in these matters. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> agreed, and told me what a hard time he had had in persuading <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> that the Americans were acting in good faith in
       proposing a military air base at one stage. He said that the Chairman had insisted that no
       one could be serious in proposing anything so obviously inappropriate. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> told me that this first reaction was based on the
       attitude the Soviets take toward their own air bases, to which no one is invited in any
       circumstances. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he had explained that the
       crazy Americans thought their air bases were dandy places for receptions and entertainment of
       all sorts, and eventually the Chairman calmed down and settled for a polite Soviet
       explanation to us that an air base would not be understood by third parties.</p>
                        <p>4. In speaking of Glassboro, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> made an
       interesting comment on the exchange between Bob McNamara and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> on the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>.<note n="2" xml:id="d270fn2">See <ref target="#d231">Document 231</ref>.</note> He said that both he and his Chairman
       had been gravely disappointed by <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s presentation. Given the degree of <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s candor on other subjects, I was much
       struck by the energy and firmness with which he associated himself with his principal on this
       point. He said that in their view <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had said
       nothing more than had already been said publicly by the Americans many times and <pb n="646" xml:id="pg_646" facs="0674"/>had given them nothing concrete in terms of facts and figures
       which would show seriousness. I expressed my surprise, without arguing the point, and said
       that we on our side had been much disappointed by the Chairman's polemical and
       even propagandistic response. I asked <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> whether
       he thought this subject remained one on which there could be really serious private
       exchanges, and he said that he did indeed think so. He said one of the things which had
       bothered them about the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> démarche
       at Glassboro was that it had taken place in rather a large group at luncheon. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> told me that the President had checked with him
       briefly before giving <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> the go-ahead signal,
       and my impression was that he blamed himself for not having tried to steer the President off
       this tack at the time.</p>
                        <p>I myself continue to believe that Bob McNamara made a much more serious effort than
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> apparently give him credit for, but from the point of view of the
       future I think the interesting point is that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
       himself clearly thinks something better can be done on both sides. My own impression is that
       the best way to explore this subject further would be for the President or the Secretary to
       designate either <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> himself or some other
       trusted and highly knowledgeable individual to explore it directly with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. Talks with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> can be wholly secure, and all the evidence suggests that what is
       discussed with him gets reported effectively to the highest levels.</p>
                        <p>5. In informal conversation before lunch, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> displayed a high degree of understanding of election-year politics in
       the United States. He seemed to have a clear and sympathetic appreciation of the positions of
       the leading candidates, and as always I think we are fortunate that a man of his caliber is

                        <p>In a letter to Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> dated May 2, 1968,
       President Johnson proposed that the Soviet and U.S. Governments announce during the debate
       then underway in the United Nations General Assembly over the Non-Proliferation Treaty
       “that they have agreed to begin bilateral negotiations on an agreement to limit
       strategic offensive and defensive missiles.” For text, see <ref target="frus1964-68v11#d237">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1964–1968, volume XI, Document 237</ref>.
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> replied in a June 21 letter to Johnson that
       the Soviets “attach great importance” to “questions
       concerning restraint in the strategic arms race” and they hoped “before
       long it will be possible more concretely to exchange views.” The President
       responded the next day, proposing to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> that they
       jointly announce on July 1—the day the Non-Proliferation Treaty would be opened for
       signature—an “agreement to hold talks on the strategic missile
       problem.” <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> accepted the proposal in
       a June 27 letter to Johnson. For text of their exchanges are June 21, 22, and 27, see ibid.,

                        <p>The negotiations are likely to suffer from the effects of two major Soviet preoccupations.
       Dissent among their own intellectuals and the <pb n="648" xml:id="pg_648" facs="0676"/>recent
       unsettling developments in Eastern Europe have led to sharpened Soviet efforts to guard
       against “hostile foreign influences.”</p>
                        <p>The negotiations will also be further complicated because the expected Soviet negotiators
       are all newcomers to the exchanges program with the United States as a result of
       reorganization in Moscow.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet draft of the proposed agreement would reduce some types of exchanges compared to
       the levels in the last agreement. In two areas of paramount interest to us-exhibits and
       performing arts-the draft avoids specific commitments. (However, contracts for one exchange
       of performing groups have been signed in anticipation of an agreement, and we have had some
       indication that the Soviets intend to move forward with exchanges of other groups.)</p>
                        <p>In the negotiations, our objective will be to preserve the 10-year-old framework for
       reciprocal exchanges and to ensure continuation of some activity in all previous categories
       of exchanges, including performing arts attractions and exhibits. We will insist on the
       principle of a balanced program which reflects the interests of both sides. We will require
       preservation of protective language which assures us reciprocity in these exchanges. Our
       ultimate pressure on the Soviets would be to refuse to conclude an agreement which does not
       meet these requirements.</p>
                        <p>Although we will seek to maintain the same level of exchanges activities as that envisaged
       in the previous agreement, we recognize in the present political climate the need to be
       flexible. Our draft proposes some innovations and expansions, but we expect the Soviets to
       reject any new activities that might be represented as an advance in exchanges or an
       improvement in relations with the United States.</p>
                        <p>I will report to you further before the negotiations are concluded.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>I talked privately with Sec. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> about a trip to the
       Soviet Union. His view is as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. He doubts whether a trip in the present stage of the Vietnam negotiation would be
       acceptable or fruitful.</p>
                        <p>2. If we achieve a negotiating breakthrough-even before Vietnam is wound up-he thinks a
       trip might be acceptable to the Soviet Union and quite useful.</p>
                        <p>3. Therefore, he is inclined to await the outcome of our exchanges with Moscow and events
       in Paris over the next several weeks before proceeding with exploratory discussions with
        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>.</p>

                        <p>1. In after-dinner conversation last night, <persName corresp="#p_KGM1">Kornienko</persName> inquired about status of exchange negotiations. I said Washington was
       very dissatisfied with Soviet draft and I expected instructions to take the matter up with
        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_KGM1">Kornienko</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> occupied with
       Supreme Soviet which would take up foreign affairs today and that he would probably not be
       available until next week. He strongly advised against pursuing this question with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> indicating that firm decision had been taken at highest
       level. Zinchuk in separate conversation with <persName corresp="#p_KBH1">Klosson</persName>
       took same line. When I referred to imbalance in Soviet draft, <persName corresp="#p_KGM1">Kornienko</persName> said that if we wanted to cut out some of the exchanges agreed to, the
       Soviets would be quite willing but in that event they would have some ideas of their own
       about what might be dropped. He emphasized that Soviet draft on balance provided for
       exchanges somewhat above actual level of past year. He specifically mentioned memorandum on
       atomic energy cooperation.</p>
                        <p>2. I must confess I am disappointed at being overruled on this matter. Most we can hope for
       in my view would be very slight improvement in present draft. It seems clear that decision to
       hold exchanges at present level has been taken by Politburo. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> will be unable to change this in any material way without referring back
       to highest level. I doubt that he will do this, but if he does we risk jeopardizing entire
       agreement. Both <persName corresp="#p_KGM1">Kornienko</persName> and Zinchuk indicated that
       there was strong high level opposition to any agreement. I doubt that it is in our interest
       to be suppliant on this issue and we should certainly not threaten to break off negotiations
       unless we are in fact prepared to carry out our threat.</p>
                        <p>3. Although I have strong misgivings about this approach, I shall tomorrow morning ask for
       appointment with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> unless Department, <pb n="651" xml:id="pg_651" facs="0679"/>in light this message, wishes modify my instructions.
       Request comments urgently.<note n="3" xml:id="d275fn3">In telegram 191845 to Moscow, June 27,
        the Department informed Thompson that it was reviewing the situation in light of his message

                        </p>
                        <p>4. I think we should also urgently decide how we are going to play this matter with the
       press. My own view is that we should play it on low key stating we would have liked to have
       had wider exchanges but have agreed on continuing on roughly level carried out last year. If
       Department agrees with this line, the sooner we conclude the agreement the better in order to
       avoid appearance of having received major rebuff.</p>

                        <p>Our negotiations in Moscow for renewal of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> Exchanges Agreement for 1968–69 have reached an impasse on
       two major provisions-exhibits and performing arts groups. Most other portions of the text are
       agreed or are unlikely to pose serious difficulties.</p>
                        <p>In the two programs at issue, the Soviets have insisted that they are unable to continue at
       the levels provided in the last agreement. Specifically, they have offered to exchange three
       performing arts groups against five provided for in the 1966–67 agreement (of which the
       Soviets sent only four, although we sent five), and one exhibit against two in the last
       agreement (of which they sent only one, while we sent two).</p>
                        <p>Soviet reluctance concerning exchanges with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in
       cultural and informational fields is not new, but is now probably increased by <pb n="652" xml:id="pg_652" facs="0680"/>difficulties in the Soviet Union with the intellectual
       community, as well as by Moscow's problems with Czechoslovakia and intrabloc
       solidarity as a whole.</p>
                        <p>Although the Soviets have negotiated in a constructive fashion on a number of other
       portions of the agreement, including a potentially useful arrangement for improved
       distribution of <hi rend="italic">Amerika</hi> magazine, they have stood absolutely firm on
       the two disputed programs.</p>
                        <p>Overall, the prospects for the program under a new agreement, apart from the two in
       dispute, are as follows: General procedural provisions are entirely consistent with our
       position, including protective language to assure full reciprocity in performing arts and
       other programs. Program levels range from those specified in the last agreement downward to
       those actually implemented in 1966–67. Academy of Science and American Council of Learned
       Societies annexes are at pre-existing levels. An annex on cooperation in atomic energy has
       been agreed, ending a Soviet-enforced lapse since 1965.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>, who returned to Moscow June 25,
       has now expressed the view that we cannot expect significant improvement in the Soviet
       position. He has serious doubts as to the utility or desirability of any high-level appeal,
       and believes that we would be well advised to move ahead to conclude an agreement soon if it
       is decided that the terms are acceptable.</p>
                        <p>Unless we are merely to continue talking with little apparent prospect of significant
       improvement in the program for the new agreement, we face a decision among the following
       options:</p>
                        <p>1. To suspend or terminate the negotiations unless the Soviets accept some compromise in
       exhibits and performing arts.</p>
                        <p>2. To accept the Soviet position and conclude an agreement on that basis.</p>
                        <p>3. To accept the Soviet position on performing arts and exhibits, but to invoke
       countervailing reductions from Soviet-proposed levels in exchanges of primary interest to
       them, e.g. technical and agricultural, in order to restore a balance among the ingredients in
       the total program.</p>
                        <p>Clearly the reduced performing arts and exhibits programs will decrease the impact of the
       exchanges program. Nevertheless, I believe that it is in our best interests to continue-even
       at reduced levels-rather than to break off the negotiations. I very much doubt that we can
       force the Soviets to back down from their present position. To terminate the talks now would
       fly in the face of everything you have tried to do with the Russians since Glassboro.</p>
                        <p>If you decide that we should conclude an agreement at the reduced levels, I believe that
       our position would be improved by imposing some countervailing cuts, as suggested in option
       3. We would then be able <pb n="653" xml:id="pg_653" facs="0681"/>to explain the agreement as
       maintaining its normal balance, although at a lower level than we would have liked.</p>
                        <p>After you have given us your decision on how to proceed we will instruct Ambassador
        <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> to make a last effort to obtain some
       modification of the Soviet position. We will ask him to try for Soviet agreement to receive
       our exhibit in up to three more cities, making a total of six (as the proposed agreement now
       reads we can show our exhibit in three cities). If we can get the Soviets to agree to this
       change it would achieve much of the value of two separate exhibits. Even if <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> failed, we could proceed under either option two or
       three.</p>
                        <p>I have talked to Dean Rusk and Len Marks who agree that we should follow option three.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Options:</p>
                        <p>1. Terminate negotiations unless the Soviets accept some compromise.</p>
                        <p>2. Accept the Soviet position and conclude an agreement.</p>
                        <p>3. Accept the Soviet position on performing arts and exhibits, but reduce the levels of
       certain of the exchanges of interest to the Soviets.<note n="2" xml:id="d276fn2">This option

                        <p>The Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons was opened for signature at
       Washington, London, and Moscow on July 1, 1968. At a White House ceremony on July 1, 56
       nations signed the treaty. On July 9 President Johnson transmitted the treaty to the Senate,
       which gave its consent on March 13, 1969, by a vote of 83–15. The treaty, which required the
       ratification of the United States, the United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and 40 other states,
       finally entered into force with the deposit of U.S. ratification at Washington, London, and
       Moscow on March 5, 1970. For text of the treaty, see 21 UST 483 or the Department of State

                        <p>In his remarks at the signing ceremony on July 1, President Johnson announced that
       “agreement has been reached between the Governments of the Union of Soviet
       Socialist Republics and the United States to enter in the nearest future into discussions on
       the limitation and reduction of both offensive strategic nuclear weapons delivery systems and
       systems of defense against ballistic missiles.” For text of the

                        <dateline>
                            <placeName>Washington</placeName>, <date when="1968-07-01">July 1, 1968</date>.</dateline>
                        <p>I met with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> for thirty minutes
       following the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> signing today.</p>
                        <p>I told him that a <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> representative, Mr. Kopytin, had
       called on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName> a few days ago, had referred
       to a certain amount of gossip around Washington that the President might have in mind a
       meeting with Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, and had asked Mr.
       Rostow for any comment on the situation. I added that Mr. Rostow had replied that he himself
       had no information on this matter but that if there was interest in such a matter on the
       Soviet side that there were other channels which would be appropriate to be used to explore
       the possibility. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> commented that
       Mr. Kopytin was not such a channel and was not involved in any way in such matters.</p>
                        <p>I then went on to say that the President has in fact been thinking about the desirability
       of another meeting with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and felt that
       there was much to be gained from it. Specifically, there would be a big meeting of the
       non-nuclear states in August to discuss the implications of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. There would be great advantage if the President and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> could demonstrate before that meeting that the two of
       us are seriously engaged in the matter of offensive and defensive strategic missiles. I said
       that the President would be glad to have a chance to initiate this important subject by a
       first talk with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, during which arrangements
       could be made for follow-up delegations on the two sides to work on the subject. Further, if
       it could be known publicly that this subject was to be a central topic for discussion, it
       could simplify speculation about other topics which might arise. Of course, if the two did
       meet for an informal working session other topics could naturally be brought into the
       conversation.</p>
                        <p>I said that the above pointed toward a meeting toward the latter part of July, if that
       would suit Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s convenience. As
       for a place, the President would be open to suggestions which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> might wish to make. It occurred to us that Geneva might be a possibility
       in view of the presence there of the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>. However, the
       President could, for example, make a non-stop flight to Leningrad if that would be a suitable
       place for a good working session. We understand that there might be some problems about what
       might be described as an official <pb n="656" xml:id="pg_656" facs="0684"/>or state visit but
       that would be something on which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s judgment would be valuable. In any event, I said that the
       exact time and place were matters on which the President was willing to consider Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s suggestions.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> did not raise any objections in
       principle and said that he would be in private personal contact with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. The Ambassador expects to be in Washington about a
       week before returning to Moscow for further participation in a high level review of
       U.S.-Soviet relations. He asked whether the President's schedule would permit him
       to have such a meeting in August or whether the two party conventions would exclude that. I
       said there might be some problem if the President were to undertake such a meeting in the
       middle of one of the two main party conventions. In any event I thought that an earlier date
       would be useful from the point of view of the conference of the non-nuclears scheduled for
       August. I could not derive any tentative Soviet reaction from anything Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said. He obviously did not attempt to comment
       personally before checking with Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Drawing a sharp distinction between the above part of my conversation and the matter of the
       Seaboard Airlines plane in the Kurile Islands, I told him I thought it would be most
       unfortunate if this matter turned out to be a major incident. I said that this was an
       instance of “unearned dividends” in our business, and that I much
       regretted that on Saturday of all days some American navigator and pilot apparently strayed
       off course. I told him that if this were the case, he could have my sincere expressions of
       regret right now. He said that he did not think this matter would prove to be too difficult
       but that he had had no instructions from Moscow. Whether his relatively relaxed and
       optimistic attitude will be reflected in Moscow, one cannot of course say.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then asked me about the prospects for the election. I told him that the
       present indications are that Vice President <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName>
       and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> have a very strong lead in their
       respective parties but that I have been advising all of my friends in the diplomatic corps to
       add a final sentence in any report on our elections: “But don't forget
       that 1968 is a year of political surprises in the United States.” He smiled and
       said that he has been doing just that to Moscow but that Moscow is very anxious to have
       something more solid.</p>
                        <p>He added, <hi rend="italic">very much off the record</hi>, that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> has approached the Soviet Government on three occasions
       about a visit to Moscow following the Republican Convention. He said that they had simply not
       replied to the first two inquiries but now have a third inquiry in front of them which they
       are thinking about. I told him that I was not in a position at this moment to offer any
       advice on that subject but did point <pb n="657" xml:id="pg_657" facs="0685"/>to the habit of
       many candidates to want to make a “grand tour” of foreign capitals and
       that this has presented problems for busy leaders of other Governments.</p>
                        <p>He then expressed interest in whether Senator McCarthy would go to Paris. I told him that
       we just didn't know, that Senator McCarthy has a passport and would probably be
       admitted to France. I also pointed out that such a visit would be very strange and not in
       accord with long-standing American constitutional and diplomatic practice. I said that
       Senator McCarthy might succeed only in misleading the representatives of Hanoi to which he
       assented.</p>

       (reported in State 195609),<note n="2" xml:id="d279fn2">Dated July 2. (Ibid., FT
        1/1/FR)</note> and to indicate that he would soon return to Paris to consult with his
       government and take his summer vacation. He was interested in having the
       Secretary's views on current relations with the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <pb n="658" xml:id="pg_658" facs="0686"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador referred to the memorandum published by the Soviet Government on July
        1,<note n="3" xml:id="d279fn3">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Current Digest of the Soviet
         Press,</hi> July 24, 1968, pp. 3–4.</note> following the signing of the non-proliferation
       treaty, and asked what our reaction was to it. The Secretary said that in publishing their
       list of nine measures “on an end to the arms race and on disarmament in the near
       future” the Russians had merely cleaned out the refrigerator—full of
       proposals they had tabled at one time or another in the past. He said we also will have a
       list of proposals, but the concrete development at present will be the missile talks. The
       heart of this matter will be in bilateral talks, focusing on the U.S. and Soviet military
       establishments, in the first instance. He anticipated that there would also be discussion on
       this subject at Geneva, and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would be consulted as we
       move along.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the missile question is both very complicated and very simple. The
       problem is one of avoiding tremendous new expenditures on both sides, which could only have,
       as an end result, the effect of maintaining the existing balance of nuclear deterrence. How
       to solve this simple problem, on the other hand, is a highly complicated technical question.
       We have wondered why the Soviets responded to our initiative; in the best case, they may have
       reached the same conclusion we did, that no significant advantage is possible for either
       side; in the worst case, they may feel that a gesture, without real substance, would help
       influence hesitant countries to sign the non-proliferation treaty. The Secretary said that we
       will proceed on the basis that the Soviets are prepared to deal with the problem
       seriously.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador wondered whether this development indicated the possibility of a general
       improvement in relations with the Soviet Union. The Secretary replied that improvements had
       taken place on an eclectic basis, not across-the-board. While we have moved ahead with the
       non-proliferation treaty, two space treaties, a civil air agreement and a consular
       convention, our relations have not improved regarding Berlin and Viet-Nam, and our ideologies
       remain far apart. The Soviets appear to be suspicious of
       “bridge-building.” We are trying to move ahead on a pragmatic basis, on
       matters that we believe will be of mutual advantage to both countries. We remain hopeful that
       in due course we will secure Congressional agreement in the area of trade expansion with
       Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, with authority to extend most-favored-nation treatment
       to those countries.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the Berlin situation, the Secretary said that he found a preoccupation in
       Germany, during his brief visit there, over what might come next rather than over the
       measures already taken. The Soviets tell us that the measures undertaken by the East Germans
       constitute <pb n="659" xml:id="pg_659" facs="0687"/>only a change in form, not a challenge to
       Allied access, and that they do not wish to increase tensions over Berlin. The Secretary said
       that the measures are not consistent with Soviet understandings with the Allies, and that we
       must make clear to the Soviets that this is getting into dangerous country. Both we and the
       Soviets could do without another Berlin crisis. The impression we have is that the present
       measures were instituted in part because of concern over developments in Czechoslovakia. In
       this connection, the Secretary noted that in his public statement in Bonn on June 26<note n="4" xml:id="d279fn4">For text, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin,</hi>
        July 15, 1968, pp. 74–75.</note> he had suggested that the Soviets and Eastern Europeans are
       becoming a little frightened of peaceful coexistence, which in the long run could undermine
       the economic, social and political systems of the Communist states.</p>

                        <p>On February 27 I sent you the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> draft for a new exchanges
       agreement with the Soviet Union for 1968–69. Negotiations began in Moscow June 3, and have
       now been completed. I enclose a copy of the agreed text.<note n="2" xml:id="d280fn2">Not
        attached.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The new agreement retains the structure, general and procedural provisions of the last
       agreement, including protective language to insure reciprocity in performing arts and other
       programs. We were able to include a potentially valuable new provision for distribution of
        <hi rend="italic">Amerika</hi> magazine to visitors at American exhibits. The Soviets also
       agreed to numerous editorial improvements in the text.</p>

                                <ref target="#d276">Document 276</ref>.</note> the Soviets insisted during the negotiations
       that they would continue the exchanges of performing arts groups and exhibits only at reduced
       levels. Since then we pressed for, and the Soviets agreed to, an increase to six in the
       number of cities at which exhibits may be shown. Since the last agreement provided for two
       exhibits in three cities each, the new provision gives our exhibit exposure equal to that
       obtained by both sent in 1966–67.</p>
                        <p>In performing arts, the Soviets insisted to the end that they were able to send only three
       groups to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in 1968–69 (against four actually sent and
       five provided for in 1966–67). The new agreement, thus, provides for the exchange of three
       performing arts groups in the next 18 months. In exchanges of individual performing artists,
       the new agreement contains tighter reciprocity provisions which may help to increase the
       number of American artists visiting the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Other programs are continued at levels either approximately equal to those provided for
       1966–67 or ranging downward to the level actually implemented during that period. To a
       degree, we limited levels in technical exchanges in order to preserve the overall internal
       balance of the agreement.</p>

        author “a thoughtful and hardheaded fellow.” In a July 16 memorandum

                            <item>Some Signs of Change in Soviet Policy</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. Signs have appeared recently that Soviet policy may be moving in new directions on some
       key issues. Having responded for the last several years to approaches on Vietnam only by a
       willingness to provide Hanoi's telephone number, the Soviets have now begun some
       diplomatic activity in the anterooms of the Paris talks. For the first time since the
       Arab-Israeli war a year ago, there are hints that Moscow's hard pro-Arab line may
       give way to a more flexible diplomacy and some parallel efforts with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. And, of course, the American offer of a year and a half ago to
       discuss the control of strategic weapons has now been taken up. Assuming that these are valid
       and significant signs, some obvious questions arise: Why? Why now? What range of movement on
       these or other issues is likely?</p>
                        <p>2. The consideration that might figure in a shift of Soviet policy on such issues would no
       doubt be multiple and complex. But more than likely, given their intense preoccupation with
       tactics, the Soviets have in mind some inter-connection when they become active
       simultaneously in several apparently unrelated matters. There has not been, however, any
       general improvement in the climate of Soviet-American relations, Moscow's usual
       way of accenting the positive when it wants to get some diplomatic business done. The harsh
       attacks on the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> which have marked the entire period of the
       Vietnam war continue. The suggestion is that Moscow is prepared for bargaining, but that the
       terms will be hard and that there will be no movement on matters important to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> unless it makes concessions sought by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on others. Among the three subjects listed above, the Middle
       East and strategic <pb n="662" xml:id="pg_662" facs="0690"/>arms control are those on which
       the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> has been pressing Moscow to be more accommodating.
       Presumably the Soviets expect the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to move toward
       concessions on Vietnam.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Soviet Aims and Tactics on Vietnam</p>
                        <p>3. Support for Hanoi and its campaign against the South has had a high priority in Soviet
       policy since the fall of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in 1964. While
       this course may have been entered upon then in the mistaken belief that Hanoi was nearing
       success, it has been persisted in at some cost and risk. Probably the main motive has been to
       sustain Moscow's claim to leadership of the Communist movement in the face of
       China's bitter attacks and deviant tendencies in others. At the same time, it was
       recognized that the widespread opposition to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> role in
       Vietnam provided opportunity for Soviet propaganda and diplomacy to work effectively against
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> influence in many other areas. Evidently, such
       possibilities as there might have been for constructive developments in Soviet-American
       relations did not weigh as heavily in Soviet calculations.</p>
                        <p>4. The Soviet leaders have probably always believed that the war could only end in a
       negotiated settlement, and they probably now hope that the Paris talks will develop in such a
       way as to bring that result at the earliest feasible date. Tactically, Hanoi's
       move to the negotiating table also frees Moscow to begin at last to talk with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> on Vietnam. That this is happening does not mean that Moscow is
       now prepared to play a mediating role, however, much less to bring any sort of pressure on
       Hanoi to settle for less than it wants. Soviet diplomatic activity so far is only parallel
       and supporting, and appears at every step to be coordinated with the Vietnamese. This will
       probably continue to be true, for two very substantial reasons. First, the Soviets clearly do
       not have significant influence on Hanoi's policy. Second, an attempt to put
       pressure on Hanoi to agree to some “compromise” solution short of its
       desires would play into China's hands and probably cost Moscow its entire
       investment and effort in North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>5. Thus the outcome Moscow will be working for will be one satisfactory to the Hanoi
       leadership. If Hanoi wins control of the South, and perhaps eventually of Laos and Cambodia
       as well, the Soviets will expect their repute among Vietnamese and other Communists to grow,
       and they will expect to increase their influence in Southeast Asia generally, at the expense
       of both the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and China. They do not equate success for Hanoi
       with an enlarged Chinese threat to that area. On the other hand, if Hanoi feels obliged to
       accept an unfavorable outcome, the Soviets will accept this also, though in this case they
       would expect Chinese influence in Hanoi to grow at their expense. The ideal solution from
       Moscow's point of view would be one favorable to Hanoi, one that resulted from a
       negotiated settlement the Soviets could claim <pb n="663" xml:id="pg_663" facs="0691"/>to
       have helped bring about, and perhaps also, if Hanoi were willing, a solution phased over some
       period of time, on the ground that this might limit complications and dangers in
       Soviet-American relations.</p>
                        <p>6. The indicated course for the Soviets, therefore, is to induce the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to move toward acceptance of terms agreeable to Hanoi. This has been their line
       all along, but the fact that negotiations are now in train authorizes them to take
       initiatives which Hanoi's previously rigid attitude precluded. If the Soviets
       still cannot bargain on their own account over a Vietnam settlement, Hanoi will have no
       objection and perhaps even counts on the Soviets exercising leverage on the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> by opening up other areas of negotiation.</p>
                        <p>7. It is probably no accident, therefore, that the Soviets chose the present moment to
       signal an interest in moving with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> on the Middle East
       and in talking about control of strategic arms. In making this point it does not need to be
       implied that the Soviets will only make motions on these subjects and will not talk
       seriously. In fact, in respect of both there are good reasons for believing that the Soviets
       think the moment has come when there would be advantage to them in trying to deal with the
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. The opportunity to bring these subjects together with
       Vietnam perhaps only gave an added incentive.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Soviet Policy in the Middle East</p>
                        <p>8. Since the Arab-Israeli war in 1967 the Soviets have aligned themselves rigorously with
       the Arab cause. They have resupplied the arms lost and in their diplomacy and propaganda have
       worked for a settlement which would at least deprive Israel of the fruits of its military
       victory. In some part, this effort was intended to recoup the loss of prestige suffered by
       the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> when it encouraged the Arab belligerency prior to
       June 1967 and then stood idly by as its clients were humiliated. The Soviets probably now
       think that they have largely reestablished their position in the radical Arab states. But for
       many complicated reasons, some having to do with Soviet interests in Europe, both East and
       West, Moscow has no desire to align itself with Arab intransigence aimed at the destruction
       of the Israeli state. Its problem is to preserve its influence with the Arabs while avoiding
       a full commitment to Arab aims.</p>
                        <p>9. If the present stalemate continues, the Israelis will simply stand fast on their
       territorial gains and the Arabs will feel that they have no recourse but to look to another
       round of war. They will demand more and more arms and probably direct Soviet support as well
       in an eventual showdown, perspectives which cannot be congenial to Moscow. The Soviets
       probably now think that they have an interest in joining with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to bring the Middle East hotbed under some degree of control. What they would
       want from the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is pressure on Israel to <pb n="664" xml:id="pg_664" facs="0692"/>moderate its claims for a settlement. In return, they might
       hold out the possibility of an agreement the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> has long
       sought—one limiting arms sales in the region. The Soviets would be particularly
       pleased if under such an agreement the US could be persuaded to withhold further supply of
       high performance aircraft to Israel. In any case, they would expect that the prospect of
       parallel action to contain the dangers in this area would elicit considerable <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> interest. And, they might think, this could have some bearing on
       what the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would be willing to do about a settlement in
       Vietnam.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Soviet Approach to Control of Strategic Arms</p>
                        <p>10. The long delay in acceptance of the American offer to discuss the control of strategic
       weapons was probably owing to several reasons. Responses to the repeated American initiatives
       in the arms control field have always been marked by extreme caution and suspicion, and on so
       central an issue as the control of strategic weapons the resistance of conservative forces,
       both within and outside of the military establishment, was probably formidable. Moreover,
       until very recently the Soviets have been in the position of catching up, at least in numbers
       of land-based <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s. The present moment, when
       the Soviets have probably come to have real confidence in their possession of an assured
       destruction capability, and before the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> advances to new
       developments which could unhinge this equilibrium once more, probably seems the most
       opportune to entertain measures to arrest competition in this field. The Soviets are probably
       not fully confident of their ability to keep pace should the race continue, and, of course,
       they must be deeply conscious of the economic burdens of continuing.</p>
                        <p>11. Moscow's willingness to begin talks does not signify a firm intention to
       strive for an agreement. In the initial phase, the Soviets will probably confine themselves
       to probing the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> position. If and when they get down to
       serious dealing, the process, given the critical nature of the issues, will be hard and
       prolonged. But, because of their intensely political approach to arms control issues, the
       Soviets will see certain advantages in this very process. For one thing, they are aware that
       prolonged negotiation about arms control measures is itself a form of arms control, since
       some inhibition would be imposed on new <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> programs. For
       another, they would hope that one result of the negotiations, even if no agreement issues
       from them, will be that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> concedes in principle that the
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is and should be recognized as an equal power, with a
       full right to strategic parity, however that may be defined in detail. This alone the Soviets
       would see as a considerable political achievement, with favorable implications for the
       position of the Soviet regime at home, for its claims to leadership in the Communist world,
       and for its standing and influence as a world power.</p>
                        <pb n="665" xml:id="pg_665" facs="0693"/>
                        <p>12. And, of course, to engage the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in negotiations for a
       goal—significant arms control agreements—to which American opinion and
       policy are deeply committed, would, the Soviets could calculate, have an influence on how the
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> appraised what was at stake in one or another form of
       Vietnam settlement. It is not that there could be any direct trade-offs; this would be too
       crude. But the belief that Soviet-American relations were at last on a constructive course
       could have a far-reaching effect, especially on general American opinion, in making
       concessions in Vietnam seem more acceptable. It is a classic Soviet mode in negotiating close
       issues to hold out the promise of broader benefits to follow.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">In Sum</p>
                        <p>13. This reading of the signs which point to some new directions in Soviet policy on
       certain major issues clearly does not forecast any very deep change. There are good tactical
       reasons why the Soviets should now move toward some degree of tacit collaboration with the
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in the Middle East, and should take up the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> offer to discuss the control of strategic weapons. The
       possibility of influencing the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> course in the negotiations
       on Vietnam by these moves is an added tactical consideration of great weight. In other areas,
       however, Soviet purposes will require that tension and hostility be sustained. This is
       particularly true in Eastern Europe where the Soviet hegemony is under challenge and where
       “the threat of aggressive <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
       imperialism” is more than ever needed. Even in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> itself, the leadership apparently feels, certain unwholesome tendencies and a
       kind of ideological unsteadiness preclude any broad relaxation of tensions with the US. Thus
       the signs of change considered here presage, in the intentions of the Soviet leaders, no very
       far-reaching effects for Soviet-American relations. But then the Soviet leaders have not been
       uniformly successful in forecasting and controlling the consequences of every new turn in the
       play.</p>

       Czechoslovakia is still hot. You could get caught up in that and I'm just afraid
       it would be difficult for you to extricate yourself. You could have a talk with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and the day you talked with him Soviet troops could
       move on Czechoslovakia or the day after you left, troops could move in Czechoslovakia. It
       would be, they'd be tied together in some way, whether that would suit <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s attitude or not, I don't know.
       I think that we have to be careful about the reasons why the President was seeing <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> at this time. Is it because the President has a new
       plan that he is taking to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> vis-á-vis
       Vietnam? Is there something new he wants to take to him? Is it because the
       President's concerned about the Middle East—some development there? Is
       he concerned about <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>? You know, there's so
       much cooking right now. As far as starting off with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> on a discussion of strategic limitation and ultimate reduction, I
       don't know. Right at this time, Mr. President, I wonder whether that's
       advisable. These are going to be long, difficult, exceedingly complex negotiations. Whether
       the President and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> can do anything much at the
       very beginning of it, I don't know. I think that the general approach would be,
       well—I just wonder what they can do about it. And I think we have to be
       careful—the time that the President selects to see <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. I would hope that there'd be time when we didn't
       have a situation quite as inflammable as it is. I'm thinking of the
       Czechoslovakian problem. I think that's a terribly difficult problem. I know we
       can't get in it. I feel some concern that we can. Czechoslovakia is supposedly a
       free country and they can be under the heel just like Hungary was. I don't know
       for instance whether somebody <pb n="667" xml:id="pg_667" facs="0695"/>might decide to bring
       this up in the Security Council in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>-Czechoslovakia.
       Maybe some member of the Security Council could decide to bring it up. That would tend to
       exacerbate it. So, a second point I'm making is to sound a note of basic caution
       about going to see <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> right at this time. I think
       it must be watched with great care. The third point I have—after Dean left
       Saturday afternoon, I just noted down thoughts that I had, just in my own
       handwriting—I've not given them even to the girl. The third point
       I'd like to make has to do with the Convention.</p>
                        <p>[Here follow 3 pages concerning the President's possible attendance at the
       Democratic National Convention in August.]</p>
                        <p>[<persName corresp="#p_CCM1">Clifford</persName>:] There's another little
       element there. We don't know when the North Vietnamese are gong to launch their
       next series of attacks. If they chose to and the President saw <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> in early August or some time through that period there or some time in
       August, that might be the time that they'd choose to launch attacks. I
       don't know. I think, if I were they, I'd maybe be on the lookout for
       some situation of that kind. They would get some notice in advance. There always has to be
       some word in advance to the American public and to the press generally that such a meeting is
       to be held. There'd have to be some advanced announcement. There again is an
       opportunity for embarrassment to the President. This is very prominent in my mind, as I look
       ahead at this time, Mr. President, with the condition existing in Czechoslovakia, with
       existing in Vietnam—we're waiting for the other shoe to drop over
       there—I can see more danger in a visit with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> at this time than I can see benefit. Now I think there will come a time
       when the President can see <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. Right now it just
       seems to me that it's tempting fate too severely.</p>
                        <p>President: What time do you see it come?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM1">Clifford</persName>: Well, I think there'll be a
       resolution of the problem in Czechoslovakia. These things don't go on
       indefinitely. The President is still President. Let's see, August, September,
       October, November, December, you're still President for six months, until the 20th
       of January. That's almost six months off. I don't know, it could be a
       week.</p>
                        <p>President: You think it would probably be all right to have meetings in November and
       December?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM1">Clifford</persName>: It wouldn't bother me a bit. It
       wouldn't bother me a bit. You're going right on being President and
       you're not bothering with politics. The fact that there's some new man
       or something, that wouldn't bother me a particle. I think in maybe a week, could
       be a week, Czechoslovakia would be resolved one way or another. Could be two weeks, or take
       three weeks, but I think it's going to be resolved, that this thing has gotten so
       acute now, so inflammatory, that I think they're going to lance this abscess one
       way or the other and I think it will be out of the <pb n="668" xml:id="pg_668" facs="0696"/>way. Now, I think that we will all learn during the month of August whether
       there's going to be another series of attacks from the enemy in Vietnam. Maybe it
       will come and maybe it won't, and I think we get that out of the way so that that
       doesn't get too involved in it. It wouldn't disturb me at all if the
       talks on strategic weapons control were to start at some other level. It's going
       to go on for some time. I don't know that it has too much significance in having
       it started by <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and the President and
       I'm not even sure that it's particularly valuable to just confine it to
       that at the starting. I think that the President when he goes to see, or arranges to see
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, under proper circumstances in which
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s comfortable I would hope the two
       of you would be able to sit down and cover the entire mosaic of our problems. An announcement
       could be made ahead of time to that effect and something after it could come out. Right now I
       believe that if I were <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> with this real nose
       bleed on my hands with Czechoslovakia I think almost the last person I would want to see
       right now would be President Johnson.</p>
                        <p>President: Yes, I think there is something to that. I'm not necessarily trying
       to help him though.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Well, Mr. President, I'd like to
       comment very briefly.</p>
                        <p>President: Let me comment on <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Clark</persName>'s
       thing. I think there is no reason why we have to act until the Czechoslovakia situation is
       cleared. As I indicated, that's number one. If it's two weeks,
       that's another matter. I would expect maybe it wouldn't be that long. I
       don't know. I can't tell. But I don't think it's
       essential. We don't say that I don't think that the President and
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> sit down together. We have though for four
       years urged this step upon them and we finally got them to agree now that there will be a
       meeting within a month or a month and a half. I would like to forthrightly respond to that
       and accept it and give him my views of what ought to happen. And I think there may be some
       merit in the four days of the Convention there, waiting until it's over with, I
       don't care. And it may be that he won't want to start at this level.
       I'd rather think he wouldn't, although I would like to because I think
       that that would be the way. But if not, if you want to modify that part of it if that is
       a—you might say, or at the Foreign Minister level. One or the other of us ought to
       start it off. And so I'm willing to rewrite the letter and use his
       phrase—not ours.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Month, month and a half.</p>
                        <p>President: Yes, and I'm willing to also add that if this doesn't suit
       you, why we'd be glad for the Foreign Ministers to start it off. We do think
       it's of sufficient importance. The very first proposal we made to the Soviet Union
       we insisted on time and date and place and subject. There is so much that is pending that
       needs the attention of both countries. What I'm terribly afraid of
       is—I'm afraid by our sitting with our <pb n="669" xml:id="pg_669" facs="0697"/>hands in our pockets, just merrily, merrily going along, just reacting to all
       of their initiatives and their propaganda and their party line, that we just finally catch
       ourselves signing off which we have been doing most of the time and I think we're
       likely to be doing it again. I think we'll be having a Council meeting here in a
       week or so and everybody will pretty well agree in general, well, we ought to cut out
       something else we're doing in deference to these folks. That is what I am fearful
       of.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Well, I agree with <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Clark</persName>. I think you do, too, about the possible connection between this
       Czechoslovakian business. I think, myself, that the chances are—</p>
                        <p>President: We wouldn't have waited today if it hadn't agreed on
       that.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: That's right. That's right.
       I think we're likely to see some sort of answer on the Czech business before
       then.</p>
                        <p>President: I think so.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: We did put in this draft: “If the
       general situation permits.” That's a phrase that covers the Czech
       business in our minds. If things really start in Czechoslovakia we'd just
       ourselves pull back even if <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> accepted this.</p>
                        <p>President: That is what that was intended to do. But I don't think that we even
       need to dispatch the letter until we see a little clearer than I do now. I said that last
       weekend and I didn't ask for this meeting today.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: I asked for it. [Unintelligible.] What such a
       meeting would be about. I think that we can make it pretty clear that it is about offensive
       and defensive missiles. That is a question which everybody knows the President's
       worked on very hard and worked on personally. He tried very hard at Glassboro to get these
       talks started. He's also worked hard on the non-proliferation treaty which has in
       it an obligation on the part of the nuclear powers to get going and negotiate in good faith
       about elimination of the arms race. So from that point of view it seems to me that it would
       militate in favor of the President's launching these discussions.
       There's another factor and that is that, <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Clark</persName>, you may not like this one particularly. I think if the President
       initiated the discussions, this would be a sign to what General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> called the military industrial complex that, Goddamn it, getting an
       agreement to limit offensive and defensive missiles is the national policy of the United
       States. We want people to think about how you do it and not think about how you'll
       avoid doing it. Looking ahead you look at these tens of billions that are going down this rat
       hole if we don't find an answer to it, you see. So there's an internal
       commitment involving the President's study. Now there is danger when the court of
       last resort gets into session, and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> could turn
       up there with demands on Berlin or something. After all <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> did drop the Berlin crisis in President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s lap when they met in Vienna. <pb n="670" xml:id="pg_670" facs="0698"/>This did not happen in Glassboro partly because <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was over here at the United Nations on the Middle East frying some fish
       of his own at that time. And therefore, this was not racked up. There's a little
       danger. I think it is not as great now as it might have been earlier that that would happen.
       So this is why—subject to Czechoslovakia—I myself come down on the
       balanced judgment that there would be real merit in the two meetings if it could be done
       under the appropriate circumstances.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM1">Clifford</persName>: I find no disagreements with that, Dean. I
       think that President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s meeting in
       Vienna with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was a calamity.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: It was.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM1">Clifford</persName>: Boy, it was a real zero from President
        <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s standpoint. Now I think
       conditions have changed. I think that the Soviets have shown an inclination to find some
       basis of cooperation with us. That very interesting sentence in the last letter of <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> that we will both find as we get into this that a
       savings can be effected, a very substantial [Unintelligible.]</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: I would be for the President's having
       a chance to talk with him quite informally—without pretending that is the main
       subject—about Vietnam and about the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM1">Clifford</persName>: I would have no difficulty with that.</p>
                        <p>President: You know originally I thought we ought to say that, and I took it out.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>President: This is not the only subject. This refers to—</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: It will also give us a chance to discuss quietly
       and informally some of the problems or tensions to which you referred.</p>
                        <p>President: That just polished up the very [inaudible] three matters they wanted to talk
       about but also left us a getting out place even on Czechoslovakia or any other developments
       after it was set. And I don't think I would want to specify that I would not want
       to attend a meeting. Now, I don't see that this would do the damage to the
       Democratic Party that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Clark</persName> does. I have a different
       viewpoint. I think it's the best thing that we could do for the Democratic Party,
       whoever is nominated at that time. I don't think we necessarily need to go at that
       specific moment, but I think most of them will be pretty glad that we're having a
       meeting. I would just leave it more in his hands on the month to month and a half basis.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: All right.</p>
                        <p>President: But I think we could do that after you see what—.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM1">Clifford</persName>: I would agree, too, that it would be of
       great benefit to the Democratic Party if it didn't take place on those very days
       that they were having their Convention.</p>
                        <pb n="671" xml:id="pg_671" facs="0699"/>
                        <p>President: Well their Convention is going to have all the television every hour. This
       meeting is not going to be taking much of it. And I would doubt that he would set the
       meeting. I would just leave it and say anytime within the month or month and half he
       mentioned, it would be agreeable with us. I'd be pretty agreeable to hear
       suggestions.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: All right.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM1">Clifford</persName>: Does he have in mind that the President
       would like to start it off personally with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>,
       because he said nothing about that in his last reply. And the President I think said nothing
       about that in this one. Does he?</p>
                        <p>President: Yes.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM1">Clifford</persName>, Oh, he does. Well I see. I didn't
       notice it.</p>
                        <p>President: He understood at Glassboro that we were pressing on this very hard. A little
       history would help us. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> wrote me in December
       '63 a rather broad long letter and we responded January the 16th,
        '64<note n="3" xml:id="d282fn3">See <ref target="#d1">Document 1</ref>.</note> in
       which we discussed the perils of armament in the world and the two powers poised at each
       other and how much it would cost us and how much good could be done if we could only approach
       this problem of disarmament and particularly if we could have some agreement that would bring
       about the non-proliferation treaty. This was number one on the list and we listed a series of
       reductions in our armed strength and in our future investments in armaments. And we stuck it
       right up to him and said that we very much want to do this and then we followed that with a
       series of specific moves where we reduced our atomic reactors and asked him to do likewise
       and he held off to the last moment until ours was announced. I was actually at the microphone
       speaking when he notified us that he would issue an announcement at the same time.<note n="4" xml:id="d282fn4">Presumably a reference to the President's announcement on April
        20, 1964, of a reduction in the production of enriched uranium. For more information, see

                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1964–1968, vol. XI, Document 25</ref>.</note> We
       suggested 2 o'clock on Tuesday. I started speaking at 1:45 and we
       hadn't heard from him and about 1:55 why they brought us a note that he was going
       to announce it at 2:00, right at the last minute. He went out and our people, we pursued this
       up until we went in there with our bombing in '65 and things kind of tapered off.
       At Glassboro it heated up again, very strong. And we took the initiative and just almost
       wrestled him to have the meeting and said anytime, anywhere we'll send our man to
       Moscow or we'll meet in Geneva or we'll come back to Glassboro.
       We'll do anything, but this <pb n="672" xml:id="pg_672" facs="0700"/>we must do.
       We thought we got a tentative, implied acceptance then and we thought it would be rather
       soon. He got back and subsequently came along and implied it again. What did he say in that
       language when we got back? We announced it the day Bobby Kennedy made a speech and we
       didn't call him up and find out he was going to speak the same day or not so they
       charged us with bad motives. You remember that don't you?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Yes. [Unintelligible.]</p>
                        <p>President: There was some indication that they would meet with us again but they never
       would set a date. So we have kept shoving 'em all during that period. Now
       we've come along and he has said yes a month or month to six weeks. Now if we
       don't want to talk or if we are hesitant to talk or if we want to just let it go
       through the regular channels of Bill Foster at Geneva, that's one thing.
       That's now my view. It hasn't been for four years and I think this is
       most important thing we could ever do.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Mr. President, I tried to get <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> to accept <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> in Moscow the following Wednesday after Glassboro. Could be there next
       [unintelligible]—can't come then. Well then name a date. Pressed them
       very hard on this.</p>
                        <p>President: Now, it's been a year, during that time he's put off and
       put off during that year. During that time I've had to go up with my budget and
       I've had to put the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> in the budget to stick it,
       hold firm and not weaken, with everybody wanting to shimmy a little bit. And then when he got
       up, a lot want to run away from it after it gets up there, as you observed with Symington,
       and so forth, the fight that went on in the Senate. And now he's still holding
       back one Goddamn year and not doing anything and finally when the Senate vote gets out of the
       way and it looks like we are going ahead, and we hold out the hand of peace here but the hand
       of strength here so we're going to go on, we don't want to do this,
       we'd like to save this 50 billion that the two of us are spending, but
       he's just got no sense at all. We'll go on. We are not going to let you
       destroy us. We're not going to let you be defended and us not defended. Then he
       comes up and says I'll see you in a month or month and a half. That's
       where we are. Then we say well we can't do it because we've got a
       Convention. That doesn't appeal to me. I'd go right back to him and say
       that you suggest a month to a month and a half and Geneva is agreeable and a month to a month
       and a half is agreeable and we would suggest it on this level and if you're not
       satisfied, if you don't want to do it on that level, well then I'll
       arrange for the Foreign Ministers.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: All right.</p>
                        <p>President: And then I'd let him say it. And if he picks August 25th I
       wouldn't be worried. I don't think he will, but I'm sure
       that we can <pb n="673" xml:id="pg_673" facs="0701"/>so arrange the agenda that we could get
       our man nominated and the American people would have all the Democratic Convention they want.
       I think they will have. I think it will be the thing that is uppermost. We talk a lot with
       these folks. You have met with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> a good many
       times. I have met with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and it hasn't turned the world upside down.
       We know, just like Averell and <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> meeting with them
       over there. What I'm really worried about is that they're more in
       command of our forces than I am. That's what really troubles me. These damned
       cables coming in like that. Because I read this record and I see these pictures and I see
       Javits get up and I see Morgan get up and I see all of them come up and I see the New York
       Times editorial and it just fits in to this whole damn faction. If I hadn't been
       watching it for four or five years I wouldn't be worried about it, but
       it's just not accidental. And I don't want to get hung on the rack. I
       just don't want to get caught on it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: All right.</p>
                        <p>President: I want to make it so firm and loud that I don't want my people to
       serve that up to me and then have <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> come along
       here and saying, well as you know I thought this way.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: They can well concentrate on trying to get
       another private meeting and get an answer from Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>President: I think we'd better show them that just a few speeches and pressure
       are not going to do it. They are beginning to think we're jelly and
       we'll do it and I don't understand why he'd send this wire
       after we told him how we felt about it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: The trouble is that negotiators
       habitually—</p>
                        <p>President: It's not negotiation, hell, this is—</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Get actions to take the next step.
       That's one of the problems about American negotiators, they're always
       in a little bit more of a hurry than the other side. I think they also—maybe
       Averell is making some judgments about politics here at home.</p>
                        <p>President: A good deal and it looks like a good deal of it in Vietnam—the battle
       strategy too.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Mr. President, on the longer-range negotiations
       for this thing I'd just like to put it in the back of your mind. I think <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Clark</persName> and I would agree that the two key people from our
       respective Departments might be <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brown</persName>. He's
       very knowledgeable in this field.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM1">Clifford</persName>: Harold.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Harold Brown and Butch Fisher, who works in the
        <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>. I think we also feel there ought to be a principal
       negotiator on top of them. Maybe in the State Department. A man from the Defense Department
       would be the principal negotiator on disarmament. I think it would be a mistake, and the
       Pentagon would feel this even more <pb n="674" xml:id="pg_674" facs="0702"/>strongly than I,
       for <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> to be the number one fellow on this particular
       subject. Now one possibility would be to bring Tommy Thompson out of Moscow for these talks
       in Geneva, let him be there for three or four weeks for the first round. Then
       we're bound to close off the talks for awhile and study each other's
       position in more detail. Tommy is not doing a great deal in Moscow these days and he would be
       in a position to follow up. So he would be one possibility. Another possibility would be,
       that is after the Foreign Ministers' review [unintelligible] get through with it,
       another possibility would be Chip Bohlen. I think in terms of negotiation of this kind of
       thing, Tommy Thompson would be, in some respects, a more competent negotiator because
       he's very familiar with all these matters having worked with the Pentagon for
       years in that Deputy job over in my shop. But I just wanted to mention that to you, because
       other names may occur to you to head up the delegation but we would suggest a head of the
       delegation plus <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brown</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Fisher</persName> and their respective staffs.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM1">Clifford</persName>: We have to bring the Joint Chiefs along on
       this one, as you would know. They'd be very important and our record must be
       absolutely clear. They feel the responsibility, of course, as we all do, protecting the
       security of this country. They, I was telling Dean Saturday afternoon, they paw the air when
       Bill Foster's name is mentioned. They think Bill is very soft and very
       fuzzy-headed. Dean said, very correctly, well, anybody who'd be head of <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> would be viewed in that light by the Joint Chiefs of
       Staff.</p>
                        <p>President: Just one second. [The President left the room.]</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: My guess is that the Russians will buy a Foreign
       Ministers' like a flash and so the problem disappears. The Convention will prevent
       it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM1">Clifford</persName>: You mean the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> and the Joint Chiefs of Staff problem?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: No, I say if we go back to the Russians and say
       that I could see <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> myself, if not the Foreign
       Minister, I think the Russians will buy a Foreign Ministers' like a shot.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM1">Clifford</persName>: [whispering]: I don't think
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> will see the President now with all the
       difficulties, because—</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: I don't see much of a meeting between
       the two after November with the President-elect in the wings. I think it ought to be before
       November.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM1">Clifford</persName>: I think so too, I think it ought to be
       before. The problem the Russians have too, vis-á-vis Peking, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and the President meeting and all, they're
       awfully sensitive about this too. Of course, they'll get a hell of a lot of blast
       right now. Apparently, the President wants to start, however. Does he? Does he want to
       start?</p>
                        <pb n="675" xml:id="pg_675" facs="0703"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM1">Clifford</persName>: Then, what is this alternative? What would
       the Foreign Ministers meet about. Just meet together to plan an agenda for the two?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Well, to deal with that, we would try to agree on
       some general principles. [The President re-entered the room.] And then we would make a
       proposal that we're working on now. We'll have it up to the President
       shortly after August 7th we hope.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM1">Clifford</persName>: Just to finish this other point, if the
       President were to designate Bill Foster to be the chief negotiator, then I think that he
       would be waited upon by <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> and the rest of the
       Joint Chiefs and I think they'd say we can't go along, and
       there's no use taking on that kind of fight at the beginning I think. I believe
       they'd feel better about Butch Fisher than they feel about Bill Foster. I think
       they feel that Butch is a little harder nosed than Bill is. At the same time if you were to
       suggest that Butch Fisher was to be the chief negotiator I think that they'd be
       over here within the hour saying let us tell you why this must not be. <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> felt so strongly about it he called and made an
       appointment with me. He came and talked to me about it. Told about all the experiences
       they've had with <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> and it's one of
       those situations in which men get locked into a state of mind after a certain number of
       years. Now, whether there's justification for it or not, I think it's
       beside the question. If it's a state of mind, it's one that we
       don't have to take on.<note n="5" xml:id="d282fn5">In a July 30 letter responding

                        <p>In a relaxed and extensive informal talk with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on the evening of Thursday, August 15th the following points
       emerged:</p>
                        <p>1. I pointed out that the alternatives which we had suggested as to the level at which
       offensive-defensive missile talks might begin were for the purpose of making a prompt reply
       by the Soviet Union somewhat easier if our original suggestion had caused complications. The
       alternatives were given in a rough order of priority as far as our own choices were
       concerned. The Ambassador said that he might have a reply on the 16th or 17th because the
       Soviet leadership has its meeting usually on Thursdays—similar to our Tuesday
       luncheons at the White House. I told him that I thought there would be advantage in our being
       able to announce the time and place of such talks before the convening of the Non-Nuclear
       Weapons Conference later this month in Geneva.</p>
                        <p>2. On the substance of the offensive-defensive missile talks, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> reflected great earnestness in the importance of the talks and the
       seriousness with which he considered the subject. I told him that I thought that these talks
       might well be the most important talks between our two countries since World War
       II—and he agreed. He asked about our Poseidon and Minute Man Tests and I told him
       that it was not possible for us to proceed on the basis that we already had an agreement
       prior to reaching one. I said that these tests have been laid on for a long, long time and
       that the timing was not connected in any way with the timing of discussions. He seemed quite
       relaxed on this point.</p>
                        <p>3. On a very much off-the-record basis, he told me that he did not think Le Duc Tho <note n="2" xml:id="d283fn2">North Vietnam's chief negotiator at the Paris peace
        talks.</note> was bringing any change of position back to Paris with him. I clearly had the
       impression that he had had a telegram from Moscow following the Le Duc Tho visit to Moscow. I
       have passed this information on to <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> and Vance. </p>
                        <pb n="677" xml:id="pg_677" facs="0705"/>
                        <p>4. On Czechoslovakia, he said that “the” issue was the exclusive
       position of the Communist Party and the discussion in Czechoslovakia about sharing political
       responsibility with “twenty or more” parties. He said this was a matter
       of such fundamental importance that it was not only Czechoslovakia's
       business—it was also the business of the Soviet Union. He further stated that if
       the Communist Party remains in full control, the Soviets would have no problem about
       considerable changes in the internal structure of the country, especially in matters of
       economic reform.</p>
                        <p>5. He was upset by two recent instances of bad manners—partly because Moscow
       seemed to wonder whether he, the Ambassador, had handled his own part of them properly. The
       first was Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName>. Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> called him on a Monday afternoon saying that he was
       leaving for Moscow the next morning, would be in Moscow for twenty-four hours and wanted to
       see <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. The Ambassador explained to <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> that such appointments are not easy to arrange on such short notice
       but that he, the Ambassador, would do what he could. During his day in Moscow, Senator
        <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> was informed by the Soviets that Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> would see him the following morning. Much to
       their surprise, Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> simply took off for
       Prague.</p>
                        <p>The second case involved Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>. After Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s public announcement that he was
       not going to the Soviet Union, an aide of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
       telephoned <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and asked him whether there was
       any reply with regard to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit
       to Moscow. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said “What do you mean
       reply? My Government and I assume from your public statement that you are not going to Moscow
       and, therefore, there is nothing to answer.” Thereupon Nixon's aide
       said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> did wish to go to Moscow.</p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador to get a private word to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that I personally regretted bad manners but these are people whom we
       cannot control.</p>
                        <p>6. I reminded the Ambassador that he had telephoned me last week expressing concern about
       the <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> countries entering a
       “reservation” at the time of signing the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. I told him that my information was that these countries did not intend to
       enter a reservation but were stating that the timing of the ratification of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> on their part would be related to an agreement between <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> on
       safeguards.</p>
                        <p>7. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> will be coming to the United Nations
       General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>8. I referred to a remark by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> to one of
       our Embassy officers in Moscow indicating the Soviet desire to discuss the opening of
       Consulates in Leningrad and San Francisco. I told him that, in connection with the
       ratification of the Consular Agreement, I had made a <pb n="678" xml:id="pg_678" facs="0706"/>commitment to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to discuss with the Committee the
       actual opening of Consulates and I would do this in September when the Senate returns. He
       seemed to understand and was relaxed about it.</p>
                        <p>9. I asked him what they really had in mind about their proposals for a new International
       Communications Satellite System. I expressed the hope that we could find a basis for a
       genuinely international system but that we were opposed to the notion of a one nation-one
       vote formula because it separated too much actual responsibility and usage from the element
       of control. After discussing the problems created in the General Assembly by the
       multiplication of small states, he expressed the hope that we could work out some formula in
       which a general communications satellite system could come into being.</p>
                        <p>10. There was a little discussion of domestic politics in the United States but nothing of
       moment came up. I declined to answer his question as to whether or not there was a
       “New <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>.”</p>

                        <p>You will recall that you earlier wrote me about the desirability of reaching an

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion:</p>
                        <p>The Soviets proposed formally to us on August 13 that we begin negotiations as soon as
       possible with the aim of opening a Soviet Consulate General in San Francisco in exchange for
       an American Consulate General in Leningrad. This proposal followed informal approaches to <pb n="680" xml:id="pg_680" facs="0708"/>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> by various Soviet officials, including Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I suggest that we respond favorably to the Soviet proposal. A Consulate General in
       Leningrad would provide us with a valuable listening post in one of the most important urban
       political and cultural centers in the Soviet Union. It would also enable us to maintain
       better contact with American students at Leningrad University, to be of greater service to
       United States citizens traveling in northern Russia, and to handle more effectively other
       consular matters such as shipping, estate cases, citizenship and visa issuance. Finally, it
       would be a positive and useful step forward in support of your policy of promoting closer
       ties and understanding between our two countries.</p>
                        <p>We estimate the cost of establishing a post in Leningrad at approximately $250,000 for the
       first year, with an annual cost thereafter of roughly $159,000.</p>
                        <p>We see no insurmountable problem with the Soviet wish to have a Consulate General in San
       Francisco. Mayor Joseph Alioto has already requested our assistance in encouraging the
       Soviets to choose his city. Thus, local cooperation appears assured.<note n="3" xml:id="d285fn3">Gov. Reagan could present a problem. [Handwritten footnote by <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> in the source text.]</note>

                        <p>During the ratification debate on the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Consular Convention on July 30, 1965, I
       promised to consult with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee before we considered opening
       negotiations with the Soviets on establishing any consular posts. (We will, of course, also
       consult the leadership and members of the California Congressional Delegation.) Before
       proceeding to ascertain the Committee's views on this matter, I would like to
       obtain your concurrence.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss> 82080. This afternoon <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> handed to Sec. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> a
       hand-written note (which I shall preserve) as follows:</p>
                        <p>“There is positive attitude in Moscow to the wish of President Johnson to meet
       within the Soviet Union with the Soviet leaders for exchange of opinions on the questions of
       mutual interest.</p>
                        <p>There is no doubt that for the leaders of the two greatest states of the world there is
       what to exchange opinions about—in the field of relations directly between our two
       countries as well as in the field of pending big international problems. And there has piled
       up quite a few of such problems, as is known.</p>
                        <p>So far as the question of the time of the visit of President Johnson to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is concerned, we suggest that this visit takes place in the
       first decade (ten days) of October.</p>
                        <p>As the Secretary of State will recall, in our talk on July 1,<note n="2" xml:id="d286fn2">See <ref target="#d278">Document 278</ref>.</note> he said about a possibility of an
       unofficial visit of President Johnson to Leningrad to meet there with the Soviet leaders.</p>
                        <p>It is acceptable to us. There is no objections in Moscow—if the American side
       desires it—to an announcement in the nearest time about the coming visit of
       President Johnson to the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>We can suggest in this case the following text of an announcement for the press:</p>
                        <p>“Concerning the coming visit of the President of the USA L. Johnson to the
       Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>An agreement has been reached that the President of the United States <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName> will visit the Soviet Union in the first
       decade [<hi rend="italic">week</hi>] of October 1968 for the exchange of opinions with the
       leading figures of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on the questions of mutual
       interest.”</p>
                        <p>If you wish to see Sec. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> this evening, he is
       available and standing by. I will only refer to this message but not discuss its contents if
       I can get you on the ground in Detroit.<note n="3" xml:id="d286fn3">The President departed

                        <p>Dear Mr. President,</p>
                        <p>My colleagues and I have acquainted ourselves with your letter of July 30 of this year<note n="2" xml:id="d287fn2">See <ref target="#d282fn5">footnote 5, Document 282</ref>.</note> on
       the question of Soviet-American negotiations concerning the integral limitation and then
       reduction of both the delivery systems of offensive strategic nuclear weapons and of the
       defense systems against ballistic missiles.</p>
                        <p>We note with satisfaction your agreement with the proposed period and place of these
       negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the level for conducting the negotiations on this question, we are inclined
       toward the appointment of special delegations for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>As far as the specific date for beginning the negotiations at Geneva, we thought it
       possible to propose September 30, that is, to begin the negotiations immediately after the
       end of the conference of non-nuclear states which, as is known, will take place in Geneva
       from August 29 to September 28 of this year. We also consider it possible to announce the
       proposed date for beginning the Soviet-American negotiations even prior to the opening of the
       conference of non-nuclear states, for example, on August 22. The text of the announcement
       could be the following:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">“Concerning the Soviet-American Negotiations on the
       Question of Curbing the Strategic Armaments Race</p>

       limitation and reduction of both the delivery systems of offensive strategic nuclear weapons
       and the defense systems against ballistic missiles. The Parties have agreed to appoint
       special delegations for this purpose.”</p>

                        <p>Herewith some notes for your and my backgrounders tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>1. The agreement announced this morning that the President will confer with leaders within
       the Soviet Union in early October is the outcome of a long process.</p>
                        <p>—it began in early 1964 when President Johnson first addressed himself to Moscow
       on a range of major substantive issues;</p>
                        <p>—it is a natural follow-on from the two intensive meetings at Glassboro in June
       of last year;</p>
                        <p>—it is also natural that the Chiefs of Government of the two countries should
       meet in the light of the intense negotiating efforts undertaken over the 14 months since the
       Glassboro meetings.</p>
                        <p>2. President Johnson's first major substantive message to the Soviet leaders was
       in mid-January 1964.<note n="4" xml:id="d288fn4">See <ref target="#d1">Document
        1</ref>.</note> It proposed, among other things, that the two nations address themselves to
       the following objectives which would move the world towards peace:</p>
                        <pb n="684" xml:id="pg_684" facs="0712"/>
                        <p>—to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons;</p>
                        <p>—to end the production of fissionable material for weapons;</p>
                        <p>—to transfer large amounts of fissionable materials to peaceful purposes;</p>
                        <p>—to ban all nuclear weapons tests;</p>
                        <p>—to place limitations on nuclear weapons systems;</p>
                        <p>—to reduce the risk of war by accident or design;</p>
                        <p>—to move toward general disarmament.</p>
                        <p>In general, President Johnson urged that the two nations work on “specific
       problems”—such as these—rather than on “vague
       declarations of principle” that might be agreed. That has been the
       President's approach to U.S.-Soviet relations since then.</p>
                        <p>3. Progress was slow, but in the autumn of 1966, as a result of discussions between Foreign
       Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, the outlines of a feasible Non-Proliferation Treaty began
       to fall into place and work intensified in that field. In November, 1966, the U.S.-Soviet
       Civil Air Agreement was signed. In late January, 1967, the U.S. initiated with the Soviet
       Union exchanges on the possibility of limiting both offensive and defensive strategic
       weapons; and, on the basis of a letter from <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> of
       late February, the President announced on March 2 the willingness of the Soviet Government to
       discuss this subject.<note n="5" xml:id="d288fn5">See <ref target="#d193">Document
        193</ref>.</note> During the Middle East war of June, 1967, the Soviets initiated the use of
       the hot line; and a cease-fire was achieved in New York on the basis of intensive exchanges
       over that line (and otherwise) between the two governments.</p>
                        <p>4. Against this background it was natural that Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and President Johnson should find an occasion to meet when <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> came to the United Nations meetings in New York on the
       Middle East late in June. At Glassboro the two leaders took the occasion for two days of
       exchanges covering a very wide range of topics, notably:</p>
                        <p>—the Middle East;</p>
                        <p>—Vietnam;</p>
                        <p>—the Non-Proliferation Treaty; and</p>
                        <p>—the possibility of a U.S.-Soviet agreement on the limitation and subsequent
       reduction of offensive and defensive nuclear arms.</p>
                        <p>The President sought at that time a firm date and place for the opening of strategic arms
       talks; but the Soviet Government was not yet prepared for a decision.</p>
                        <p>5. Since Glassboro, U.S.-Soviet cooperation has helped yield some striking results-great
       and small:</p>
                        <p>—The Non-Proliferation Treaty has moved forward and been signed by 77
       nations;</p>
                        <pb n="685" xml:id="pg_685" facs="0713"/>
                        <p>—At the July 1, 1968, signing of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the two nations
       agreed to hold talks on strategic arms limitation in the near future. We expect a time and
       place to be set before too long.</p>
                        <p>—Between September, 1967, and April, 1968, a treaty on the return of astronauts
       was negotiated and signed;<note n="6" xml:id="d288fn6">For text of the Agreement on the

                        </p>
                        <p>—In November, 1967, the U.S. and the Soviet Union joined in support of a
       Security Council resolution on the Middle East which is the basis of Ambassador
       Jarring's mission;</p>
                        <p>—In July, 1968, the first flights took place under the U.S.-Soviet bilateral Air
       Agreement;</p>
                        <p>—In June, 1968, the Consular Convention was ratified and went into effect in
       July;</p>
                        <p>—In July, 1968, bilateral U.S.-Soviet discussions were inaugurated on the Law of
       the Sea;</p>
                        <p>—In addition, progress was made in such other bilateral matters as the Cultural
       Exchange Agreement, Renewal of Atomic Energy Exchange Agreement, and the negotiation to
       improve Embassy sites.</p>
                        <p>In short, the year since Glassboro has been, certainly, the most intensive and successful
       post-war year in U.S.-Soviet relations despite failure to achieve full and effective
       agreement on two great unresolved issues:</p>
                        <p>—the Middle East; and</p>
                        <p>—Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>President Johnson has steadily emphasized both the reality of the progress achieved and the
       reality of the dangerous unresolved issues that remain between the two nations.</p>
                        <p>6. On March 31, when President Johnson withdrew from the presidential nomination, he had
       very much in mind a desire to devote himself as fully as possible to movement towards peace.
       He, therefore, was pleased when, after preliminary exploration by both sides, it was agreed
       that a meeting this autumn of the Chiefs of Government of the Soviet Union and the United
       States made sense. Before Glassboro, at Glassboro, and since Glassboro he has worked to make
       the strategic missile talks a reality. The question of time and place was dealt with in a
       number of exchanges at the highest level, notably since the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> moved towards reality in June. If any one factor crystallized the decision in
       both governments to move to a summit meeting it was probably the agreement to proceed to
       strategic missile talks. We felt it might be helpful if the Chiefs of Government could meet
       in roughly the same <pb n="686" xml:id="pg_686" facs="0714"/>period as these talks were
       inaugurated, because of the importance, the sensitivity, and the complexity of negotiations
       on this matter—which President Johnson has often emphasized. We have no
       announcement to make at the present time; but, as indicated earlier, we expect to be in a
       position to make an announcement soon on the time, place, and level of the strategic missile
       talks.</p>
                        <p>7. Although the opening of the strategic missile talks was probably the catalyst that led
       to this decision by the two Governments, the meeting of President Johnson with Chairman
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> will undoubtedly be the occasion to consult
       on:</p>
                        <p>—a variety of bilateral matters;</p>
                        <p>—next steps in the implementation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty;</p>
                        <p>—the possibilities of bringing our positions closer on the Middle East and on
       Vietnam.</p>

                        <p>On the night of August 20–21, 1968, Soviet and other Warsaw Pact troops invaded
       Czechoslovakia. Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> informed
       President Johnson of the invasion at a White House meeting that began at 8:15 p.m. on August
       20. A summary of the meeting and the text of the Soviet message read by <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> at the meeting are printed in <ref target="frus1964-68v17#d80">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1964–1968, Volume XVII, Document 80</ref>. At
       10:15 p.m. on August 20 the President convened an emergency meeting of the National Security
       Council, at which a decision was made to inform <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that the U.S. Government would not announce the President's
       impending visit to Moscow. For notes of the meeting, see ibid., <ref target="#d81">Document

                        <p>President Johnson condemned the invasion of Czechoslovakia in a statement broadcast by

       of State in telegram 9465 that all elements of the mission had been asked “to keep
       official and social contacts with Soviet authorities to minimum,” an action
       approved by the Department in telegram 224834, August 21. Plans for technical talks with the

                        <p>“The Secretary said he had asked the Ambassador to come in for a very informal
       chat about current problems. He began by referring to his talk with the Ambassador early in
       the week on developments in Czechoslovakia.<note n="2" xml:id="d290fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had brief meetings with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on Monday morning, August 19, and at 11:35 p.m. on
        August 20. (Ibid., <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> Appointment Book) A report on
        the latter meeting is printed in <ref target="frus1964-68v17#d82">

       The Secretary said that he came from Georgia and was sometimes referred to as soft spoken in
       manner. He wondered whether the Ambassador had in any way been misled by the manner in which
       he had discussed the Czechoslovakia problem, and whether the Ambassador had fully understood
       the significance of what the Secretary had told him about reaction in this country and the
       possible effect of Czechoslovakia developments on Soviet-American relations.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he had fully understood the Secretary's remarks. He said
       that the decision which his government had made was obviously not an easy one. The reaction
       in the United States and for that matter in certain Communist Parties had been clearly
       predictable. He had personally thought that a solution to the Czech problem had been found,
       but something must have happened to change the situation. In speculating on what this might
       be the Secretary referred to Herr Ulbricht's visit to Czechoslovakia. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that Soviet policy was not determined by Herr
       Ulbricht or anyone else. East Germany was of course an important member of the Warsaw Pact,
       but the Soviets knew how to say no to Herr Ulbricht. Later in the conversation Ambassador <pb n="688" xml:id="pg_688" facs="0716"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>
       speculated on the role of the Czechoslovakia press in effecting the Soviet reaction, and
       Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> acknowledged that this was
       certainly a factor. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that his
       counselor had returned from Moscow last weekend, and had told him that most of the Soviet
       leaders were on vacation. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had been on the
       verge of asking permission to accompany his wife and daughter when they return to the Soviet
       Union next Tuesday. He indicated he had received word of the change in Soviet policy only a
       short time before he had informed the President about it.</p>
                        <p>When the Secretary indicated that he had been surprised by the Soviet action, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> attempted to justify it largely on the basis of
       internal developments in Czechoslovakia. The Secretary said that we had seen no indications
       that Czechoslovakia intended to leave the Warsaw Pact or conduct itself in any way other than
       as a member of the socialist camp. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that
       in his view it had become clear that <persName corresp="#p_DA1">Dubcek</persName>
                            <note n="3" xml:id="d290fn3"> Alexander Dubcek, First Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist
        Party.</note> was a weak leader who was allowing things to drift, and that in these
       circumstances the right was steadily gaining influence, and the Soviets thought that
        <persName corresp="#p_DA1">Dubcek</persName> was losing control of the situation. These
       developments were leading in the direction of a situation in which Czechoslovakia would no
       longer be a member of the Warsaw Pact. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
       emphasized that the Czech economic reforms had nothing to do with the case as the Soviets
       considered that this was a matter for them alone to decide.</p>
                        <p>When the Secretary again referred to the possible effects of recent developments on
       Soviet-American relations, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he could
       tell the Secretary that he had received instructions to say, in case the subject were raised,
       that the Soviet Union desired to continue to make progress upon the bilateral questions with
       which they had been dealing before the recent Czech events. He referred specifically to the
       peaceful uses of atomic energy and the strategic missile problem. He understood that it would
       probably be impossible for the United States to proceed immediately in these matters while
       the international situation was still so unclear. Without wishing to press the Secretary he
       wondered whether as a matter of policy, unrelated to timing, the United States would also
       wish to proceed to deal with these problems.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that his reply would have to consist of two statements. The first was
       that from the beginning of his administration the President was profoundly and passionately
       interested in advancing the cause of peace and in promoting better relations and better
       understanding between our two countries. We of course had differences, and some of these
       would remain but in this atomic age the President considered <pb n="689" xml:id="pg_689" facs="0717"/>it essential to do everything he could to diminish dangers of conflict. The
       Secretary mentioned that the President had today met with the Congressional leadership. Many
       of these men had been scattered about the country, and their reactions reflected the serious
       impression which the Czech developments had had on the American people. It appeared that the
       President would be subject to strong criticism for his efforts in building better relations
       with the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, he could assure the Ambassador of the
       President's deep commitment to the cause of peace.</p>
                        <p>The second part of his answer was that at the present stage he simply could not say what
       the policy of the United States would be upon the problems under discussion with the Soviet
       Union.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed the hope that President Svoboda's<note n="4" xml:id="d290fn4"> Ludvik Svoboda, President of Czechoslovakia.</note> visit to Moscow would
       be successful. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that Svoboda would stay
       on until the next day when he would return to Czechoslovakia. The Secretary raised the
       question of the safety of the Czech leaders, and <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that while of course he had no specific information, he was
       convinced that no harm would come to <persName corresp="#p_DA1">Dubcek</persName> or the
       other Czech personalities. In this connection the Secretary referred to the Czech radio
       broadcast commenting on the composition of the Czech delegation that had gone to Moscow.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary mentioned that the President had gone to the ranch. We had received in the
       last few hours a number of alarming rumors about a possible Soviet invasion of Romania. The
       Secretary emphasized that these rumors had not come to us from the Romanians. The Ambassador
       would surely be aware of what the effect such action would have upon the United States
       opinion coming on top of the recent Soviet action in Czechoslovakia. The Secretary expected
       the President to telephone him as soon as he arrived at the ranch and received these reports,
       and the Secretary did not know what he should reply. He asked whether <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had any information on this subject. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he had neither seen nor heard any indication
       whatever of any contemplated Soviet action against Romania, and did not believe that there
       was anything to these rumors. On the contrary, he referred to the warm greetings which the
       Soviet leadership had sent to the Romanian leaders on the occasion of their national
        holiday.<note n="5" xml:id="d290fn5">On August 30 <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
        again raised with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> the issue of a possible

                        <p>The Secretary concluded the conversation by stating that he did not contemplate informing
       the press of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s

       of his conversation yesterday with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d291fn2">A memorandum of their conversation on

                        </p>
                        <p>In the course of my talk with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, he raised
       the question of the possible visit of the President to Leningrad and the missile talks. He
       said it appeared clear that his government had decided to separate the two matters. He
       personally had the impression that the President was interested in visiting the Soviet Union
       and that this had been a maximum desire whereas a meeting of the chiefs of government in
       Geneva in connection with the missile talks would have been the President's
       minimum desire.</p>
                        <p>I said I was not here at the time and did not know the President's mind on these
       matters.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he thought the Soviet Government had
       agreed to Geneva as a locale for the talks as a response to our wishes. He thought that if we
       preferred to have them in Moscow, there would be no problem on their part.</p>
                        <p>I said I had no idea what our views on the matter were. I said that obviously both these
       matters would be contingent on what now happened in Czechoslovakia.</p>
                        <p>I said I was personally optimistic that missile talks could succeed as I was convinced that
       it was in the interest of both our countries.</p>
                        <p>He said that when he was last in Moscow he had seen draft instructions which were of such
       nature that he would have been quite satisfied to have headed the talks on the Soviet side on
       the basis of these instructions. He said they were long and complex but quite serious. He
       also said that the Soviets envisaged that the talks would be held in secret.</p>
                        <p>I replied that I assumed that this would also be our view although we would undoubtedly
       have to let our allies know the general trend of the talks which increased the possibility of
       leaks.</p>
                        <p>He said he quite understood the present situation and observed that we had a month before
       the missile talks were scheduled to begin.</p>
                        <pb n="691" xml:id="pg_691" facs="0719"/>
                        <p>I asked who he thought would head up the missile talks on the Soviet side if they were on
       the level of special delegations. He said he did not know but when I suggested it might be
       someone like <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName>, he said he thought this was a
       real possibility.</p>
                        <p>He said that he understood that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> intended to
       come to New York about the first of October for the General Assembly. He asked me to let him
       know anything I could before my departure on our attitude with respect to the missile
       talks.</p>
                        <p>In the course of the conversation, I made quite clear that a number of problems in our
       bilateral relations would depend upon how matters actually developed in Czechoslovakia and
       that in any event some immediate issues would be adversely affected. He indicated that he
       fully understood this.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> noted that the West Germans, the Chinese
       Communists and the Secretary had raised the question of Romania and he wondered why. He
       smiled when he mentioned the Chinese. I replied that from our point of view it was quite
       simple. The day the Secretary spoke to him, we had received a series of alarming reports from
       non-Romanian sources and it was quite natural for the Secretary to ask about them.</p>

         <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> met with the President and Rostow from
        1–1:47 p.m. on September 5. The President's Daily Diary records the following
        about the meeting: “Amb returns to Moscow next Monday or Tuesday …
        hopes to get guidance on how to respond when—as he expects—Soviet
        leaders ask him whether we are prepared to go forward on pending initiatives.”

                        <p>The President wishes to hold open the possibility of strategic weapons talks. His present
       idea is that he would open these talks at the highest level, not via the Secretary of Defense
       or the Director, <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> should try to get any indication if there is any “give on
       this subject” or any truly serious “interest.” The President
       does not wish to do anything unless there is “some chance—a modicum of
       hope—of agreement.”</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> should begin, however, by executing the
       instruction the President gave him with respect to his meeting on Friday<note n="2" xml:id="d292fn2">September 6.</note> with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> at
       lunch; that is, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> should be made clearly to
       understand that the President resents the Soviet circulation of the idea that he is
       personally anxious for some contact at the highest level with the Soviet Union. This has been
       damaging. The President is not interested in personal contacts or cosmetics. He is only
       interested in a meeting where there is a serious possibility that major, substantive results
       could be achieved.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador asked if I could give him any information on a number of matters that were
       up for decision. He mentioned the Non-proliferation Treaty, the exchange of ratifications of
       the Agreement on the Return of Astronauts, and the talks on strategic missiles.</p>
                        <p>On the Non-proliferation Treaty, I said that I thought the President and the Secretary
       considered this a multilateral agreement which should not be related to other issues. On the
       other hand, he must be aware of the sentiment that was building up in the Congress as the
       result <pb n="693" xml:id="pg_693" facs="0721"/>of developments in Czechoslovakia and that we
       would have to investigate further to see what the line would be in the Senate. The Ambassador
       indicated that he quite understood that it might be wise not to bring this matter to a head
       in the immediate future.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the Agreement on the Return of Astronauts, I said that it was my
       understanding that we had not yet ratified this agreement. He said this was contrary to his
       information although he could well be wrong and asked if someone in the Department would let
       him know the status of the matter.</p>
                        <p>On the strategic missile talks, I said that I could not give him any definite information
       as the matter was still under active consideration. I referred to recent speeches in Congress
       which reflected the very strong sentiment that was extremely critical of the Soviet action in
       Czechoslovakia. I mentioned specifically statements by Senators Hruska and <persName corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName> as well as others. The Ambassador indicated that he was
       familiar with these statements and mentioned in fact that there were a number of others.</p>
                        <p>I said that in this connection I wished to tell him that the President had been very much
       concerned at statements in the American press to the effect that the President was very eager
       for a meeting with the Soviet leaders. I said I thought the President had the impression that
       at least some of these pieces had been inspired by Soviet sources.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> reacted immediately and vigorously. He said
       he could assure me that his Embassy was in no way responsible. In order to draw him out
       further, I mentioned a piece by Joseph Kraft who was known to have good contacts with his
       Embassy. He said that his Counselor had talked to Kraft who had reported to him that Kraft
       had queried him about a possible Presidential visit and that his Counselor had confined
       himself saying that was up to the American side. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he could assure me that he had no instructions to raise this
       matter other than reply to questions, and the Soviet position was in fact that this was up to
       the American side. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that we obviously had
       ways of running down these matters and that he was confident that his Embassy was not
       involved since he had given strict instructions on this matter. He said he had himself noted
       these press references and realized that they were most unhelpful. He said he could not help
       but suspect that someone was interested in preventing any top level meeting, and he wondered
       if the West Germans or others were not responsible.</p>
                        <p>Continuing on the strategic missile talks, I said that I could not improve upon the
       presentation made to him by the Secretary who had explained the President's
       long-standing and deep interest in promoting the cause of peace and better understanding
       between our two countries. On the other hand he could understand that in the light of the <pb n="694" xml:id="pg_694" facs="0722"/>Czech developments and the reaction in this country,
       the President was in a very difficult position. I thought that if the President could be
       reasonably certain that real progress could be made, he would be prepared to disregard
       criticism of him for a meeting but it was of course difficult to know in advance what the
       prospects of success were.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the missile talks, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied
       that he had seen on his last visit to Moscow the draft instructions to the Soviet delegation.
       They were very detailed and raised a number of complex issues. On the other hand, they were
       devoid of polemics and represented a serious effort to find a basis for agreement. He
       suggested that the talks need not necessarily be opened on a top level and thought that in
       any event the issues were of such a nature that they could not entirely be resolved in one
       brief discussion.</p>
                        <p>I concluded by repeating that no decision had been made. He emphasized that he had not been
       instructed to press us on the matter and I got the impression that the Soviets would
       understand if a date later than September 30 was suggested.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>You should know that, pursuant to your instructions, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> is dropping by my home at 8:30 p.m. this evening.</p>
                        <p>I attach notes on your guidance to me over the phone. I would, of course, make these points
       in appropriately diplomatic—but quite clear—form—but blunter
       than if I were at State.</p>
                        <p>The technical problem is this:</p>
                        <p>—On strategic missiles, neither we nor Moscow can assess whether the first talks
       could be productive until each side had quietly examined the other's opening
       position. Otherwise the meeting could only be productive in the sense that initial views were
       exchanged and both sides agreed to meet again.</p>
                        <pb n="695" xml:id="pg_695" facs="0723"/>
                        <p>—On other matters, the great thing would be for the meeting to announce forward
       movement on Vietnam and the Middle East. That depends, of course, on what emerges in Paris
       and in New York (General Assembly) in the weeks ahead.</p>
                        <p>I shall communicate the message precisely as given to me; but the optimum outcome would be
       for <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> to come back and say we're
       prepared to work towards a meeting with positive results and see, in, say, three weeks time,
       whether a basis existed for a positive, constructive result.</p>
                        <p> Walt </p>
                        <p>

                        <p>Washington, September 7, 1968.</p>
                        <p>1. The President does not wish to launch the missile talks at a meeting lower than the
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>-Johnson level.</p>
                        <p>2. The President is prepared to contemplate a meeting in the original time
       frame—that is, October 1—10—if there could be good
       results.</p>
                        <p>3. Frankly, a meeting which was not successful would simply give a political handle to
        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> that President Johnson “was selling
       the country out.”</p>
                        <p>4. Only if <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> believes the chances for a
       productive meeting “are good” is the President prepared to contemplate
       such a session.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> should be aware of the depth of the
       Congressional reaction about Czechoslovakia. (See Hruska and <persName corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName> speeches.)</p>
                        <p>6. If the Soviet Union does not want to deal with President Johnson on these matters
       constructively, they can wait for <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>. (See latest
        polls.)<note n="3" xml:id="d294fn3">In a September 6 memorandum to the President on the

        with <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> at lunch on September 10. He also indicated
        that there were only two copies, the President's and his, and there would be no
        copy in the State Department. A handwritten note on page 1of the memorandum states that
         <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> did not keep a copy.</note>

                        <p>Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>Pursuant to my memorandum to you of yesterday (attached),<note n="2" xml:id="d295fn2">
                                <ref target="#d294">Document 294</ref>.</note> Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> came to my home at 8:30 yesterday evening. We had a very long private
       conversation.</p>
                        <p>1. After amenities, I explained that I wished to talk to him about the context of the
       message given him by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> a few days
        ago<note n="3" xml:id="d295fn3">See <ref target="#d293">Document
       293</ref>.</note>—the context being, perhaps, more appropriate for a White House
       aide to explain than an Ambassador. I then presented the six points<note n="4" xml:id="d295fn4">See the attachment to <ref target="#d294">Document 294</ref>.</note> in a
       lucid and appropriate form. Before the evening was over, he took down the six points. I
       phrased the sixth about as follows: “If the Soviet Union does not wish or does not
       find it possible to deal with President Johnson on these matters constructively, this would
       be understood; but they should study carefully the political temper of the United States and
       especially recent polls.” I gave him a copy of the latest Gallup poll, as well as
       a copy of the <persName corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName> and Hruska speeches.<note n="5" xml:id="d295fn5">See <ref target="#d292fn3">footnote 3, Document 292</ref>, and <ref target="#d294fn3">footnote 3, Document 294</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is no doubt that he has those points with absolute clarity, returning to them several
       times before he left.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then turned to the problem of the
       missile talks. He said, as he had said several times to <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>, that he had seen the position papers of the Soviet Union. They were
       detailed and highly technical. Moreover, he said that as a diplomat he must report to me in
       candor that they represented not a final position but a bargaining position. He assumed that
       our papers would be similar in character. To complete the negotiation on the missile question
       would, in his judgment, take considerable time. Therefore, if concrete results were to emerge
       from a first meeting between <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and the
       President, he thought we should consider two possible steps:</p>
                        <pb n="697" xml:id="pg_697" facs="0725"/>
                        <p>—an early exchange of papers at the Ambassadorial level: via <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> in Moscow and <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> in Washington. This could be done quietly and would give each side a
       chance to see what elements in them could be the subject for an interim agreement in
       principle at the Summit meeting;</p>
                        <p>—an effort be made, before a Summit meeting, to agree on these matters of broad
       principle which would guide the negotiations in the wake of a Summit meeting.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then turned to the Middle East and
       raised this question: In the wake of their paper to us on the Middle East,<note n="6" xml:id="d295fn6">
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> gave the paper to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> during their meeting on September 4. The text is scheduled for publication
        in <ref target="frus1964-68v20">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1964–1968, volume XX</ref>.</note> is there any
       way that a Summit meeting might push us towards peace in the Middle East? I then pointed out
       to him that the paper they had given us was interesting in structure, but it did not come to
       grips with the Israeli judgment that only direct negotiations could lead to a settlement
       which would be politically and psychologically stable. I told him we were taking the Soviet
       paper seriously, but there were problems with it, including the relationship of any views
       that might be developed between the United States and the Soviet Union on the one hand, and
       the Jarring mission on the other.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then made a long reply with the
       following points:</p>
                        <p>—After the Arab-Israeli war, the Soviet Union could have exploited the situation
       to set up bases and greatly to strengthen its military and political position in the Middle
       East. They had decided not to do so. This paper reflected an authentic desire for a stable
       settlement.</p>
                        <p>—We should be conscious of one particular point in the Soviet proposal; namely,
       the idea of a Four-Power guarantee of Middle Eastern borders. The idea had come to him
       through Dr. Nahum Goldman, an old Zionist. He, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, and the Soviet Government had concluded that a Four-Power guarantee of
       the Middle Eastern frontiers was the most solid basis the Israelis could acquire for the
       continuity of their national existence-more solid than a peace treaty with the Arab states.
       He suggested that, perhaps, an agreement on this particular point might be a constructive
       item for a Summit meeting.</p>
                        <p>—As for the rest of the substance of the paper, he thought that Jarring might
       submit some such paper against the background of prior U.S.-Soviet agreement. Jarring had
       been running around the Middle East, but not making much progress. If he could put in a
       proposal backed by the U.S. and the Soviet Union, then his mission might move forward more
       rapidly.</p>
                        <pb n="698" xml:id="pg_698" facs="0726"/>
                        <p>He returned several times in the course of the conversation to a Four-Power guarantee as
       the critical element for Israel in the Soviet paper.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then turned to Vietnam and talked at
       very great length, making, in the end, the following points:</p>
                        <p>—He continued to regret that we had not responded more positively to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s statement that “he and his
       colleagues had reason to believe, etc.”<note n="7" xml:id="d295fn7">Reference is
        to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s June 6 letter to Johnson
        scheduled for publication ibid., volume VI.</note> To the best of <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s knowledge, this was a unique message to
       the United States. He had hoped that if we could not act immediately upon it we would come
       back with a proposition which “<persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and
       his colleagues” might press on Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>—He then raised the subject of the third offensive. With striking candor he
       said: “Now that the Democratic Convention is over, the offensive may
       subside.” If there was a lull in the level of violence in South Vietnam, would we
       be willing to stop the bombing? He then introduced the familiar argument that we were
       “a great country dealing with a small country” and we could afford to
       be generous. I said the question was not one of generosity, but of the lives of American
       soldiers and our allies. There is also the critical matter that if they were not prepared for
       reciprocity at this stage, I did not see how a stable peace could be negotiated for Southeast
       Asia. The negotiation of a peace would have to confront certain hard facts about the presence
       of North Vietnamese forces in Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam. If we evaded the question of
       reciprocity on the bombing, we might then be confronted with a similar stubbornness and
       unwillingness to face reality with respect to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in
       Saigon; then, the question of North Vietnamese troop withdrawals from the South; etc. We did
       not see why, if they were serious, they would not settle down and make peace on the basis of
       hard realities.</p>
                        <p>—This led to a very long series of statements on the mind of the men in
       Hanoi—and in Peking—as seen from Moscow. He began with the Chinese
       Communists. He said that in their dealings with Moscow, the Chinese Communists often took
       positions that made absolutely no sense to the Russian mind. For example, in a meeting with
       Soviet and other Communists, the Chinese Communists said bluntly they did not mind a nuclear
       war. This would wipe out most of the Soviet population and a high proportion of the Chinese
       population, but would leave them with two or three hundred million Chinese. (He reported that
       an Eastern European Communist leader spoke up and asked: “What about
       us?”) He said that while the men in Hanoi were not casual about nuclear war, they
       were filled with ideas which were foreign to Moscow <pb n="699" xml:id="pg_699" facs="0727"/>and—no doubt—to us. They took enormous pride in their capacity to
       survive and persist in conducting the war against the world's greatest power. They
       evoked memories of how they have survived for centuries against the Chinese; struggled
       successfully against the French; kept in the battle against the big American forces. They are
       very stubborn about their objectives: he cited their satisfaction and pride in forcing us to
       stop a part of the bombing. (At this point he came perilously close to suggesting that we
       should have used more power against them, but veered away quickly.)</p>
                        <p>—On the other hand, he said that Hanoi had shared with Moscow some of the
       negotiating positions they would take after a bombing cessation. He could not reveal these to
       me. But he personally concluded that they would negotiate seriously.</p>
                        <p>—In underlining the curious pride and mentality of the men in Hanoi he gave a
       long circumstantial account of how the Soviet Union was prepared to make available to them
       pilots for air defense. He said that the Soviet Union had a number of experienced pilots who
       were in retirement at an early age. Their pensions were greater than the salary of an
       Ambassador. Some Soviet military men were extremely anxious to get them into Hanoi so that
       they could acquire experience in combat with the Americans. The Americans were learning
       exactly what the capacity of their aircraft and their pilots was. The Soviet Union could only
       train their men under non-combat conditions. Therefore, the pressure to get Hanoi to accept
       Soviet pilots was considerable. But they flatly refused. He cited this, again, as an example
       of the extreme pride of a very small power in dealing with a major power.</p>
                        <p>6. I told him that I had no position to report to him on a cessation of bombing other than
       that with which he was wholly familiar. We hoped that things would move forward in Paris. If
       they wish to negotiate with President Johnson, they had better get moving. I doubted that
       they would do any better in negotiations with President Johnson's successor,
       whoever he might be. Moreover, they had better reckon that the South Vietnamese are as
       stubborn as the North Vietnamese. They will soon have a million men under arms of increasing
       competence and confidence.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then suddenly asked: If there were a
       free election in the South, how do you think it would come out? I said that it was my private
       judgment that the hard core Communists could not attract as much as 10% of the South
       Vietnamese vote. On a Popular Front basis they might do better; but, for what it was worth, I
       did not believe that a Popular Front in South Vietnam would do as well as the French and
       Italian Communist parties in their elections. He asked: How would President Thieu fare in an
       election? I took him through the election statistics (which I shall send him), pointing out
       that between them, Thieu and Huong had gotten 45% of the vote. If you added in former General
        <pb n="700" xml:id="pg_700" facs="0728"/>Don in the Senate, you were up to something like
       56% of the vote. Except for Dzu, who was in effect a Popular Front candidate, the balance
       went to anti-Communist Nationalists. I concluded that the problem of the South Vietnamese in
       an election, in my judgment, was not with a vast pro-VC majority, but how to avoid running 10
       Nationalist candidates, as they did last time. I concluded by saying that I could be wrong;
       and if the men in Hanoi believed in the popularity of their cause, let them adopt the test of
       a one-man, one-vote election. We were ready. He asked: Is Thieu ready? I said that it was my
       impression that he was ready. I cited the statement in the Honolulu Communiqué
       which he had volunteered despite the fact that he was under considerable political pressure
       at home at a time when a major attack on Saigon was expected.</p>
                        <p>8. We then concluded as follows:</p>
                        <p>—He would report the six points as the communication from me to him. He then
       went over these once more, finally, to make sure he had them clear.</p>
                        <p>—He would, on a quite different basis, put forward the idea as a matter
       discussed informally and without responsibility, of working towards a Summit in which
       intensive prior consultation had established some limited basis for a successful forward
       movement in missiles, the Middle East and, possibly, Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>—He said that, obviously, only intensive preparatory work could establish
       whether we could develop the basis for a successful Summit in the days ahead. The question
       for Moscow and for us was: Were we prepared to enter into such contingent preparatory work?
       He would put that proposition to Moscow on a personal basis. We should think about it.</p>
                        <p>9. In closing, I underlined once again the importance of how things evolved in
       Czechoslovakia and called his attention, once again, to the <persName corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName>-Hruska speeches.</p>
                        <p>10. As we walked to his car, he recalled that we had first discussed U.S.-Soviet relations
       in December 1960 in Moscow. Despite many difficult and dangerous crises and setbacks since
       then, progress had been made. It was his personal belief that we should not be excessively
       discouraged by the crisis in Czechoslovakia, but try to move forward when we could, for
       “there was no other way.”</p>

                        <p>Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>Just before 1:00 p.m. this afternoon, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> called on me to deliver orally the attached note. He left behind,
       however, his handwritten translation from which we typed up his communication,
        literally.<note n="2" xml:id="d296fn2">The typed communication is printed below; the
        handwritten translation from which it was made is attached but not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>When he had concluded, I raised the following points, after explaining that I had no other
       instruction except to receive his message and that what I was about to say was personal and
       informal.</p>
                        <p>1. Had he, in informing Moscow, made absolutely clear the distinction between my formal
       message to him and our informal discussion?<note n="3" xml:id="d296fn3">See <ref target="#d295">Document 295</ref>.</note> He said: “Absolutely.” But
       he evidently understood my major anxiety with this message, which was the phrase
       “questions named by the American side.” He knew that the Middle East
       and Vietnam had been raised in our conversation not by me but by him. He added, therefore,
       that the “two subjects of interest to the American side” had been
       “often discussed between him and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>.” I draw the conclusion, therefore, that in reporting he did not
       make it quite clear to Moscow that the notion of a Summit embracing the Middle East and
       Vietnam was, so far as our conversation was concerned, his idea and not mine, although I
       joined readily into the exchange of informal views.</p>
                        <p>2. I recalled that I had given him copies of the <persName corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName> and Hruska speeches and noted that there was, perhaps understandably, no
       reference to Czechoslovakia in this message. I asked, then, was he sure that the men in
       Moscow understood the relationship of Czechoslovakia to any possible meeting? He said:
       “Certainly, absolutely.” I then asked what his personal view was about
       Czechoslovakia in the days ahead: would things get better, or worse? He said: “I
       believe, better.”</p>
                        <p>3. He then asked me if I thought we would have an immediate response so that he should stay
       in town and not go to New York later this afternoon, remaining there Saturday.<note n="4" xml:id="d296fn4">September 14.</note> I said that if I were he, I <pb n="702" xml:id="pg_702" facs="0730"/>would proceed to New York. He said he would certainly be back
       in town on Sunday and could return to Washington if there was urgency.</p>
                        <p>4. In leaving, he asked if we could furnish him with a copy of the picture taken of him at
       the Cabinet table delivering the message on Czechoslovakia on August 20. I said that I would
       look into this somewhat ghoulish request.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Moscow, September 13, 1968.</p>
                        <p rend="center">(copy of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s handwritten paper)</p>
                        <p>1. As before the attitude in Moscow is positive to the idea of meeting with the President
       of the United States for an exchange of opinions on questions of mutual interest. The wish of
       President Johnson to have some degree of certitude in the positive outcome of his possible
       visit to the Soviet Union is understandable to us. It is also far from being indifferent to
       us what will be the result of such an exchange of opinions, though it is obvious that efforts
       from both sides will be needed to gain a success.</p>
                        <p>There is no objection in Moscow as to a discussion during such a meeting of questions named
       by the American side: curbing to strategic armaments race, question of Viet–Nam
       and the situation in the Middle East; this, of course, does not exclude the possibility of an
       exchange of opinions on other questions too.</p>
                        <p>2. So far as the question of strategic armaments is concerned, our point of view is that an
       exchange of opinions on this question during the meeting could result in an agreement that
       fulfilment of certain restraining measures in this field would answer to the interests of
       both our countries as well as to the task of strengthening international security. It would
       be possible to agree further on certain basic principles of limitation and then reduction in
       complex of both the offensive strategic nuclear weapons delivery systems and the systems of
       defense against ballistic missiles, having in mind that this would constitute a <pb n="703" xml:id="pg_703" facs="0731"/>directive of the two Governments to their delegations to engage
       then in working out of an agreement on the concrete aspects of this problem.</p>
                        <p>3. We are ready to exchange opinions on Vietnam with the understanding also of the fact
       that the Soviet Union cannot be a substitution in this question for the Government of the
       Democratic Republic of Vietnam and for the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. We
       think that such an exchange of opinions can be useful if to proceed from the fact that
       continuation of the war in Vietnam benefits nobody but those who would like to bring the
       United States and the Soviet Union into collision, and that the solution of the Vietnam
       problem can be found not on the battlefield.</p>
                        <p>We did already express to President Johnson our conviction that the current meetings in
       Paris between representatives of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and the United
       States give an opportunity to find a way out from the present situation. We continue to
       believe—and it is not without grounds—that if the United States
       completely stop bombings and other military actions against the DRV it could create a turning
       point at the meetings in Paris and would open perspectives for serious negotiations on
       political questions of a settlement.</p>
                        <p>4. On the ways of settlement of the Middle Eastern conflict the Soviet Government has not
       long ago expressed to the Government of the United States a number of concrete
       considerations. For progress in this question it is necessary, of course, that both sides
       should proceed from undesirability of a new aggravation in this region. This, in its turn,
       provides for the necessity to liquidate the consequences of last year's aggression
       of Israel against the Arab states and first of all—for the withdrawal of Israeli
       troops from the territories occupied by them, together with the end of state of belligerency
       between Israel and the Arabs, recognition of the right of each State of this region to
       existence and respect of its sovereignty, territorial integrity and political
       independence.</p>
                        <p>The striving for the political settlement of the problems of the Middle East is now, as it
       is known to us, a determining factor among the Arab leaders and we have made and are making
       all that depends on us to have this understanding strengthened in those countries of this
       region whose Governments listen to our opinion.</p>
                        <p>If the Government of the United States takes on its part the similar course in its
       relations with Israel this will greatly facilitate the stabilizing of the situation in the
       Middle East. Israel must withdraw its forces from the occupied Arab territories, then the
       threat to its existence will vanish just by itself. Then a perspective will be open of a real
       normalization of situation in all this region. If the forces of Israel were withdrawn from
       the occupied Arab territories then it would be possible to consider in the practical aspect
       also the question of curbing unnecessary <pb n="704" xml:id="pg_704" facs="0732"/>and
       wasteful arms race in the Middle East; we do remember President Johnson's interest
       in this question. We are in principle in favour of this and we believe that corresponding
       steps in such direction would not contradict the interests of the countries of this region.
       If we had such understanding between our Governments it would be then possible to find a form
       of informing the public opinion (bringing it to the public).</p>
                        <p>5. Provided there is will of both sides, steps of no small importance can be made in the
       forthcoming months in the field of Soviet–American relations and thus not a bad
       foundation can be laid for further development of these relations in future.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the idea which is being planted by some people that the agreement of the Soviet
       leaders to meet with President Johnson was allegedly guided by motivations of conjuncture [in
       his conversation with me, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> went to some
       lengths to explain the meaning in English of this Russian phrase in its political context. It
       means a short–run, expedient, perhaps insincere political motivation. Technically,
       the word, derived from the German, means fluctuating.]<note n="6" xml:id="d296fn6">Brackets
        in the source text.</note> the meaning of such allegations must be clear to the President.
       Of course they do not reflect our approach to the relations with the United States. Basic
       long–range interests of our countries and interests of peace in general are the
       determining factors in these relations. Our point of view lies in the very belief that
       current events, no matter how differently they can be perceived and interpreted, should not
       overshadow these long–ranged interests.</p>

        p.m.</date>
                        </dateline>
                        <p>Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>Herewith very tentative first thoughts on the Soviet message of today.</p>
                        <pb n="705" xml:id="pg_705" facs="0733"/>
                        <p>1. The Soviet message is basically responsive in that it suggests what a
       communiqué might look like out of a meeting between the President and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>.</p>
                        <p>—The formula on missile talks is probably as far as one could go unless one were
       immediately to exchange position papers and try to get a bit more substance into the
       communiqué.</p>
                        <p>—A good deal of work would have to be done on the Middle Eastern section because
       they have in it both the language of the November resolution and some of their old ritual
       about first withdrawal and then peace. But, presumably some hard work between Sec. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> might
       get something mutually acceptable.</p>
                        <p>—On Vietnam, the language sounds okay but they are obviously suggesting a
       bombing cessation on the basis of their word. In his conversation with me, however, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said “he had hoped that if we could not act
       immediately” upon the Soviet proposal “we would come back with a
       proposition which ‘<persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and his
       colleagues’ might press on Hanoi.” Obviously the best setting for a
       meeting in Geneva would be a bombing halt achieved on the basis of the principles you have
       laid down.</p>
                        <p>—On Czechoslovakia, I do not see how the President could go forward unless the
       Soviets had publicly agreed to a date for the withdrawal of their troops from
       Czechoslovakia.</p>
                        <p>2. I, therefore, suggest—tentatively—that you talk over this message
       quietly with Sec. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>; you consider with him whether
       he should not call in <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on Sunday and say:</p>
                        <p>—that we found the Moscow message responsive and constructive;</p>
                        <p>—that it would be enormously helpful for such a meeting if there were a bombing
       cessation at the time it took place;</p>
                        <p>—that they should urge their Hanoi friends to try intensively in Paris to
       discover, with <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName>, a version of the <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> formula or some other formula that would permit the President to call a
       bombing cessation in terms of the principles he has publicly laid down;</p>
                        <p>—that it is equally important for the total environment of the conference that
       the Czech crisis be greatly eased; and a stated</p>
                        <p>—schedule for the withdrawal of Soviet and other Warsaw Pact forces from
       Czechoslovakia, which <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> promised the President
       on August 20, would be immensely helpful.</p>
                        <p>In short, if we had a bombing cessation formula and a Soviet troop withdrawal announcement,
       we would have the proper environment for the meeting.</p>
                        <p>Sec. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> could then state that until these questions
       were answered, the President could not make a firm and definite commitment. In the meanwhile,
       he, Sec. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, was willing to work with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on the appropriate formulae for a conference
       communiquéto see if there was, in fact, the basis for significant joint statements
       on the three issues. The formula on the missile talks looked promising; there were <pb n="706" xml:id="pg_706" facs="0734"/>difficulties that would have to be ironed out with
       respect to the Middle East formula; the formula on Vietnam required that we find the
       “appropriate conditions” for a bombing cessation and that the Hanoi
       delegation in Paris go to work in the greatest seriousness and urgency on substantive issues
       immediately upon a bombing cessation, recognizing that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> must have a critical role in this settlement while, of course, the NLF could
       also participate.</p>
                        <p>3. If, in fact, we can find livable conditions for a Summit meeting in, say, Geneva, the
       President could meet thereafter with the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Chiefs of
       Government, both to report the results and to consolidate whatever measures might be agreed
       to strengthen <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>; and he could then proceed to the Far
       East to meet with the Chiefs of Government of the troop contributing nations.</p>
                        <p>4. As I say, these are first, tentative thoughts.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>Sect. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and I met at 5:30 this afternoon to
       discuss <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s message.</p>
                        <p>We talked on the basis of the attached memo to you from me (Tab A).<note n="2" xml:id="d298fn2">
                                <ref target="#d297">Document 297</ref>.</note> Sect. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> believes that he should talk with you about this tomorrow (Saturday),
       preferably in the morning, or late in the afternoon, because he has a commitment to go to the
       baseball game tomorrow afternoon with the Diplomatic Corps—his only baseball game
       of the year.</p>
                        <p>Sect. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> will speak for himself tomorrow, but he
       seemed intrigued by the Soviet message. The two key points were the proper ones; that is, a
       schedule of Soviet troop withdrawals from Czechoslovakia and a formula for a bombing
       cessation and getting on with the Paris talks. We both agreed that there was, in fact, more
       in the Soviet Middle East message than this paper suggested (the suggestion of the <pb n="707" xml:id="pg_707" facs="0735"/>belligerents signing a
       “multilateral” document of peace, and the idea of a
       Four–Power guarantee of the borders).</p>
                        <p>We talked reflectively about a possible formula for a bombing cessation. The attached cable
       from Paris (Tab B)<note n="3" xml:id="d298fn3">At Tab B is telegram 20830 from Paris,
        September 13. Etienne Manac'h was Director of Asian Affairs, French Foreign
        Ministry.</note> shows Manac'h on the same line that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> was with me and which Burchett foreshadowed the other day; namely, that
       we have a bombing cessation in return for a protracted lull. Sect. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> speculated that if the President had assurances—either in Paris
       or via the Russians—that there would be no shelling across the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, no gross violations of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, no attacks on major populated centers in South Vietnam, and an agreement that
       the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would become party to the post–bombing
       cessation negotiations, the President could say: “Against the background of the
       previous statements that I have made and on the basis of information available to me at the
       present time, I have concluded that a bombing cessation at the present time has a chance of
       advancing the cause of peace.”</p>
                        <p>In any case, Sect. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> will be turning this matter
       over in his mind and will be at your disposal tomorrow—or, if it is more
       convenient, on Sunday.</p>

                        <p>The President has considered very carefully the observations made by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on September 13.<note n="2" xml:id="d299fn2">See <ref target="#d296">Document 296</ref>.</note> He attaches serious importance to the
       understanding of Soviet leaders that a positive outcome of a highest level meeting between
       the two sides is essential to a success; and he agrees that this requires efforts from both
       sides.</p>
                        <p>The President wishes the Soviet leadership to have his further reflections about how such a
       success could be achieved.</p>
                        <p>With respect to offensive and defensive missiles, the President agrees that it ought to be
       possible to establish certain common basic principles affecting the limitation and subsequent
       reduction in such nuclear weapons systems. He further agrees that, following an accord on
       general principles at the highest level, representatives of the two sides would have to
       address themselves to the translation of general principles into the more concrete aspects of
       the problem.</p>
                        <p>It would, however, be desirable to go beyond a general statement that
       “restraining measures in this field would answer to the interests of both our
       countries as well as to the task of strengthening international security.” With
       this in mind, the President would be glad to know whether the Soviet leaders could accept the
       following general objectives as guidance for our respective delegations or would wish to
       suggest any amendments for his consideration:</p>
                        <p>—To achieve and maintain a stable U.S.–Soviet strategic deterrence by
       agreed limitations on the deployment of offensive and defensive strategic missiles.</p>
                        <p>—To enhance the credibility of our efforts to prevent the destabilizing actions
       of other nations by demonstrating U.S. and Soviet willingness to limit their strategic
       missile forces.</p>
                        <p>—To provide assurance to each of us that our security will be maintained, while
       at the same time avoiding the tensions, uncertainties, and costs of an unrestrained
       continuation of the strategic arms race.</p>
                        <p>—To improve U.S.–Soviet understanding by establishing a continuing
       process of discussion of issues arising from the strategic situation.</p>
                        <p>The President believes that it would be highly desirable for both sides to do their utmost
       to find a way to move the Vietnam problem toward a peaceful settlement. No other
       accomplishment, which might <pb n="709" xml:id="pg_709" facs="0737"/>result from a high level
       meeting, could match a good result on this problem. A significant forward step not only could
       make a major contribution to peace in Southeast Asia but it could provide the opportunity for
       general progress in reducing tensions and solving other issues in the interest of a general
       peace throughout the world.</p>
                        <p>The President is under no illusions that peace in Southeast Asia will be possible unless
       both sides desire it. For his part, he earnestly desires peace in Southeast Asia if it can be
       achieved in a way which is consistent with the vital interests of the United States and its
       allies in that part of the world. He hopes very much that the leaders in Hanoi desire a peace
       which affords the Democratic Republic of Vietnam its own security and an opportunity to
       determine its own future. In the broadest sense, it seems to us that such a peace could be
       achieved on the basis of the Geneva Accords of 1954 and 1962. Without entering into
       ideological or polemical discussion, the President thinks that any stable peace in Southeast
       Asia must give full weight to the wishes of the people concerned, a principle which is most
       often referred to as self–determination.</p>
                        <p>The talks in Paris have not, unfortunately, produced as yet any significant steps toward a
       permanent peace nor even any tangible steps toward a reduction of hostilities. We are aware,
       of course, of the insistence by Hanoi on a total cessation of the bombardment of North
       Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The President wishes the leaders of the Soviet Union to know that he is prepared to stop
       the bombing of North Vietnam. He has taken such action in the past and can do it again. But
       the leaders of the Soviet Union will surely understand that the President must be interested
       in the consequences of such an important step on his part. It is not necessary to get into
       highly theoretical or semantic discussions about such words as
       “conditions,” “reciprocity,” or
       “mutual restraint.” The President attaches no importance to modalities,
       channels of communication, or the more technical maneuvers associated with traditional
       diplomacy. He is interested in the substance and the results.</p>
                        <p>The President has noted with interest and respect the judgment of the Soviet leaders that
       they continue to believe that they have grounds for the view that a complete cessation of the
       bombardment of North Vietnam would create a turning point at the meetings in Paris and open
       possibilities for serious negotiations on political aspects of a settlement.</p>
                        <p>The leaders of the Soviet Union should know that the President is prepared to try to solve
       the matter on a de facto basis. Setting all political arguments aside, the simple fact is
       that the President could not maintain a cessation of the bombing of North Vietnam unless it
       were very promptly evident to him, to the American people, and to our allies, that such an
       action was, indeed, a step toward peace. A cessation <pb n="710" xml:id="pg_710" facs="0738"/>of bombing which would be followed by abuses of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>,
       Viet Cong and North Vietnamese attacks on cities or such populated areas as provincial
       capitals, or a refusal of the authorities in Hanoi to enter promptly into serious political
       discussions which included the elected government of the Republic of Vietnam, could simply
       not be sustained.</p>
                        <p>If, after appropriate exploration and consideration by the leaders of the Soviet Union,
       they are prepared to advise the President to proceed on the basis of what is now being said,
       the President would take their advice with the utmost seriousness.</p>
                        <p>The President believes that the leaders of the Soviet Union will understand the elementary
       requirements which any man in the President's position would face. The President
       respects the deep interest of the Soviet Union in its fellow socialist country, the
       Democratic Republic of Vietnam. He believes that the Soviet leaders, in turn, understand the
       interests and responsibilities of the United States toward the Republic of Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The President would like to emphasize his readiness to stop the bombardment of North
       Vietnam just as soon as it can be done with integrity, as a move toward peace and not as a
       unilateral concession of military advantage to those who wish to continue the battle. With
       respect to the Middle East, the President is deeply concerned about the explosive situation
       there and would like to assist in bringing about a permanent peace in that area as quickly as
       possible. He was very glad to have in front of him the views which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> gave to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>,<note n="3" xml:id="d299fn3">See <ref target="#d295fn6">footnote 6,
         Document 295</ref>.</note> which reflected, as the Ambassador indicated, the attitude of
       certain key Arab countries. We understand that the substance of these views has been made
       available to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>. We ourselves expect to
       be in touch with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> and to make a major
       effort on our side to move the matter forward. It is not the President's desire,
       at this stage, to get into the details of the views expressed by the Soviet Union. Obviously
       there are some difficulties for us in those views; for example, if the state of war in the
       area is to be eliminated at an early stage, the justification for a continued refusal or free
       passage through the Suez Canal would presumably disappear. The President was interested and
       is giving further thought to the suggestion of a possible four–power guarantee of
       a settlement which could be reached among the parties. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> will have an opportunity, during the opening stages of the United Nations
       General Assembly, to discuss these matters further in the light of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s efforts. We are inclined to believe, for a
       number of reasons, that it would be better for both sides to <pb n="711" xml:id="pg_711" facs="0739"/>give strong support to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
       than for us to try to agree details on a bilateral basis. We wish to emphasize, however, that
       we are ready at all times to exchange views with the Soviet Union on this very important part
       of the world.</p>
                        <p>The President has, as the Soviet leaders know, made a serious effort during his
       Administration to find points of agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union. He
       has done so, despite certain criticisms both at home and in some other countries, because he
       is deeply convinced that a realistic and genuine understanding between our two countries is
       of vital importance to the possibilities of a general peace. An enduring peace is the
       President's first objective. He would like nothing better than to find in the days
       and weeks ahead a good foundation which can be laid for further development of
       Soviet–American relations in the future.</p>
                        <p>The President has deeply regretted the complications created by current events which are
       differently interpreted by our two governments. He takes some encouragement from the
        message<note n="4" xml:id="d299fn4">See <ref target="frus1964-68v17#d80">

                        <p>Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> came in at 6:00 p.m. and left at 7:30
       p.m.</p>
                        <pb n="712" xml:id="pg_712" facs="0740"/>
                        <p>I handed Amb. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> the memorandum<note n="2" xml:id="d300fn2">
                                <ref target="#d299">Document 299</ref>.</note> and said it had the same status as the
       “oral communication” he delivered and left with me.</p>
                        <p>He read the communication carefully. He said in general that the communication was
       “positive and clear.” He had the following observations to make.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Missile talks</hi>. He understood our objective in proposing an
       amplification of the principles. He wanted to know, simply, whether the response of the
       Soviet government should come back through his channel to me or through normal diplomatic
       exchanges. I said that until we were clearer as to whether the conditions for a Summit were
       mutually understood and agreed, he might let their response come back to me. I then went
       through the points that it was agreed that I should make on a “personal
       basis” as reflecting the attitude of the President, as he had indicated it to Sec.
        <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and myself.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">With respect to Vietnam</hi>, he made the following points:</p>
                        <p>—As for “two days and nights” he said that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> in London had felt pressed against the wall with too
       short a time for consultation with his colleagues. Two days and two nights sounded short for
       action after the President announced a pause. I pointed out to him that the fact we were
       talking now gave the Soviet government a chance to consult within itself and with its allies.
       I was simply indicating the kind of pressures which would bear on the President. He accepted
       this without further comment. I rate his comment on London as a mere debating point.</p>
                        <p>—On the military points concerning the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and
       the cities, he said our point of view was clear. He did not know how his government would
       react. But there was no difficulty in understanding what we were saying.</p>
                        <p>—He spent a great deal of time, however, on the question of the role of the
        <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. He said that his government was absolutely confident
       that “serious negotiations” on all the issues which <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> had
       raised in Paris would follow a bombing halt. He was confident also, however, that Moscow
       could not give any assurance to us on the role of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in
       a negotiation between us and Hanoi. That was Hanoi's business and ours. He felt it
       important that, if the Soviet Union gave a positive reply to the message I had handed to him,
       that we not take such a positive reply as committing the Soviet Union to assuring the role
       which we had envisaged for the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in the negotiation. He
       felt that this was likely to be a part of the “serious negotiations”
       between ourselves and Hanoi after a bombing cessation. Since <pb n="713" xml:id="pg_713" facs="0741"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> had raised this point in Paris,
       he would expect Hanoi to be prepared to respond, after a bombing cessation. But he felt it
       important that he, personally, not deceive the President or that the Soviet Union not deceive
       the President by indirection. I responded that I was simply reporting what I understood to be
       the President's attitude. The Soviet Union had raised with us its judgment, at the
       highest level, that “serious negotiations” would follow a complete
       bombing cessation. We felt it important that they not be deceived as to what we felt was
       involved in “serious negotiations.” We had spent more than 4 months on
       the question of a bombing cessation. If bombing ceased and then had to be resumed, it would
       be a most serious matter. Therefore, while the U.S. was putting no conditions to Moscow, it
       was important that the Soviet leaders understood the President's mind in this
       matter. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> responded, closing out the
       discussion, by saying he thought that we had understood one another on a personal basis, but
       we should understand that there are limitations to which the Soviet Union could commit itself
       to the U.S. One of those limitations was the exact role of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in a Vietnamese settlement and the exact negotiating form of that settlement. I
       told him that his point of view, on a personal basis, was understood and I would report
       it.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">On the Middle East</hi>, he said that for about 6 months there were no
       communications between the U.S. and the Soviet Union on a Middle Eastern settlement. There
       was a certain amount of communication on the details of resolutions at the General Assembly,
       but nothing constructive and positive. Now the Soviet Union, on a
       government–to–government basis had laid before the U.S. a
        proposal.<note n="3" xml:id="d300fn3">See <ref target="#d295fn6">footnote 6, Document
         295</ref>.</note> If the U.S. did not wish to respond, that would be understood. It was his
       view that it would help <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> and the countries
       involved if the U.S. were to give to the Soviet Union its own ideas about how a Middle East
       settlement might be brought about. He could understand very well if the President did not
       wish to get into the details of a Middle Eastern proposal; but he underlined (3 or 4 times)
       that his Middle Eastern communication was a government–to–government
       communication. In his view, it would help <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> if
       the U.S. were to come back with its own precise views on how a Middle Eastern settlement
       could be achieved. It might clear the way for the talks between Sec. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> if this were done promptly. The two Foreign Ministers might then make
       more progress when they meet in New York and save much–needed time. I confined
       myself to saying I would report these views to the President and to Sec. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>.</p>
                        <p>4. I then went through my points on <hi rend="italic">Czechoslovakia</hi>. He asked if we
       were asking for a commitment from the Soviet Union to the U.S. <pb n="714" xml:id="pg_714" facs="0742"/>about an announcement of Soviet troop withdrawals before a Summit: if we were
       setting this as a U.S. condition? I said flatly, no. We were not talking about conditions. We
       were searching to make good on an agreed proposition; namely, that it was the interest of
       both sides to have a positive outcome of a Summit meeting. I was simply stating a fact;
       namely, that a major contribution to the success of such a Summit meeting would be that,
       pursuant to Amb. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s presentation to
       the President on August 20,<note n="4" xml:id="d300fn4">See <ref target="#d299fn4">footnote
         4, Document 299</ref>.</note> the Soviet Union would decide that it was in a position to
       “withdraw without delay” Warsaw Pact forces from Czechoslovakia.</p>
                        <p>5. In conclusion, I underlined the passage in our message in which the
       President's views on the importance of Soviet–American relations was
       expressed. What I had conveyed to him informally, in supplementing the formal message, was
       simply the underlying judgments as to what might make a meeting at the highest level a
       success. There was no question of conditions. There was no question of an ultimatum. We were
       acting on the assumption that each side was trying to establish whether, within the limit of
       its interests and responsibilities, we could produce a successful Summit meeting.</p>
                        <p>6. Amb. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> ended by repeating what he had said
       at the beginning: That our message was clear and positive. He would get in touch with me when
       he had a reply.</p>
                        <p>7. W.W.R. comment: There was nothing in the detailed conversation on a personal basis that
       was difficult except <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s anxiety
       that we not hook Moscow implicitly to a commitment that Hanoi negotiate directly with the
        <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName> government. I had the feeling—no
       more—that they expected Hanoi to more or less behave with respect to the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and the cities; but I would not hang my hat on that. With
       respect to the Middle East, he was obviously a little disappointed. I got the impression that
       Moscow expects us to come back with a concrete proposal, even if it is written in Jerusalem.
       And I, personally, do not think that would be a wholly bad idea.</p>
                        <p>P.S. I began my “informal conversation” on Vietnam by recalling the
       37–day pause and the advice from the Soviet Embassy in Washington: he immediately
       said, “That was only an Ambassador, this is the leadership of the Soviet
       Union”!!</p>

                        <p>Mr. Scheuer outlined to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Toon</persName> the status of
       Intertex's recent business dealings with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. He said he understood that, as a result of the Czechoslovak situation, our
       attitude had changed, and that we were opposed to significant new business. He wondered
       whether their competitors in Western Europe and Japan would be likely to follow the same
       policy. He also wanted to know if he would be allowed to ship some medical equipment to the
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> which he described as a routine recurring
       business.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Toon</persName> confirmed that the invasion of
       Czechoslovakia had indeed caused us to revise our thinking about trade with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. He said we no longer took the line of favoring peaceful
       trade, but were asking U.S. business to hold off from new ventures. He also noted that we
       were urging other friendly governments to follow our line. With regard to the sale of medical
       equipment, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Toon</persName> indicated that he did not think
       this would present a problem under the new policy. With regard to Mr. Scheuer's
       question as to whether the Soviets had discussed trade with us since the events last month,
       Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Toon</persName> said that they had not.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Scheuer was interested in our views as to possible legislative action on trade. We said
       that it was difficult to predict at this point what Congress might do in this regard in
       reaction to Czechoslovakia. Any East–West trade bill was, of course, out of the
       question. Mr. Yuter asked whether we intended to give <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> to
       Romania. Mr. Colbert said that we would like to have authority across the board to extend
        <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, Mr. Scheuer said they would follow our guidance on future trade transactions
       with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. He indicated some concern, however, lest
       business be lost to their competition.</p>

                        <p>Russian language broadcasts of the <gloss target="#t_BBC1">BBC</gloss>, Radio Liberation,
       Deutsche Welle and even an Ecuadorian religious station are also being jammed. The fact that
       the Soviets are using only sky wave jammers, rather than the massive coordinated sky wave and
       ground wave effort of the pre–1963 era, and are not jamming all broadcasts, e.g.,
       Baltic language broadcasts, gives some ground for hoping that the effort is limited in scope
       and related directly to Czech developments.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> has nevertheless been forced to add three new frequencies
       to its Russian–language and two new frequencies to its Ukrainian, Georgian and
       Armenian–language broadcasts. If Soviet jamming continues, <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> will need to consider inter alia reactivating its long wave transmitter in
       Munich, which operates on a wave length used by Radio Moscow—thus risking an
       escalation of the jamming effort.</p>

       International Telecommunications Convention, however, member states are required to notify
       one another of any infringements of the Convention. We would propose, therefore, to protest
       directly to the Soviets first in order to give them an opportunity to stop their jamming,
       before we protest formally to the ITU.</p>

                        <p rend="center">Summary</p>
                        <p>Moscow intervened in Czechoslovakia because it feared for its hold over Eastern Europe.
       Calculations of profit and loss with respect to Soviet international policy in general were
       secondary. The decision to invade meant that the Soviet determination to preserve the status
       quo in Eastern Europe overrode any urge that Moscow might have had to seek advantage in
       limited accommodations with the non–Communist world. In this sense, the Soviet
       leadership behaved characteristically. Intervention was, at the same time, the most difficult
       decision ever made by the <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> regime and
       may turn out to be its most fateful one.</p>
                        <p>Although the Soviets would like to regard the Czechoslovak affair as essentially internal
       business and to have the rest of the world so regard it, the issue inevitably raises
       additional issues for them: relations <pb n="718" xml:id="pg_718" facs="0746"/>between East
       and West and between Communist parties, the trend of Soviet defense spending, the development
       of the Soviet economy and internal discipline. Only time can tell whether the Soviets were
       right in concluding that intervention was the lesser of two evils. It will depend, among
       other things, on whether and for how long the pressures for reform in Czechoslovakia and
       elsewhere in the Soviet bloc can be contained; whether the collective leadership can master
       its own internal conflicts, and how the policies of others, especially the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, are influenced by what has happened in Czechoslovakia.</p>
                        <p>Increased distrust of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Soviet defensiveness and insecurity revealed by the invasion
       do not bode well for <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–Soviet relations in the
       near future. The possibility should not be excluded, however, that Moscow will see some need
       after Czechoslovakia for taking steps to keep <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–Soviet relations from settling into a total freeze. There is, at any
       rate, no present indication that Moscow's interest in missile talks with the
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is less than before.</p>

                        <p>This meeting took place at the request of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> who asked to see the Secretary on the question of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>/Soviet discussions on peaceful explosive nuclear devices (PNEDS).
       (There is a separate memorandum of conversation on this subject and on the question raised by
       the Secretary of the Soviet propaganda campaign against Germany and Berlin.)<note n="2" xml:id="d304fn2">The memorandum of conversation is printed in full in <ref target="frus1964-68v15#d290">

         285</ref>.</note> What follows is a note, in one copy, of
       off–the–record remarks made by the Secretary, and <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s responses.</p>
                        <pb n="719" xml:id="pg_719" facs="0747"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said that when he came into office he had been convinced that the Soviets
       were sincere when they said that they wanted to pursue a policy of “peaceful
       co–existence”. He had continued to hold this view during the past few
       years. There had apparently been a real desire on the part of the Soviet Union to see a
       broadening of contacts between East and West, a lessening of tensions, a degree of
       liberalization, a disposition to come to grips with some of the real problems in the world.
       However, the Soviet action in Czechoslovakia had raised questions in his mind. He
       didn't understand why the Soviets had felt it necessary to do what they did in
       Czechoslovakia. Were there new elements or forces at work in the Soviet system? Was there a
       different orientation of Soviet foreign policy in the making? What might this mean in terms
       of a policy of peaceful co–existence?</p>
                        <p>It was at this point, reported in the other memorandum, that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asserted, not on a purely personal basis but with official force, that
       the Soviet Union continued to pursue the policy of peaceful co–existence. He added
       that he had gained the impression that a number of American officials somehow thought that
       the Soviets were now deliberately attempting to intensify contacts with the United States and
       other western countries because of Czechoslovakia (i.e., presumably to help the Soviets in
       shoving Czechoslovakia under the rug). He denied that this was the case and said that these
       efforts at contact were simply the continued pursuit of peaceful co–existence, as
       before.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then referred to the fact that the invitation for a meeting between the
       President and Soviet leaders in the Soviet Union and the Czech invasion had occurred about
       the same time; that he had concluded that the Soviet decisions on both matters must have been
       made by the same people at about the same time, presumably over the weekend; and that the
       coincidence of the actions was like throwing a dead fish in the face of the President of the
       United States.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he could not give an official
       explanation of this coincidence, but being familiar with the Soviet bureaucracy, he had
       personally concluded that the decision to invite President Johnson to the Soviet Union
       (communicated to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> abroad the <hi rend="italic">Honey Fitz</hi> on the evening of August 19)<note n="3" xml:id="d304fn3">See
         <ref target="#d286">Document 286</ref>.</note> had been made in Moscow about a week before.
       He said that a decision of this kind, although having been made, nevertheless had to go
       through a bureaucratic process of several days. On the other hand, it was clear that the
       decision to invade Czechoslovakia had been made considerably later, perhaps on the weekend of
       the 17th–18th or even Monday, the 19th. He pointed to the fact that several of the
       Soviet leaders had been on vacation and were called back to Moscow over this weekend.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss> 82463. I now rate the possibilities of a positive
       response from Moscow and enough from Hanoi to proceed as one in three or one in
       four—no higher, but no lower.</p>
                        <p>On that still highly contingent basis, I thought you might wish to look at a draft
       statement announcing your decisions and your movements, to see how certain key sensitive
       matters might be dealt with:</p>
                        <p>—The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, whose stability and sense of
       confidence must be preserved;</p>
                        <p>—The Czech question;</p>
                        <p>—The <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> issue;</p>
                        <p>—The nature and limits of our understanding on the bombing cessation, so that
       your hands would not be tied should you have to resume.</p>
                        <p>At some point the Norwegians would have to step before the world and say Hanoi promised
       them no violation of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and prompt, serious, sincere
       negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Also, once the bombing stops, we have to push Moscow very hard to press for peace and to
       take a firm, unambiguous position to clear up Laos.</p>
                        <p>I have given thought to Bangkok; first or last?</p>
                        <p>The advantage of seeing the troop contributors immediately is obvious; but we will not know
       then:</p>
                        <p>—The immediate post–bombing state of the Paris talks;</p>
                        <p>—What the Russians are—and are not—prepared to do
       post–bombing, towards peace in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, I now lean to: Geneva; Brussels; Bangkok.</p>
                        <p>The advantage of Geneva first is to hold the Soviet feet to the fire on delivering in
       Paris, on Laos, etc. they have always said they could do more if we stopped bombing.
       We've got to nail it down in the first flush of the event.</p>
                        <pb n="721" xml:id="pg_721" facs="0749"/>
                        <p>I calculate something like this:</p>
                        <p>—By the end of this week we shall know whether Moscow and Hanoi will give us
       enough to proceed.</p>
                        <p>—Once you make a decision, it will take a few days to work out the scenario
       here, a few further days to get Bunker, <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName>, and
       Abrams abroad; get dates set for the Russians; inform Hanoi, if we so decide, so they can get
       out military and diplomatic instructions;</p>
                        <p>—I would guess you would want about three days in Geneva, two in Brussels,
       perhaps a stop in Paris: two days in Bangkok. With flying time, etc. perhaps eleven days. If
       talks opened in Geneva, for example, on October 7, you could be home for the weekend of
       October 19–20, I should guess.</p>
                        <p>Draft contingent text follows, which I have not showed to Sec. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> because of its highly tentative status.</p>
                        <p rend="center">DRAFT CONTINGENCY PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT</p>
                        <p>In recent weeks there have been intense private contacts, direct and indirect, with the
       authorities in Hanoi, including private meetings in Paris. There have also been a series of
       exchanges with the leaders of the Soviet Union. As a result of these exchanges, I have
       reached two conclusions.</p>
                        <p>First, I now judge that we have reason to believe the cessation of the bombardment of North
       Vietnam by U.S. forces could take place under conditions which involve no increase in the
       risk of casualties to the forces of the United States or to our allies.</p>
                        <p>I also have reason to believe that such a cessation of bombardment could lead to serious
       discussions which would move the war in Vietnam towards a settlement.</p>
                        <p>It is extremely important that the President not mislead our own people, our allies, or the
       world at large about these conclusions. We have made real progress, but I cannot guarantee at
       this stage the precise military or diplomatic behavior of the authorities in Hanoi after a
       bombing cessation. We shall have to assess that behavior with respect to military operations
       and diplomatic performance very carefully in the days ahead. But the other side knows well
       that our eyes will be focused on three specific matters:</p>
                        <p>—First, on whether the demilitarized zone is respected by their side as well as
       by our side;</p>
                        <p>—Second, whether there are attacks on the cities of South Vietnam. These could
       have the gravest consequences for the environment of diplomatic talks;</p>
                        <p>—Third, whether, in the light of the diplomatic positions we have already
       conveyed to the other side at great length, there are very <pb n="722" xml:id="pg_722" facs="0750"/>prompt, serious negotiations looking towards the earliest possible peace in
       Vietnam and Southeast Asia. There can be no political settlement in South Vietnam without the
       full participation of the Government of Vietnam. We appear to agree with the authorities in
       Hanoi that the political settlement in South Vietnam must be reached by the people of South
       Vietnam—and that means the elected constitutional Government of South Vietnam must
       play a leading role. There can be no definitive settlement of the Demilitarized Zone and
       other matters relating to the Geneva Accords of 1954 and 1962 without the full participation
       of the Government of Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The bombardment of North Vietnam will cease on ——-. We expect the new
       phase of serious, substantive discussion to open in Paris the next day,
       ——-.</p>
                        <p>Let everyone be clear: The objective of what we are doing–the test–is
       prompt and serious movement towards peace. The bloodshed in Southeast Asia must end.</p>
                        <p>The second decision at which I have arrived is that it is my duty now to meet with the
       Soviet leadership to open discussions on offensive and defensive strategic weapons and to
       discuss other matters which might advance peace in the world.</p>
                        <p>I first raised the question of limiting the arms race in strategic weapons with the Soviet
       Union in mid–January 1964. There is no single more important question before the
       Soviet Union and the United States. There is no single matter on which progress would
       contribute more to a sense of confidence and the possibility of peace throughout the world.
       In addition, success would free vast resources for productive purposes. I went into this
       question with Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> at very great length at
       Glassboro in June 1967. He agreed then, in principle, that such talks would take place; but
       there was a long delay in fixing the time and place for the opening of these talks. We have
       now agreed that the talks shall open on ——- in Geneva. I shall lead the
       American delegation, using the occasion, as I indicated, for conversations on other critical
       matters bearing on peace throughout the world. These other matters will include peace in
       Southeast Asia–where the Soviet Union bears important responsibilities as
       co–chairman of the Geneva Conferences of 1954 and 1962—and the Middle
       East, where it is my hope that in the weeks ahead all governments will contribute to the
       limit of their capacity and imagination in backing the mission of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> and achieving a breakthrough towards peace in the Middle
       East.</p>
                        <p>In making this decision, two factors have weighed heavily on my mind.</p>
                        <p>The first was the future of the people of Czechoslovakia. As I have said before, the
       entrance of Warsaw Pact forces into Czechoslovakia <pb n="723" xml:id="pg_723" facs="0751"/>was a tragic event and a setback to men's hopes everywhere for peace,
       moderation, and the gradual easing of tensions in Central Europe. It was a dangerous event
       because it brought into Central Europe substantial additional Soviet forces threatening to
       upset the military equilibrium. Events of recent days have somewhat eased, but not ended the
       tensions and danger in Central Europe.</p>
                        <p>I have had, therefore, to ask myself this question: would talks with the Soviet Union on
       strategic missiles and other matters hurt or help the people of
       Czechoslovakia—and, in a larger sense, would they help or hurt the men and women
       throughout all of Europe? I have concluded that the issue of curbing the strategic arms race
       and carrying forward the struggle to lift from mankind the threat of nuclear war is such an
       overriding issue that we should now go forward. The future of the men and women and children
       of Czechoslovakia is as much bound up in this matter as the future of the human beings in
       every corner of the world.</p>
                        <p>The second consideration which has weighed upon me, bore on my responsibilities and those
       of my successor. I have asked myself this question: would it be right to open these talks
       when it is likely that the negotiations will stretch out into the time when another man bears
       the responsibilities of the Presidency?</p>
                        <p>I have concluded that it is right to carry forward to the stage of initial negotiation this
       enterprise which I launched almost five years ago. I am comforted in doing so because the
       position our negotiators will take to the discussions is one agreed in detail by the military
       and civil authorities throughout the United States Government. We are going in on solid
       ground. My successor will be in a position—should the negotiations proceed into
       his time, as I expect—to lay his hand on critical matters that may have to be
       faced before a final agreement is reached.</p>
                        <p>We have, of course, kept our fighting allies informed of the course of the negotiations in
       Paris. They have been informed also of the circumstances which have led me to conclude that
       it is now worth taking the risks of a total cessation of bombardment of North Vietnam.
       Nevertheless, we are seven governments which have been in the trenches together. We shall be
       fighting side by side still in the weeks ahead, while working shoulder to shoulder equally
       for a stable, honorable peace in Southeast Asia. And beyond that we shall be
       together—with many others—in helping build the security and prosperity
       of the whole region in the postwar years.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, after consultation with the governments concerned, I have thought it wise to
       meet with the leaders of South Vietnam, Korea, Thailand, Philippines, Australia, and New
       Zealand. We shall be gathering in Bangkok on ——- to share our thoughts
       on the war, on <pb n="724" xml:id="pg_724" facs="0752"/>negotiations, and on the future
       stability and prosperity of Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>The evolution of events in Central Europe, the Middle East, and Asia are, of course, of
       great concern to our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies. They also have a vital
       interest in the problem of seeking to limit strategic weapons between the United States and
       the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>We have been in the closest consultation through <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
       since the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, examining together the implications for the
       defense of the West of that action. In the light of those consultations and in the light of
       developments I am describing to you tonight, I have suggested to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> leaders that we might all meet in Brussels on ——-.</p>
                        <p>We have clearly come to a critical moment in the history of this very small planet. As your
       President, I have made the pursuit of a stable peace—with honor and dignity for
       all—my first concern since my first day in office. As I set out now to these three
       meetings, on my final pilgrimage for peace, I ask for your support and your prayers.</p>

                        <p>A separate talking paper has been prepared covering multinational issues which you may wish
       to raise with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, such as Berlin, the Middle East
       and Viet–Nam.<note n="2" xml:id="d306fn2">Not printed. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>More routine bilateral issues are discussed below for the event that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> may wish to raise any of them—perhaps to
       test our present <pb n="725" xml:id="pg_725" facs="0753"/>attitude and to demonstrate Soviet
       interest in proceeding with business as usual. The moment does not appear appropriate for you
       to raise any of these issues yourself. Should <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
       choose to discuss any of the following issues, you may wish to respond along the lines
       indicated below.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Opening of Consulates</p>
                        <p>The Soviets followed up several informal approaches to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> last spring regarding the establishment of consulates
       by proposing formally on August 13 that we establish a Consulate General in Leningrad in
       exchange for a Soviet Consulate General in San Francisco.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommended U.S. Position</p>
                        <p>You may wish to remind <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> of your obligation to
       consult with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee before talks on consulates are begun with
       the Soviets and observe that the present does not appear to be a favorable time for such
       consultations. However, we continue to have the matter under study.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Chancery Sites</p>
                        <p>The two unresolved issues concern the amount of land to be exchanged and the terms for
       renting Spasso House. Recent negative comments by Congressman Wayne Hays about the whole
       project, following the invasion of Czechoslovakia, is a new element.</p>
                        <pb n="726" xml:id="pg_726" facs="0754"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommended U.S. Position</p>
                        <p>If <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> raises the issue, you may wish to stress
       that the final decision on the amount of land to be exchanged must stand up to Congressional
       scrutiny, in order to permit early signature of an agreement. In this connection, we hope
       that the chancery site in Moscow will include the triangular piece of land in dispute. We are
       prepared to continue to pay our present rental for Spasso House until the present lease
       expires in 1985, and then renegotiate at the going diplomatic rate at five–year
       intervals.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Proposal for Discussion of Naval Incidents</p>
                        <p>Following the crash of a Soviet TU–16 aircraft in the Norwegian Sea while
       conducting hazardous buzzing operations around the USS Essex, we reaffirmed on August 13 our
       proposal of April 11, 1968, that U.S. and Soviet representatives meet to discuss ways of
       avoiding incidents at sea.<note n="3" xml:id="d306fn3">See <ref target="#d284">Document
         284</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommended U.S. Position</p>
                        <p>If <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> indicates willingness to discuss this
       proposal, we suggest that you confirm our continued desire for such a meeting and propose
       that the details be worked out between the Soviet Embassy and the Department.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Offer of Navigational Equipment</p>
                        <p>Following the incident of the Seaboard airliner, which violated
       Soviet–controlled airspace and was forced to land, we delivered a note<note n="4" xml:id="d306fn4">Not found.</note> to the Soviet Foreign Ministry on August 15 offering to
       lease navigational equipment to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> at a nominal cost
       for installation along the North Pacific route. We also renewed our request for additional
       information on Soviet navigational aids in the area. The Soviets have not responded to our
       approach, although a Soviet official in Moscow inquired on August 20 what we meant by
       “nominal cost,” indicating some Soviet interest. In order to
       demonstrate Soviet interest in returning to business as usual, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> could indicate a favorable response to our proposal.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommended U.S. Position</p>
                        <p>If raised by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, you may wish to tell him that
       our offer still stands and that we would be prepared to move ahead on this proposal, since it
       is in our mutual interest to do so.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">5. Law of the Sea Talks</p>
                        <p>U.S. and Soviet experts held exploratory talks in Washington July 13–23
       concerning a possible Law of the Sea Conference. A second round of talks was scheduled to
       begin in Moscow on September 30; however, on September 16, we informed the Soviet Embassy
       that we did not consider it appropriate to resume discussions on the planned date.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommended U.S. Position</p>
                        <p>If <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> should inquire as to possible
       rescheduling, you may tell him that we have the matter under consideration and hope
       discussions might resume at an appropriate time.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">6. Port Security</p>
                        <p>Last spring, the Soviets revived a proposal for talks on entry of Soviet ships into U.S.
       ports and American ships into Soviet ports. We informed the Soviet Embassy on June 26, that
       since the proposal was raised within the context of entry for fishing vessels, it would be
       appropriate to defer the question until the next round of fisheries negotiations. It is
       possible that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> may refer to the longstanding
       Soviet <pb n="727" xml:id="pg_727" facs="0755"/>proposal for talks on port entry and urge
       that discussions take place independently of the fisheries talks.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommended U.S. Position</p>
                        <p>If <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> raises the question, you may point out
       that the next round of fisheries talks will probably be held in December. We believe these
       talks would be the most suitable forum for consideration of the matter, since representatives
       of domestic fishing interests, who are vitally concerned in this question, will be on our
       delegation. You may also wish to comment that it is a poor time to consider concessions on
       this question, in the light of Czechoslovakia.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">7. Fisheries Matters</p>
                        <p>Both the Atlantic and the Pacific Fisheries Agreements with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will come up for renegotiation at the end of the year. We desire to proceed
       with the renegotiation and have tentatively planned for the talks to take place in
       Washington, beginning on December 4 for the Atlantic Agreement and January 8 for the Pacific
       Agreement. In order to prepare for these talks, we have gone ahead with a joint <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–Soviet inspection exchange, permitted the Soviet
       research vessel “Blesk” to visit Woods Hole, Massachusetts, for a
       program of joint research, and continued plans for expert talks in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in October.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommended U.S. Position</p>
                        <p>If <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> should mention the fisheries agreements,
       you might say that we believe they are in our mutual interest and desire their continuation.
       Cooperation in the fisheries field has benefitted both sides and we hope it can be
       maintained.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">8. Jamming of <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> protested to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on September 19 over the jamming since August 21 of
        <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> broadcasts to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
       in the Russian, Ukrainian, Georgian and Armenian languages. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> argued in familiar rebuttal that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has a sovereign right to protect itself against hostile propaganda. He claimed
       that jamming does not violate the International Telecommunication Convention—which
       we dispute.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommended U.S. Position</p>
                        <p>If <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> should reiterate these views, you may
       wish to point out that by reinstituting jamming, associated with the “cold
       war,” the Soviets only feed the suspicions and tensions generated by their
       invasion of Czechoslovakia. You may wish to express your regret over this action which runs
       counter to our deeply–felt belief that freedom of information helps build mutual
       understanding between peoples and a peaceful world.</p>
                        <pb n="728" xml:id="pg_728" facs="0756"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">9. <persName corresp="#p_IIA1">Ivanov</persName> Case</p>
                        <p>Convicted spy, <persName corresp="#p_IIA1">Igor Ivanov</persName>, former Amtorg chauffeur,
       has been free on $100,000 bail since late 1963, pending appeals. The Supreme Court has set
       arguments in the case for October and will probably hand down its decision before December.
       The legal issue involved is whether wire tap evidence can be examined in camera or must be
       disclosed to the defense. If the Court insists on disclosure, Justice will be forced to
       dismiss the indictment and <persName corresp="#p_IIA1">Ivanov</persName> will go free. The
       Soviets have made assiduous high–level efforts to bring about <persName corresp="#p_IIA1">Ivanov</persName>'s release.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommended U.S. Position</p>
                        <p>Should <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> raise the case again, you may point
       out that it is presently before the Supreme Court and that arguments in the case will be
       heard this fall. If <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> should ask what action has
       been taken on the clemency petition submitted by <persName corresp="#p_IIA1">Ivanov</persName>'s parents, you may respond that consideration of this petition
       has been suspended for the time being. You may also wish to point out that the Soviet
       invasion of Czechoslovakia has made it more difficult for us to examine ways in which the
       case could be resolved favorably for the Soviet side.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">10. Social Security Payments</p>
                        <p>In June, we lifted the prohibition on the payment of Social Security annuities to persons
       in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> (Treasury Circular 655) and took steps to
       arrange for payments. A Social Security representative was in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to discuss the establishment of verification procedures, when the Soviets
       marched into Czechoslovakia, and he returned without meeting with the Soviets. It was decided
       that talks should be deferred, and that we would take another look at the matter next spring.
       The Soviet Embassy has indicated that it is receiving queries from potential recipients, who
       contemplate returning to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommended U.S. Position</p>
                        <p>In the event that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> raised the question, you
       may wish to say that we do not feel the moment is opportune to hold such talks now.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">11. Exchanges</p>
                        <p>We have cancelled high visibility programs scheduled for this fall, but we are continuing
       low visibility exchanges involving scientists, researchers, graduate students and professors
       under agreed quotas. The Soviets have complained that our
       “unjustifiable” cancellation of the Minnesota Symphonic Band involved a
       considerable loss to Goskontsert, the Soviet sponsor.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommended U.S. Position</p>
                        <p>In the event that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> should ask about our
       intentions with regard to the balance of the recently concluded Exchanges Agreement, <pb n="729" xml:id="pg_729" facs="0757"/>you may wish to tell him that it is not our present
       intention to suspend the Agreement. However, the United States Government and people did not
       consider the Minnesota tour appropriate in the light of the Soviet action against
       Czechoslovakia. For its part, the Soviet Union in the recent past has cancelled or postponed
       various scheduled cultural exchange groups for less valid reasons.</p>

                        <p>I read it over and asked him if he had any further observations to make. He said that he

                        <p>I said that the portion dealing with offensive and defensive strategic missiles seemed to

       important communication which Rostow had given to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>.</p>
                        <p>On the Middle East, I asked if he had received the reply which <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> had given to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on
        Sunday.<note n="3" xml:id="d307fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> handed <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> the 7–page paper, which was a reply to a paper that
         <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> gave <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> on September 4 (see <ref target="#d295fn6">footnote 6, Document 295</ref>)
        during a meeting on September 29.</note> He said that he had received it just as he had
       reached the airport but had not yet had a chance to read it or study it. I then said that it
       might be desirable for us to have a further discussion on the Middle East after he had had a
       chance to consider our reply.</p>
                        <p>His own comments were as follows: On strategic missiles he said that the Soviet Union was
       serious about this question. It involved not <pb n="730" xml:id="pg_730" facs="0758"/>only
       economic and financial aspects of the arms race but also involved increasing dangers to both
       sides. After a number of exchanges on this matter I concluded that the Soviets were seriously
       interested and that they were trying to make some significant progress.</p>
                        <p>On Viet–Nam <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the Paris
       talks were not getting anywhere on substance even though there was a broader understanding on
       both sides of the other side's viewpoint. He said that they much appreciated the
       fact that we had kept them informed in some detail about the Paris talks and that Hanoi had
       done the same. I pointed out that, in that case, the Soviets were probably the best informed
       people in the world as to the negotiating situation since they were getting detailed
       information from both sides. He said modesty prevented his making that point but that it was
       probably correct.</p>
                        <p>He said he had two questions to put to me about Viet–Nam. The first was whether
       the presence of the South Vietnamese at the conference table was the sole obstacle to
       stopping the bombing. I told him that this was a most important issue and, in some respects,
       might be the most difficult for Hanoi to accept. But I called his attention to the fact that
       in Rostow's communication to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> we
       had described three matters as simple facts of life. The President could not maintain a
       cessation of the bombing if there were abuses of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, if
       there were rockets and mortars slamming into population centers such as Saigon, Danang and
       Hue and if North Viet–Nam did not sit down promptly in negotiations at which the
        <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would be present. I emphasized that it was not necessary
       to talk about “conditions”, “reciprocity” or
       “quid pro quos.” It was simply an elementary fact that no President of
       the United States could maintain a cessation of the bombing under certain circumstances and
       we had tried to be explicit to the Soviet Union about such circumstances.</p>
                        <p>His second question was whether we could eliminate <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName> and Ky as parties to the situation. He said we should not draw any
       conclusions from the question—he was merely asking a question. He said that the
       authorities in Hanoi took a very strong view toward these individuals and that the character
       of the regime in the South was a major obstacle. I replied very firmly that we could not go
       down this path. President <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName> and Prime Minister
       Huong together represented 45 percent of the votes cast in the last Presidential election in
       South Viet–Nam. They, too, had some strong views about the authorities in Hanoi
       but they were willing to negotiate with them and were willing to let them have the NLF on
       their side of the table. I made it very clear that there was no possibility that we would
       bring about a change in government in Saigon to accommodate Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then said that there were three parties
       involved in these communications: the North Vietnamese, the Soviet Union and the <pb n="731" xml:id="pg_731" facs="0759"/>United States. He said that the United States ought to take
       into account the problem which Moscow faces in its own dealings with Hanoi and that we should
       put Moscow in a position to use its influence in Hanoi in a constructive direction. He
       illustrated his point by saying that if we told the Soviet Union that we would have to resume
       the bombing on this or that condition, the Soviets would have to say that to Hanoi. Hanoi, in
       turn, would then say to the Soviet Union “what have you done—have you
       sold out to the Americans?” I tried to get him to be more specific about just what
       he had in mind but all I could get was a statement that the atmosphere would be greatly
       changed if we stopped the bombing and vague allusions to what might happen if we did so.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, I told <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that it was very
       important that the United States and the Soviet Union be precise with each other and that we
       not mislead each other. He seemed to agree. I reminded him that we had said that if the
       Soviet Union were to give us serious advice about stopping the bombing with full knowledge of
       the “three facts of life”, we would take their advice very seriously
       indeed. We were interested in results; we were not standing on ceremony, we were not
       insisting upon particular procedures, we were not debating who might make the first move, we
       were not interested in face, we were only interested in peace. We were prepared to be
       flexible about procedural and other modalities if we could have reasonable confidence that
       results would follow. Just as <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> has done in
       Washington, he tried to leave the impression that we ought to stop the bombing but he would
       not say that anything specific would result.</p>
                        <p>At one point I told <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that we would be
       interested if the Soviets would tell us, with full understanding of our views, that the
       Soviets would make a maximum effort following a cessation of bombing. He said that he could
       state that they would do so but he refused to confirm that they would do so on the three
       points which we have described as “facts of life”.</p>
                        <p>We had some rather pointless discussion on the Middle East which reflected my own
       discussion with Riad of Egypt the day before. For present purposes, this memorandum will not
       go into that because he and I agreed we should discuss the Middle East on a later
       occasion.</p>
                        <p>During a brief conversation about Czechoslovakia, referring to Rostow's remarks
       on the subject, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> stated quite categorically
       that under no circumstances would the Soviet Union discuss this subject with any other
       government—meaning particularly the United States. I told him about some of the
       problems which this had created for us but he was utterly unwilling to get into it in any
       way.</p>
                        <p>He said, at one point, that the Soviet leaders were ready for a meeting “at any
       time” and that that was a matter for us to consider. I did <pb n="732" xml:id="pg_732" facs="0760"/>not respond on this point but made the general observation that
       I would report our conversation to the President and would be in touch with him further.
        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> fully understands the President's
       personal relation to the Rostow–<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
       exchanges and that only three of us are informed about them.</p>
                        <p>In all of my exchanges with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> since 1961 his
       personal attitude, manner and language were more friendly and agreeable than I have ever
       found him. He seemed to be going out of his way to establish a rapport. I mention this not
       because I think a new day had dawned but because it may be of some interest in thinking about
       the present situation. He told me that he would say some things in his speech tomorrow<note n="4" xml:id="d307fn4">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Izvestia,</hi> October 4; excerpts
        are in <hi rend="italic">The New York Times,</hi> October 4.</note> about
       Viet–Nam that would not surprise me. I replied that I did not believe he was
       surprised by my speech today<note n="5" xml:id="d307fn5">For text, see the Department of
        State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin,</hi> October 21, 1968, pp. 405–410; excerpts
        are in <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>, October 3.</note> in the General Assembly,
       to which he replied “not surprised but I could have hoped you would have said
       something different”.</p>
                        <p>My own impression is that I should go back at him again on Viet–Nam, as well as
       on the Middle East. There is something on his mind which he has not yet fully disclosed. I do
       not believe that we have a basis for acting now on the basis of the
        Rostow–<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> communication. Before I
       see him again, I would wish to have the President's reactions to this first
       contact.</p>

                        <p>President Johnson's observations on the subject of his meeting with Soviet
       leaders which were communicated by W. Rostow to the Soviet Ambassador on September 16<note n="2" xml:id="d308fn2">See <ref target="#d300">Document 300</ref>.</note> have been
       attentively considered in Moscow. In this connection we, for our part, should also like to
       express some ideas.</p>
                        <p>I. It has been noted in Moscow that the President has reacted favorably to our suggestion
       that in the course of the meeting there should be established basic principles affecting the
       limitation and subsequent reduction in strategic armaments. We, for our part, agree that
       simultaneously the general objectives of our two countries in this field should be formulated
       in a more detailed form.</p>
                        <p>On the whole as a result of the exchange of views on the question of restraining the
       strategic arms race it could, in our opinion, be stated that the two sides had arrived at a
       conclusion on the expediency and feasibility of achieving a mutually acceptable understanding
       on this question, and that the implementation of measures to restrain the strategic arms race
       would answer to the interests of both our countries as well as to the interests of
       strengthening international security, and that this would also generate more favorable
       conditions for solving other major issues in the field of disarmament.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, it could be agreed that the two sides would be guided by the following
       general objectives:</p>
                        <p>—To achieve and maintain a stable U.S.–Soviet strategic deterrence by
       agreed limitations on the deployment of offensive and defensive strategic armaments.</p>
                        <p>—To enhance the credibility of our efforts to prevent the destabilizing actions
       of other nations by demonstrating Soviet and U.S. willingness to limit their strategic
       armaments.</p>
                        <p>—To provide mutual assurance to each of us that our security will be maintained,
       while at the same time avoiding the tensions, uncertainties, and costs of an unrestrained
       continuation of the strategic arms race.</p>
                        <p>—To improve U.S.–Soviet understanding by establishing a continuing
       process of discussion of issues arising from the strategic situation.</p>
                        <pb n="734" xml:id="pg_734" facs="0762"/>
                        <p>At the same time it could be agreed that the task of limiting and subsequently reducing
       strategic armaments should be resolved in compliance with the following basic principles:</p>
                        <p>(1) The limitation and reduction in strategic armaments should be carried out with due
       regard for the integral interconnection of the two principal components of such armaments,
       i.e. offensive and defensive weapons systems.</p>
                        <p>(2) The limitation and reduction in strategic armaments should be carried out as a complex
       including both offensive strategic nuclear weapons delivery systems and
       anti–ballistic missile systems.</p>
                        <p>(3) The limitation and reduction in strategic armaments should be so balanced that neither
       side could obtain any military advantages and that equal security should be assured for both
       sides.</p>
                        <p>There could also be registered an agreement of the two sides, along with implementation of
       measures to limit and reduce strategic armaments, to study the question of taking steps to
       rule out the accidental appearance of conflict—fraught situations involving the
       use of strategic armaments.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion it could be agreed that special delegations of the two governments, guided by
       the above–mentioned objectives and principles, would promptly address themselves
       to devizing an agreement on the concrete aspects of the problem of limiting and reducing
       strategic armaments.</p>
                        <p>[1.] Agreement, reached during the meeting, on the above–listed aspects of the
       problem of limiting and reducing strategic armaments could, in our view, then be set forth
       either in the final communiqué of the meeting or in the form of a joint statement
       of our two governments.</p>
                        <p>2. There is agreement in Moscow that the achievement of progress towards a peaceful
       settlement of the Vietnam problem would be highly desirable.</p>
                        <p>Our understanding of what is required to secure such progress has already been communicated
       to the President and we are forming the impression that our position in this regard has, in
       general, been correctly understood by the American side. However, an exchange of views during
       the meeting on this topic as well could, we feel, prove useful.<note n="3" xml:id="d308fn3">In an October 2 memorandum to the President, Rostow highlighted the exchanges with the
        Soviets on Vietnam by providing excerpts from this message and <ref target="#d299">Documents
         299</ref> and <ref target="#d307">307</ref>. He then passed on the following warning from
         <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: “Under no circumstances must
         <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> know of these exchanges, he would
        resign.” (Johnson Library, National Security File, Rostow Files, Chlodnick
        File)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. The deep concern about the explosive situation in the Middle East stated by the
       President and the desire he has expressed to assist in bringing about peace in that area as
       quickly as possible as well as <pb n="735" xml:id="pg_735" facs="0763"/>his readiness to
       exchange views with the Soviet Union on this very important part of the world, have been
       taken note of in Moscow.</p>
                        <p>We believe it would be important and useful, without needlessly going into details which
       are subject to further consideration at other levels, to exchange views during the meeting
       and to register our agreement regarding the need to take all measures to bring about a
       peaceful settlement of the Middle East conflict and to prevent the resumption of hostilities
       in that area.</p>
                        <p>4. The conviction expressed by the President that a realistic and genuine understanding
       between our two countries is of vital importance to the assurance of a general peace and his
       desire that in the days and weeks ahead a good foundation could be laid for further
       development of Soviet–American relations in the future have been taken note of in
       Moscow with gratification. This corresponds also to our approach to relations with the U.S.,
       including the question of a forthcoming summit meeting.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>In re–reading the communication which <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> gave to Sec. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> on Wednesday
        night,<note n="2" xml:id="d309fn2">October 2; see <ref target="#d308">Document
        308</ref>.</note> it appears that they are suggesting a meeting which would be guaranteed
       before the event to be modestly fruitful with regard to strategic weapons talks. But they are
       saying that a Vietnamese formula probably cannot be established before the meeting and,
       therefore, the Vietnamese question should be discussed at the meeting. This is how I read the
       following passage:</p>
                        <p>“Our understanding of what is required to secure such progress has already been
       communicated to the President and we are forming the impression that our position in this
       regard has, in general, been correctly understood by the American side. However an exchange
       of views during the meeting on this topic as well could, we feel, prove
       useful.”</p>
                        <pb n="736" xml:id="pg_736" facs="0764"/>
                        <p>With respect to Czechoslovakia, while they will not talk with us directly, obviously
        <persName corresp="#p_DA1">Dubcek</persName> is in Moscow and they are trying to get the
       best settlement they can wring from him and announce some kind of schedule of troop
       withdrawals. (I do not rule out that they will decide they cannot get an acceptable situation
       from <persName corresp="#p_DA1">Dubcek</persName> and go into a much harder phase in
       Czechoslovakia.)</p>
                        <p>But you may wish to think about a situation which could emerge in the next several days in
       which there was:</p>
                        <p>—A sharp turn for the better in Czechoslovakia;</p>
                        <p>—A clear possibility of a successful meeting on strategic missiles at the
       highest level;</p>
                        <p>—But the formula for a bombing cessation and serious talks had not yet been
       achieved but was on the agenda for, say, Geneva, as well as for discussion in Paris.</p>
                        <p>This is not a recommendation, but the posing of a possible contingency.</p>
                        <p>New but related subject: <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said something
       interesting but mysterious in his General Assembly speech.<note n="3" xml:id="d309fn3">See
         <ref target="#d307fn4">footnote 4, Document 307</ref>.</note> With respect to Vietnam, he
       said that after a bombing cessation, serious progress towards peace could be made in
       Paris—“or elsewhere.”</p>
                        <p>I do not, of course, know what he has in mind. But it is possible that we will be presented
       with a formula in which:</p>

                        <p>—When we say that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> must also talk about

       can a legitimate government enter into negotiations on these issues.</p>
                        <p>In short, Hanoi may come back at us with a split negotiation, not unlike the

       tough because there is a certain legitimacy in getting at the political settlement in the

       for the South Vietnamese, not for Hanoi or Washington.</p>

                        <p>After dinner I drew Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> aside into a small
       drawing room and had a talk with him alone.</p>
                        <p>I started by emphasizing the importance and seriousness of the Rostow–<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> discussions and said that the President was personally
       and directly involved in all aspects of those conversations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said they understood this and attached the highest importance to such
       discussions.</p>
                        <p>I then said that we had been giving further thought to what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had said to me in my call on him at his Mission about
       Moscow's problem in dealing with Hanoi.<note n="2" xml:id="d310fn2">See <ref target="#d307">Document 307</ref>.</note> I said that the Soviet Leadership might wish to
       concentrate on the point of the necessity of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> presence in
       any negotiations leaving to us the problem of pursuing other points, such as the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and attacks on population centers, for direct discussions
       between our delegation and the Hanoi delegation in Paris. I wanted to be very clear to Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that I was not in any sense withdrawing the
       importance we attached to such military points as the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and
       attacks on the cities; it was very important that there be no misunderstanding between the
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> on such
       matters. It is a “fact of life” that no President could maintain a
       cessation of bombing if there were abuse of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> or if the
       cities were attacked. However, the question of having the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
       at the conference table required a political decision; if Hanoi agreed this would represent a
       “major development” in the situation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was noncommittal in his comment and repeated
       what he had said earlier about the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> being able to be
       more effective in advising Hanoi if there were a cessation of bombing. I got the impression
       that he listened carefully to the point I made but I could not report that he agreed to act
       on it.</p>
                        <p>He then asked about the portion of their earlier message which discussed general principles
       on strategic missiles and I repeated my earlier statement that I thought that that part of
       their message was constructive, and that we would give them a reply after we have had a
       chance to examine it in detail. He inquired about what our present thought was about a
       possible meeting and I said I had nothing more <pb n="738" xml:id="pg_738" facs="0766"/>to
       say on that subject but that the Rostow–<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> channel should be kept open and available for any further
       discussion.</p>
                        <p>We then adjourned to another room to join our other colleagues for a discussion of the
       Middle East.<note n="3" xml:id="d310fn3">A memorandum of their conversation on the Middle

                        <p>Mr. Secretary:</p>
                        <p>Believe me I am not trying to find out what you have been discussing with Ambassador
        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, but I do venture to express the very strong
       hope that it is not for the purpose of arranging a meeting between the President and
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. Any such meeting at this time would have
       nothing in my opinion but bad effect for the U.S. and its general position in the world.</p>
                        <p>1. It would undo all of the effect of our reaction to the Czech invasion and would undercut
       any attempts that we may make to strengthen <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. It would
       be regarded widely, in Europe particularly, as condoning the Soviet action in Czechoslovakia.
       This is particularly true since the story in Czechoslovakia is by no means over and there may
       be a considerable number of disagreeable and brutal action in the cards for the relatively
       near future.</p>
                        <p>2. It is difficult to see anything that could be constructively accomplished by a meeting
       at this juncture. It would certainly confirm the Soviets in the belief that they can
       virtually do almost anything in the world and still have “business as
       usual” with the U.S. I cannot see any particular agreements that could be
       facilitated by a Summit Meeting that could not be handled through normal diplomatic channels.
       This includes Vietnam and the fixing of a date for the Disarmament Meeting.</p>

                        <p>3. If a possible Summit Meeting has not been the subject of your discussion with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, then I will take back and destroy this
       memorandum.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>I received Amb. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> at my house at 5:00 p.m.
       today, October 25. After brief amenities, I told him that the President wished me to review
       with him, on the same basis that we had earlier met, his concerns about the present situation
       with respect to the Vietnam negotiations.<note n="2" xml:id="d312fn2">The negotiations
        leading up to the bombing halt over North Vietnam on October 31are extensively documented in

        Documentation on the Soviet role is in the Johnson Library, National Security File, Rostow
        Files, Chlodnick File.</note> I explained that the document I was about to give him was a
       personal oral communication reflecting what was on the President's mind.</p>
                        <p>He read the document carefully (Tab A).<note n="3" xml:id="d312fn3">Not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to para. 1,<note n="4" xml:id="d312fn4">Paragraph 1 stated that
        “the situation is made very difficult by reports to the press apparently or
        allegedly from Soviet diplomatic sources, stating that we are very close to an
        agreement.”</note> he said that only he, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, knows fully about the Paris negotiations and communications between
       the U.S. and the Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_TYN1">Tcherniakov</persName>, his DMC,
       knows half the story. No one else in the Embassy has the knowledge to speak with any
       authority on what is happening about Vietnam. When I pointed out to him that we had stories
       alleged to be from diplomatic sources in London, he said he could not assume responsibility
       for the Embassy in London. I said that I had no doubt about the correctness of his own
       behavior in this matter but we were confronted with a fact; namely, that stories were
       appearing, allegedly from Soviet sources; and we were confronted with a second fact; namely,
       that almost every newspaper man who came into <pb n="740" xml:id="pg_740" facs="0768"/>my
       office told me that his favorite Soviet contact was telling him hopeful things about the
       negotiations and how peace was about to break out due to the role of the Soviet Union. He
       said that he had issued instructions to everyone in his Embassy not to talk about Vietnam. We
       ended by my underlining what the memorandum said; namely, that this was a problem for the
       President for the reasons indicated.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then turned to substance. He said that he
       found the memorandum very “disappointing.” He thought we were going
       back to matters which had long since been settled. As he understood the situation in Paris,
       there were three questions. —First, how we refer to the participation of those who
       would take part in the talks. On this matter we had raised a “new
       point” by wanting to get into the secret minute that participation
       “would not involve recognition.” Everyone agreed that
       “recognition” was not involved.</p>
                        <p>—Second, there was the question that the bombing cessation would be
       “unconditional.” He said this was not a matter, in his judgment, of
       great importance. It was not worth sacrificing the whole meeting on this matter. I
       interrupted to point out that my memorandum to him<note n="5" xml:id="d312fn5">Not further
        identified.</note> explained fully why we took the question of
       “unconditional” so seriously. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he now recognized that we attached great importance to the matter
       and would so report.</p>
                        <p>—Third, there was the question of the date of cessation of the bombardment. He
       attached great importance to the fact that the North Vietnamese had set a date; namely,
       November 2. He could not understand why a few days one way or the other were so important to
       us when there were such great issues at stake. We have been arguing, he said, for two weeks
       over the question of 2 days.</p>
                        <p>I said to him it was not quite so simple. From our point of view, we had in good faith put
       in a proposal in mid–October. We had chosen “the next day”
       because of what they had said about beginning serious talks the day after the bombing
       cessation. (<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said this was a new idea to him.
       He had not known that they had mentioned the next day.) I went on to say that having geared
       ourselves to a final decision on the basis of what had been exchanged, Hanoi negotiators had
       then unleashed a great many “rabbits”: a four–power
       conference; a communiqué; a secret minute; several weeks “as a gap
       between the bombing cessation and the first meeting”; no conditions; etc. It was
       Hanoi's behavior with respect to these matters which had deeply concerned the
       President, because they might reflect a lack of understanding of the “facts of
       life” and a lack of understanding of the seriousness of the problems that we faced
       in moving forward, especially at so sensitive a political time.</p>
                        <p>After some elaboration by me of the kinds of pressures represented by recent items on the
       ticker in our political life, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said: <pb n="741" xml:id="pg_741" facs="0769"/>“I now understand better. I thought that
       this message would take us back very far to where we began some months ago; but I should like
       to clear up one serious point: in communicating this message to my government, should I say
       that the President will not proceed with the Paris negotiations until he gets a response from
       the Soviet government on the question raised?” I said that it was my impression
       that the President had merely asked me to convey to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and his government his present concerns. The question he was asking,
       however, was a serious diplomatic question and I would seek an answer.</p>
                        <p>I then called the President and put the issue to him. The President said, no. I do not wish
       to be that hard. I do not wish to commit myself to holding up the Paris negotiations. I would
       wish to know the reaction of the Soviet government to this situation.</p>
                        <p>After this clarification, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> returned to the
       three points at stake in the Paris talks. He said: You and I can talk with brutal frankness
       and if I understand what you are telling me, it is that on one point you are prepared to
       compromise. That is, you are prepared to see the participants listed. But on two points you
       intend to hold firm; that is, on “without conditions” and time. At
       about this point I received a telephone call from Ben Read who told me that we would be
       prepared to tell the North Vietnamese in the context of the secret minute that we did not
       plan to use in formal statements the phrase “conditions.” I informed
       Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> of this fact and said that now we
       were prepared to compromise on one and a half of the three points. It was time for them to
       clear this underbrush away.</p>
                        <p>At this point <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> volunteered the following. He
       had been privileged to get the reports from both our side and from the Hanoi delegation. He
       could attest from his personal knowledge that we had “many, many times”
       made clear the “facts of life.” I asked: “Are you,
       Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, prepared to tell me that they
       understand the ‘facts of life’?” He said, “I can
       only say that from their reports to me as well as your reports to our people in Paris, you
       have expressed yourselves very clearly.”</p>
                        <p>At almost exactly 6:00 p.m., as Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
       was about to leave, he received at my home a telephone call from <persName corresp="#p_TYN1">Tcherniakov</persName>, his <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_TYN1">Tcherniakov</persName> reported that a message to the President from
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had just arrived, on Vietnam. We consulted
       together as to where the message should be delivered. We decided to minimize the chances of a
       leak about our contact and <persName corresp="#p_TYN1">Tcherniakov</persName> would deliver
       the message to my house. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then dispatched his
       car to pick up</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TYN1">Tcherniakov</persName>, and we settled down to await him. (Up to
       this point, contrary to his custom, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> did not
       have a Scotch. He accepted, while awaiting <persName corresp="#p_TYN1">Tcherniakov</persName>.)</p>
                        <pb n="742" xml:id="pg_742" facs="0770"/>
                        <p>During the interval, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> raised with me the
       question of missile talks. Where do we stand? I said that while the matter was still on the
       President's mind, he was much concentrated on the question of Vietnam. I then
       asked: “Was it true that the Warsaw Pact forces are moving out of
       Czechoslovakia?” He hastened to tell me that Bulgarian, Hungarian, and Polish as
       well as some Soviet forces were moving out of Czechoslovakia. He added, gratuituously, that
       there never had been any German forces in Czechoslovakia—which, I take it, will be
       the Soviet mythology in the face of protests of the other occupying powers of Germany.</p>
                        <p>He indicated his view that it would be a good thing if we could get on with the missile
       talks.</p>
                        <p>I took the occasion of the break to say that, on a strictly personal basis, if I had any
       advice to give the leaders of Hanoi, it would be to go very rapidly for a definitive
       settlement in Southeast Asia once the new phase of talks opened, assuming we could surmount
       present problems. I recalled that it only took a month's hard work in Geneva in
       1954. He asked me why I thought there was urgency. I said there were two reasons:</p>
                        <p>—First, there would be a wave of expectation and goodwill in the U.S. in the
       wake of a bombing cessation, quiet at the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, quiet in the
       cities, and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> participation in Paris. But he had to
       remember that this was a country which had a scar on its heart over Panmunjom. If the talks
       dragged on, there would be grave disappointment.</p>
                        <p>—Second, as he could see from the polls, this country was undergoing a swing
       towards conservatism. This has happened before in our history, but it was clear that
       something like 60% of the people were for <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> or
       Wallace. I could not predict what would happen if there was protracted frustration in the
       movement towards peace. It was my personal judgment, however, that there would be strong
       pressures to apply more military power in Vietnam rather than less.</p>
                        <p>I concluded by saying that in my quite objective judgment, it would be wise for the leaders
       of Hanoi to seize this moment and work with President Johnson towards the position he first
       outlined in his Johns Hopkins speech;<note n="6" xml:id="d312fn6">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>, 1965,</hi> Book I, pp.

       associated itself not with China but with the other countries of Southeast Asia in
       constructive efforts at development. Only in this way was North Vietnam likely to maintain
       its independence. (<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> showed surprising interest
       and concentration as I made this point.)</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then gave me the following informal
       translation.</p>
                        <p>“Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>“Information we are receiving from official representatives of the United States
       as well as from the representatives of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, shows that
       there is now beginning a very important movement in the U.S.–Vietnamese
       negotiations in Paris.</p>
                        <p>“Judging from this information, the position of the two sides on the cessation
       of bombardment, etc., is much closer. And the possibility of reaching an agreement on this
       question is quite real.</p>
                        <p>“By such an agreement we could lay the basis for a beginning of a breakthrough
       towards a political settlement of the Vietnam problem.</p>
                        <p>“If this possibility which now exists is missed—the development of
       events could go in a different direction.</p>
                        <p>“We are convinced that it is necessary that both sides show understanding and
       responsibility at this moment.</p>
                        <p>“In this connection, we should like to tell you quite frankly, Mr. President,
       that we are not completely convinced that the American side's actions in Paris
       have proceeded from this particular understanding of the situation.</p>
                        <p>“We are concerned that the achievement of an agreement in Paris on the cessation
       of the bombing of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and the beginning of subsequent
       political talks with participation of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, NLF, U.S. and
       the Saigon administration could be torpedoed because of details of third importance which, in
       reality, do not have any significance.</p>
                        <p>“We would like to hope that the government of the United States would understand
       its responsibility in connection with the present negotiations in Paris and would not let
       these negotiations to break but would use them to open the way to a peaceful settlement of
       the Vietnam problem, based on the respect of the legitimate rights and hopes of the
       Vietnamese people which correspond with the interest of the people of the United States and
       the peoples of the whole world.”</p>
                        <p>On a wholly personal basis, I made the following observations to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on this letter.</p>
                        <p>First, I would, of course, promptly communicate it to the President and to Secretary
        <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>. Second, I found it good that on both sides there
       was an impulse to communicate when a matter of concern arose affecting the peace. Third, as
       my communication to him revealed, the President felt concerns of first importance in the
       light of the positions taken by North Vietnam, which Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had described as third importance. The question of conditions and of
       timing were, from our point of view, major matters.</p>
                        <p>He said that the communication, which I had given him, and our discussion had made this
       clear and he would so inform his government.</p>
                        <pb n="744" xml:id="pg_744" facs="0772"/>
                        <p>As we went out to our respective cars, I looked at my watch and said: “Anatoliy,
       it is now midnight in Paris. You'd better get to work to clear up these issues of
       third importance.” He said he would get busy but he didn't know what he
       could accomplish before the morning meeting in Paris.</p>
                        <p>Upon returning to my office, I then reported to the President that we had received the
       message from <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and briefly summarized its
       substance.</p>
                        <p>The President instructed me that, after checking with Sec. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, I should make the following points to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>.</p>
                        <p>“I have informed the President of Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s message and he wished me to convey to you immediately the
       following points:</p>
                        <p>1. The President is gratified that both the Chairman and he were thinking of same problem
       at the same time.</p>
                        <p>2. The President has tried and is trying to find answers to these problems but has been
       unable to persuade the other side to meet us on acceptable terms. Perhaps Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> can help. Perhaps he can try to help move us
       closer.</p>
                        <p>3. The President wishes you to know that the points I made to you this afternoon are, in
       effect, his response to Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. They
       represent the anxieties on the President's mind.</p>
                        <p>4. The President agrees with Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> that
       this is a critical phase. He would welcome any assistance the Chairman can give us in getting
       these issues solved. The President believes that, with the passage of a few more days, this
       possibility for progress might move away from us.”</p>
                        <p>After briefing Sec. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and reporting the
       President's four–point message, he suggested that I add the following
       additional point.</p>
                        <p>5. Therefore, the President believes that both sides should push these issues of third
       importance quickly aside and get on with the real business, which is making peace.</p>
                        <p>I then telephoned Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and twice
       repeated these five points for urgent transmission to Moscow.</p>

                        <p>In a memorandum to the President composed at midnight on October 27, 1968, <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName> recounted his meeting earlier that evening with
       Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. “I then
       explained bluntly the President's dilemma in having to take such a major step [as
       halting the bombing of North Vietnam] at such a critical political period in the U.S. with
       nothing more from Hanoi or Moscow than assent by silence. I indicated the importance that the
       President attached to some positive indication from the Soviet Union that there was reason to
       believe that it was Hanoi's intent to honor the understanding on the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and the cities.” (Johnson Library, National Security
       File, Rostow Files, Chlodnick File) Rostow handed <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> an oral communication that specified the three assumptions on which the
       President was proceeding in the negotiations—that the South Vietnamese would be
       received at the conference that followed the bombing halt and that, while discussions
       continued, North Vietnam would “respect” the demilitarized zone and
       South Vietnam's cities. The communication stated further that the President was
       “proceeding on these assumptions in the belief that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> understands them and ‘has reason to
       believe’ that if the bombing stopped productive discussion could promptly
       follow.” The President was “very anxious to have any comments or
       reaction Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> may have to these three
       points” and would “carefully weigh Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s observations before making a decision.”
       (Ibid.)</p>
                        <p>On October 28 the Soviet Government passed the following note to the U.S. Government:</p>
                        <p>“The progress made at the meetings in Paris between representatives of the DRV
       and the United States on the halt of the bombings of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>,
       on the opening of political negotiations and on the participants of these negotiations, is
       being noted with satisfaction in Moscow.</p>
                        <p>“The representatives of the United States in Paris have had more than once an
       opportunity [to get convinced in] to become sure of the seriousness of intentions of the
       Vietnamese side in the search for mutually acceptable solutions. The Vietnamese leaders have
       repeatedly told us as well about the seriousness of their intentions. The most recent facts,
       in our view, convincingly prove, that the Vietnamese side is doing everything possible to put
       an end to the war in Vietnam and reach a peaceful settlement on the basis of respect for the
       legitimate rights of the Vietnamese people.</p>
                        <p>“In this connection, it seems to us that doubts with regard to the position of
       the Vietnamese side are without foundation (groundless).” (Ibid. Brackets in the
       quoted paragraph.)</p>

                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_KGM1">Kornienko</persName>, Chief USA Section <gloss target="#t_MFA1">MFA</gloss>, called me early November 11 to say that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, informed of <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s brief visit to Moscow en route Afghanistan and recalling
       their meeting at Glassboro, would be pleased to receive him at Kremlin office same afternoon.
        <persName corresp="#p_KGM1">Kornienko</persName> indicated he aware <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> on strictly private visit as tourist.<note n="2" xml:id="d314fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> was President of the International Bank for
        Reconstruction and Development; he stepped down as Secretary of Defense on February 28,
        1968.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Although this unsolicited invitation came as a surprise, it was evident that it could
       not be rejected without serious diplomatic repercussions. Meeting took place in <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s office and lasted for one hour and
       forty–five minutes. Besides principals, an interpreter, a Soviet
       note–taker, <persName corresp="#p_KGM1">Kornienko</persName> and I attended.</p>
                        <p>3. After pleasantries, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, who appeared relaxed
       and considerably more at ease than <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had
       remembered him at Glassboro, introduced subject of Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, disclaiming competence on this question since his departure from
       government, countered by introducing as topic his continuing interest in moving toward
       meaningful negotiations on limitation and reduction of strategic and other arms. At least
       half of subsequent conversation revolved about this topic.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> immediately inquired as to position of
       President–elect <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> on missile talks. He
       then went on to say that <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> adheres to its former (read
       pre–Czechoslovakia) position that military budgets have reached impossible levels
       and that increasing them further could have unpredictable consequences. He said that <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will cooperate in seeking further disarmament measures, will
       try to secure general adherence to <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, and will follow
       course of “general lessening of tension.”</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> replied that American people share
       these objectives. There followed a discursive analysis of whether mutual trust—a
       phrase introduced by <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>—need precede
       negotiations on limiting and reducing strategic delivery systems. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> pointed out that suspicions arising from differences
       in philosophy, political systems, power relationships, and history cannot be eliminated at
       once but that these need not hinder initiation of talks. He said he would have preferred <pb n="747" xml:id="pg_747" facs="0775"/>talks to start two years ago. However complicated,
       difficult, and extensive they might prove to be, they were worth the effort.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> interjected that “both sides
       have enough.” He described alternatives to disarmament as “insanity and
       war” and asserted that serious negotiations are essential. He then asked <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> why <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> so suspicious
       of Soviet motives. <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> now spending 75 to 80 billion dollars
       per year on armaments and defense. This he described a “colossal”
       figure. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said his military advisers had asked
       for more, to which <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> replied, with a smile,
       “military will usually ask for everything.”</p>
                        <p>7. On <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> suspicions of Soviet motives, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> pointed out that philosophic and pragmatic
       differences between <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> are so great decades will be required to eliminate them. He said he saw no
       need to suspend arms talks in interim since mutual advantages, first in lessening dangers of
       nuclear conflagration and of mutual destruction, second in budgetary savings, underline need
       to proceed with talks as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>8. After alleging that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government had set first link in
       chain of mutual suspicions by intervening against newly emerged Soviet Russia 48 years ago,
        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> struck a more serious note. He admitted
       existence of deep philosophic and pragmatic differences between our nations and said that
       “these exist and will continue to exist: they are irreconcilable.”
       Despite these fundamental differences, he continued, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
       proceeds from policy of peaceful coexistence, “as old as Lenin.” Our
       nations should proceed on this principle, irrespective of differing philosophies. Disarmament
       is an “imperative necessity,” not because <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is weak or that “we need it more than you.” Soviet
       “humanistic society” favors disarmament as matter of principle. <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> adheres to position favoring a
       “gradual” solution of disarmament problems. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> responded by rejecting thesis that Soviet society
       more humanistic than American and by emphasizing risks in further accumulation means of
       mutual destruction and political and economic advantages of arms reductions.</p>
                        <p>9. During remainder of conversation <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> (a)
       inquired into financial policies and resources of IBRD without indicating more than polite
       interest; and (b) asked <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> whether he believed
       US truck manufacturers would have some interest in <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as
       market for production technology (<persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> requires a sharp increase in truck production and highly
       evaluates <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> experience in this field). Full memcon on these
       topics and on conversation on disarmament summarized above will be pouched.<note n="3" xml:id="d314fn3">A memorandum of conversation, drafted by <persName corresp="#p_SEC1">Swank</persName>, is in the National Archives and Records Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1967–69, POL <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</note>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s impression is that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> displayed infinitely more interest in disarmament
       generally and in talks on limitation and reduction of strategic delivery systems in
       particular than at Glassboro eighteen months ago. Despite <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s disclaimer, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> believes that cost of escalating strategic arms and consequent impact
       on other essential problems is vital ingredient of <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s very apparent interest in getting talks under way.</p>
                        <p>11. For man whose face easily reflects tension and fatigue, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> looked relatively relaxed and composed, he nevertheless frequently
       seemed at once assertive and defensive about Soviet accomplishments, noting that
       “even Tashkent wants a subway now,” recalling Soviet aid to Afghanistan
       (“marvelous engineering of mountain roads, natural gas lines, irrigation projects,
       etc.”), and asserting that despite expected rise in auto production <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will avoid congestion of New York, Paris Rome and London.
       Despite these boastful interludes, he was amiable throughout conversation.</p>
                        <p>12. Without reading more into conversation than it merits, we nevertheless think it
       noteworthy that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> took initiative for this
       meeting. He obviously had missile talks and Soviet truck production on his mind, but he was
       probably also prepared to hold forth on Vietnam had <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> led conversation in that direction. It seems to me that primary
       significance of meeting may lie in fact <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was
       making gesture of friendship to first distinguished American of his acquaintance who has come
       through Moscow since August invasion of Czechoslovakia. That subject, incidentally, did not

                        <p>At luncheon today Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked me what
       I thought could or should happen in Soviet–American relations during the period
       from the present time until the inauguration of the new administration.<note n="2" xml:id="d315fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard Nixon</persName> defeated <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Hubert Humphrey</persName> in the presidential election on November 5.</note> He asked
       whether we would simply have to mark time or whether there were some problems on which
       progress could be made.</p>
                        <p>I referred to the public statements by the President and the President–Elect
       following their meeting yesterday<note n="3" xml:id="d315fn3">For text of their public
        statements, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States:
          <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>, 1968,</hi> Book II, pp.
        1119–1120. A record of their meeting, during which they discussed the transition
        and reviewed major foreign policy issues, is at the Johnson Library, Tom
        Johnson's Notes of Meetings. Also attending were <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CCM1">Clifford</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>,
        Rostow, and Tom Johnson. According to the record of the meeting, the possibility of a
        U.S.–U.S.S.R. summit meeting was not discussed.</note> but said I had no
       information other than that which had appeared in the press. I felt sure that if possible we
       should try to make progress on such international problems as the Middle East and, of course,
       Viet–Nam. In connection with the latter problem I mentioned the reports of
       violations of the DMZ and said I trusted his government realized how serious these
       developments were.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he was quite sure that
       the North Vietnamese did not intend to break down the agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador raised the question of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and referred
       to the statement by Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> that he might
       bring this up with the new Congress as soon as it was convened. I said I did not know <pb n="750" xml:id="pg_750" facs="0778"/>what the thinking about timing was but I felt sure that
       we would, in due course, proceed with the ratification of the agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador also raised the question of missile talks. I referred to reports of Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s discussions in Moscow. I said
       that again I was not aware what decisions, if any, might have been taken here. I agreed when
       the Ambassador remarked that the ball was in our court, and said I assumed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> had discussed this with President Johnson, but did not
       know what had transpired.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked for my personal advice on
       what he or his Embassy should do with respect to the President–Elect. He
       understood that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> would probably remain in New
       York until the inauguration and that it was unlikely that he would have an occasion to see
       him. He wondered whether he should try to get in touch with any of the people around Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>. He thought the matter was somewhat delicate as
       he did not wish in any way to appear to be pushing or to forget the fact that President
       Johnson would be in office until January 20.</p>
                        <p>I suggested that he would probably be well advised to take no initiative in the matter, but
       to be available if any of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s
       advisers should approach him.<note n="2" xml:id="d316fn2">See <ref target="#d334fn1">footnote

                        </p>
                        <p>I asked what his views were on a possible summit meeting between Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and the Soviet leaders.</p>
                        <pb n="751" xml:id="pg_751" facs="0779"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador replied that his personal view was that he was very much in favor of a
       summit meeting and thought that the sooner it took place, the better, although Moscow would
       realize that this was a matter involving <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> domestic
       considerations. He thought the Soviet leaders would be quite prepared to meet Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> either before or after the inauguration.<note n="3" xml:id="d316fn3">In telegram 6642 from Moscow, November 29, <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> reported this conversation to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and indicated that in a November 19 letter he had passed on the

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s agenda for lunch<note n="2" xml:id="d317fn2">Reference is to Rostow's lunch meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on November 14.</note> was quite clear:</p>
                        <p>—Vietnam;</p>
                        <p>—missile talks.</p>
                        <p>1. With respect to Vietnam, he was primarily interested in knowing how we were getting on
       with Saigon. I explained some of Saigon's difficulties, emphasizing the role of
       Hanoi, VC, and Paris propaganda. I hit hard on the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and
       firing upon our reconnaissance planes.<note n="3" xml:id="d317fn3">See special memo on
        reconnaissance. [Handwritten footnote in the source text. The memorandum is scheduled for
        publication in <ref target="frus1964-68v07">

       told him I was temperately optimistic about the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> getting
       to Paris, but could give him no time.</p>
                        <p>He said he hoped it could be soon. We were losing momentum. He expressed the hope that when
       they got to Paris they would be able to organize private talks in various pairings.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Saigon and the NLF, he said that they would not come hat in hand to
        <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName> begging forgiveness but would negotiate hard
       on the basis of the population and territory they held, plus their program for the future of
       the country.</p>
                        <pb n="752" xml:id="pg_752" facs="0780"/>
                        <p>I said the critical matter, in my view, for Saigon and the NLF was to get off together up a
       back street in Paris and talk about the substance of the matter rather than jockeying
       publicly for face and position. He agreed.</p>
                        <p>His final remark of the lunch was as follows: “Off the record, I wish to tell
       you that we have had as much trouble with Hanoi as you are having with Saigon. The only
       difference is that your troubles take place in public.”</p>
                        <p>2. Missile talks. I told him that there might be advantages in opening the missile talks
       soon; but two things would be required if the President could have a strong case:</p>
                        <p>—an atmosphere that made such talks politically possible;</p>
                        <p>—clarity about the result.</p>
                        <p>He picked this up with the confidence of a man who had full instructions.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that his government felt that it was
       important not to lose momentum in the missile talks, and it was equally important that we
       create a good atmosphere for the passage of the Non–Proliferation Treaty. He felt
       that it would be a great contribution to the future of U.S.–Soviet relations if
       President Johnson could get these talks started very soon, because it would lay a basis for
       moving rapidly with the next Administration.</p>
                        <p>He then turned very professionally to:</p>
                        <p>—What are the conditions?</p>
                        <p>—What do you want by way of an outcome?</p>
                        <p>With respect to conditions, I pointed out that the effort had been frustrated by their move
       into Czechoslovakia. The critical thing for us to know is that there was a clear dated plan
       for the movement of Soviet troops out of Czechoslovakia.</p>
                        <p>He asked: Does that mean all troops? If it does, you should know that some troops will
       remain.</p>
                        <p>I said that I could not talk for the President in this matter, but my impression was that
       the troop withdrawal issue had to be clear and Czechoslovakia, in general, quiet. He said he
       would try to get for me information on the timing of the troop withdrawal schedule, although
       he added that he thought our intelligence people were probably well informed.</p>
                        <p>I then said that it was a fact of life that trouble in Berlin would not create a proper
       atmosphere for moving forward. He said that the Soviet Union did not wish trouble in Berlin.
       It was Moscow's impression, however, that Bonn was playing a game of mounting more
       and more meetings in Berlin as a provocation. Bonn rather hoped that there <pb n="753" xml:id="pg_753" facs="0781"/>would be trouble, and this would serve as an excuse for
       postponing the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and obstructing U.S.–Soviet
       relations. He first said that Bonn was creating “new precedents” in the
       meetings it mounted in Berlin. When I challenged him on this, he shifted to: They are pushing
       too many meetings in Berlin in too short a period of time. I said I would check this, but
       that was not my impression. He ended by saying he would report our feeling about Berlin as an
       environmental condition.</p>
                        <p>He then turned to the proposed result of the meeting. He said he had assumed from our
       previous conversations that a meeting would:</p>
                        <p>—exchange technical papers and explain them;</p>
                        <p>—leave detailed negotiation for a later time; and</p>
                        <p>—issue an agreed set of guiding principles.</p>
                        <p>He then put this question: Are the principles which I transmitted to you from the Chairman
       (attached at Tab A) satisfactory?<note n="4" xml:id="d317fn4">
                                <ref target="#d308">Document 308</ref>.</note> Are there any clarifications that you wish in
       those principles? Is there anything you would like to add? He said that his government would,
       in his view, be glad to exchange views at the Ambassadorial level, via Tommy <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> in Moscow, or elsewhere, so that President Johnson
       could have in hand the concrete result he wanted before proceeding to a final decision on a
       Summit Meeting on missiles. He was sure that his government would negotiate in good faith to
       try to achieve this result.</p>
                        <p>I said that I could not tell him whether the President would regard as a sufficient end
       result a meeting of the kind he described ending up with the publication of the principles as
       he had transmitted them to us. I told him I would be in touch with the President and let him
       know.</p>
                        <p>As we left, he pressed this point hard and asked when I could be back to him with an answer
       to this question. I said that I could give him no time. It was possible that the President
       would wish to consult Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, who is out of the
        country.<note n="5" xml:id="d317fn5">
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> was attending the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial Meeting in Brussels.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>He ended the discussion by saying he was sure his government was prepared to move fast on
       missile talks. He would inform them of the two conditions I had raised concerning the
       environment for such talks. He urged us to let him know if the “concrete
       result” we wish to have in hand was satisfactory and, if not satisfactory, how we
       would wish it changed.</p>
                        <p>3. We then exchanged views on the Middle East. He thought we should both work to try to get
        <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> to lay on the table a proposal which had the
       backing of the U.S. and the Soviet Union. He said that he had transmitted his conversation
       with E.V. Rostow to Moscow and <pb n="754" xml:id="pg_754" facs="0782"/>hoped for an early
       response. I asked him whether he thought Cairo was ready for peace. He said: Yes, if it did
       not involve a public acknowledgment of defeat. I asked if that included letting the Israeli
       ships go through the canal. He said that he thought that Cairo was unhinging the link between
       Israeli shipping and the refugee problem; but it would probably try to keep the Israeli ships
       as a “late item” in the settlement.</p>
                        <p>4. General Observations. We exchanged reflections on the last eight years. He said he
       thought this had been a period of “missed opportunities” in which the
       fault lay on both sides. Nevertheless, we had made some progress. It would be a great thing
       if we were to set the missile talks in motion soon and lay a framework for continuity into
       the next Administration while accelerating the passage of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>Herewith an initial comment on <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s
       position at the lunch he initiated.</p>
                        <p>1. Moscow is clearly ready to go—and eager—if you can work it
       out.</p>
                        <p>2. Their reasons are quite similar to our own: to create a good backdrop for the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> in January; to keep the momentum of the work on missiles going
       into the next Administration; and, therefore, to avoid a long delay in both the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and the missile affairs.<note n="2" xml:id="d318fn2">For <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s analysis of Soviet reasons for favoring an early
        start to missile talks, see <ref target="frus1964-68v11#d296">

        296</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. Reading over the proposed joint communiqué statement on the missile
        talks,<note n="3" xml:id="d318fn3">Presumably a reference to the principles proposed by the
        Soviet Government in <ref target="#d308">Document 308</ref>.</note> I have two
       reflections:</p>
                        <p>—first, they need some staffing out by Sect. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and a few others;</p>
                        <pb n="755" xml:id="pg_755" facs="0783"/>
                        <p>—basically, they represent the kind of public commitment that might emerge;
       although the heart of the matter will lie not in the public statement of principles, but
       rather in the simple fact that initial positions have been exchanged between the two
       governments and that further rational negotiation can proceed early in the next
       Administration.</p>
                        <p>4. The heart of the matter, then, is not so much in the refinement of the principles, but
       in persuading <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> that this is the right course for
       him, for the President, and for the nation.</p>
                        <p>5. With respect to a rationale for <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, these are
       key points:</p>
                        <p>—we have been working on this since January 1964, and working intensively since
       the Glassboro sessions;</p>
                        <p>—we start with a position which is fully acceptable to the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and all civilian authorities in the government;</p>
                        <p>—any modifications and negotiations from that position will lie in the hands of
       the next Administration;</p>
                        <p>—a coming to grips with this matter at an early date would make it easier to get
       the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> through the Senate in January;</p>
                        <p>—equally important, if <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> encourages
       the President to go forward with this, it will virtually guarantee Soviet restraint on Berlin
       and Eastern Europe in the first phase of his Administration because once the talks are
       started, the Soviet Union will have a major interest in not creating circumstances which
       would require that they be broken off. We have been clear with them about both Berlin and
       Czechoslovakia.</p>
                        <p>6. I have no doubt that there will be those who argue to <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> that he should wait and take this matter in hand himself. I understand
       very well the leverage we had on him on the Vietnam matter; but I am not clear what leverage
       the President will have on this issue except:</p>
                        <p>—his power of initiative even without <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s assent;</p>
                        <p>—an appeal to statesmanship and self–interest.</p>

                        <p>Moscow is making a determined effort to restore a business–as–usual
       atmosphere to its relations with the West. The Soviet aim is to implant the notion that
       Soviet domination of Eastern Europe—on which Moscow has been insisting
       vehemently—is one thing, while “détente” is
       another. To this end, the Soviets have toned down their propaganda attacks on the West, have
       made a number of conciliatory gestures on particular issues, and have tried to revive
       interest in questions of mutual East–West concern.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has publicly and privately made clear that it is
       willing to begin exploratory talks with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> on limitation
       of strategic weapons. At a Soviet anniversary reception in London last week, for example, a
       Russian diplomat urged that the US get on with arms discussions. In the main address at the
       celebration of the Bolshevik Revolution in Moscow on 7 November, First Deputy Premier Mazurov
       reiterated Russia's readiness to do so, as did the Soviet ambassador at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in a major speech on disarmament this week. Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was apparently eager to convey the same message to
       former Defense Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> in Moscow this
        week.<note n="2" xml:id="d319fn2">See <ref target="#d314">Document 314</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Russians also have moved recently to conclude some minor agreements with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> on which both sides had been marking time, including a
       long–planned exchange of new embassy sites. The purpose of these actions clearly
       was to hasten the end of the period of coolness in Soviet–American relations which
       set in with the invasion of Czechoslovakia. In addition, the Soviets and their East German
       allies refrained from retaliatory moves during a fortnight of West German meetings in Berlin,
       although Moscow may yet give East Germany the green light to impose new restrictions on West
       German access to Berlin. It seems clear, however, that the Soviets wish to avoid the kind of
       harassment that could lead to a Soviet–Allied confrontation.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets recently took pains to receive amiably the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>'s new ambassador in Moscow. President <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName> contended that Anglo–<pb n="757" xml:id="pg_757" facs="0785"/>Soviet relations had suffered “unnecessarily” as a result of the
       Czechoslovak affair. Moscow's diplomatic efforts have resulted in the rescheduling
       for this winter of a session of the Franco–Soviet “Grande
       Commission” on cooperative projects, which was due to meet in September but had
       been postponed by Paris. The Soviets have studiously avoided including France in their press
       attacks on the “imperialist” West since the Czechoslovak invasion in
       order to maintain at least the appearance of a special
       “détente” with Paris. Recently, some of the venom has been
       dropped from Soviet propaganda directed at West Germany, a favorite target. Indeed, Moscow
       has made the gesture of offering to reopen negotiations with Bonn on a civil air agreement.
       Moreover, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has generally muted its
       anti–Western propaganda, and for several weeks has ceased to accuse the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> of having incited Czechoslovak
       “reactionaries.”</p>
                        <p>Other efforts to improve the Soviet image can be found in the succession of
       high–level foreign visitors welcomed in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.
       Since the invasion, ranking officials from all of the non–Communist countries on
       Russia's borders except Turkey and Norway have received the red carpet
       treatment.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>You asked me to develop a plan to get the missile talks started at the highest level.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Problems</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>—Czechoslovakia.</p>
                        <p>The military situation is that the Soviets appear to be down to three divisions plus some
       headquarters troops. That is probably rock bottom. They have pulled their forces away from
       the German frontier and are not, therefore, in a tactically threatening position with respect
       to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. My judgment about Soviet troops is that we have
       that issue in <pb n="758" xml:id="pg_758" facs="0786"/>about as good shape as we can get it.
       It should not be a barrier to strategic missile talks.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Czech politics, the situation is less clear. Obviously, Czech liberals and
       Soviet–backed conservatives are still struggling with the conservatives, making
       progress, but not winning. The students and the unions seem to have made effective common
       cause. I would say that unless we get demonstrations and strikes with bloody repression, we
       could probably live with the Czech domestic political situation.</p>
                        <p>—In making the case to our people for going ahead with strategic missile talks,
       however, we would have to acknowledge that the whole intervention was tragic. We could not
       gloss it over. We could say something that is true: It is in the interest of the Czechs as
       well as all humanity that we proceed with the strategic missile talks.</p>
                        <p>—Berlin.</p>
                        <p>Recent alarums proved false. My guess is that Berlin would be quiet if we went ahead.</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">The text of the Joint Communiqué on Missiles.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I re–read what the Soviets added. One of their paragraphs talks about
       “equal security should be assured for both sides.” If this is
       interpreted to mean that each side should be left with an assured second strike capability,
       we could buy it. We would have to make sure, however, that the Soviets did not read this as
       meaning that we were going for equal numbers in all categories. This we could not buy.</p>
                        <p>—More generally, I think we would have to come back to the Soviets with our own
       redraft of the present combination of their points and our points before we could be
       confident that the result would be acceptable. Bob <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> could work with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> on
       this once the President and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> had agreed in
       principle that we should go forward.</p>
                        <p>—The major problem is <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and his
       willingness either to support an early meeting on missiles at the highest level, or not to
       oppose it. I repeat the paragraph from my previous memo:<note n="2" xml:id="d320fn2">
                                <ref target="#d318">Document 318</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>“With respect to a rationale for <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>,
       these are key points:</p>
                        <p>—we have been working on this since January 1964, and working intensively since
       the Glassboro sessions;</p>
                        <p>—we start with a position which is fully acceptable to the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and all civilian authorities in the government;</p>
                        <p>—any modifications and negotiations from that position will lie in the hands of
       the next Administration;</p>
                        <p>—a coming to grips with this matter at an early date would make it easier to get
       the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> through the Senate in January;</p>
                        <pb n="759" xml:id="pg_759" facs="0787"/>
                        <p>—equally important, if <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> encourages

       would require that they be broken off. We have been clear with them about both Berlin and
       Czechoslovakia.”</p>
                        <p>2. In retrospect, I think that last point could be made very strongly to him. In general,
       my somewhat amateur political advice would be this:</p>
                        <p>—Tell <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> you have decided to go ahead
       if you can get agreement along the lines of the principles already built into the U.S.
       national position;</p>
                        <p>—Give him the option of coming along, like Attlee with Churchill to Potsdam;</p>
                        <p>—Give him the option also of having <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> come along;</p>
                        <p>—Before seeing <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, however, make sure
       we have an agreed redraft of the principles we would put to Moscow cleared by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. That is the first preliminary technical job. I would suggest
       that Sect. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> be asked by you to take it in hand
       promptly.</p>
                        <p>3. Your case for doing it before January is exceedingly strong because:</p>
                        <p>—You have put almost five years' work into it, including intensive
       work in the last year and a half;</p>
                        <p>—The opening of these talks could ease the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>
       problem enormously.</p>

        conversation at this meeting was reported in <ref target="#d325">Document 325</ref>.</note>
       Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> raised the following points with
       the Secretary: (1) the status of the repatriation treaty for astronauts; (2) the discussion
       with the Soviets of territorial waters; (3) the American reaction to the latest Soviet offer
       in regard to the Embassy plots; (4) the question of the peaceful uses of atomic energy; and
       finally, (5) the status of the <persName corresp="#p_IIA1">Ivanov</persName> case. The
       Secretary asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> to check on these points
       but said in regard to the <persName corresp="#p_IIA1">Ivanov</persName> case that this would
       have to wait the disposition of the case before the Supreme Court.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> checked on the above matters and found
       out: (1) The dates of either the 3rd, 5th or 10th of December had been suggested to the White
       House for signature of the repatriation treaty for astronauts, but no reply had been received
       from the White House.<note n="3" xml:id="d321fn3">The Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts,
        the Return of Astronauts, and the Return of Objects Launched Into Outer Space entered into
        force on December 3 with the deposit in Washington, London, and Moscow of instruments of
        ratification by the three depository governments. A separate rather than a joint deposit
        procedure was followed. The State Department favored the former “in keeping with
        our post–Czech invasion attitude toward the Soviets,” according to a
        November 22 memorandum from Rostow to the President. (Johnson Library, National Security
        File, Country File, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, Vol. XXII)</note> (2) Territorial
       waters—we are prepared to go ahead and <persName corresp="#p_MLC1">Meeker</persName> was supposed to discuss with Vorontsov. (3) Embassy plots—we
       have decided to accept the Soviet proposition and the Embassy has been suitably informed.
       There is here a problem of hearings under District law before the Washington plot can be
       transferred to the Soviets. (4) Peaceful uses—it was ascertained that this had
       been placed on ice for the time being.</p>

       1968</date>.</dateline>
                        <p>In general, I have concluded that in these nuclear matters I must take clear
       responsibility, but to do so in ways which keep flexibility for you after January 20. I
       understand that it is difficult for you to make responsible judgments at this time. You
       deserve time to assemble the advisers you want and to turn around and form your own
       assessments as to where you wish to go in the months and years ahead.</p>
                        <p>Briefly, the situation is this.</p>
                        <p>First, as you know, we have been working towards these discussions of strategic missiles
       since the London talks which Stassen began in 1958 on behalf of President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>. I myself went to work on this in January 1964 in my
       first communication with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. At Glassboro I
       spent the better part of two days trying to get a date set to open these talks. We were just
       about to open them when the Soviets moved into Czechoslovakia in August.</p>
                        <p>Second, the Soviets indicated to us about two weeks ago, on November 14, that they felt it
       important to move promptly because they felt we were losing ground around the world on the
       Non-Proliferation Treaty. I share that judgment. I think the clock is ticking against you as
       well as against me on this non-proliferation issue. And I have concluded that we must move on
       the missile talks, if we can, to create an environment in the world which will make it easier
       for Japan, Germany, Israel, and India to put the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> through
       their parliaments.</p>
                        <p>Third, twice in the last two weeks Dobrynin has told us that the Soviets are willing to
       negotiate with us in advance what we would agree to say as a result of the first exchange of
       positions on the missile matter. You should know that we have a position wholly agreed from
       Bill Foster to Bus Wheeler, from the Arms Control people to the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. You should also know that we would not move off that position before January
       20. Therefore, any further negotiations of the missile matter would be in your hands. I am in
       a position, therefore, to go into this with a very limited objective. My objective would
       be:</p>
                        <p>—To put into negotiation our agreed position;</p>
                        <p>—To receive their initial position;</p>
                        <pb n="762" xml:id="pg_762" facs="0790"/>
                        <p>—To enunciate certain general propositions which are consistent with our
       position;</p>
                        <p>—To leave subsequent negotiations to the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration;</p>
                        <p>—In the meanwhile, to use the occasion to press Moscow to push forward Hanoi in
       the Paris talks, and to press <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> on one critical
       point in the Middle East; namely, the need for the Egyptians to sign on to a document which
       would end belligerence and open the way to peace. This is the sticking point with the
       Israelis, and properly so.</p>
                        <p>Fourth, you should know that in discussions with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, we have made it very clear that the missile talks could not take place
       if there were any trouble in Berlin and any further moves in Eastern Europe. So far as
       Czechoslovakia is concerned, they have withdrawn all their forces except 3 divisions and a
       headquarters; that is, they have 30 to 40,000 men instead of a quarter of a million.
       Moreover, these troops are no longer near the Bavarian border, they are near Prague. If we
       start these talks, I believe we will have a basis for Soviet good behavior in Europe which
       will stretch into the first months of your administration. Remembering the confusion you
       observed as Vice President in early 1953 when Stalin died, and I observed in early 1961 when
       we had the Bay of Pigs and a Berlin ultimatum, I would like you to have the chance of as
       quiet a period as possible as you get your administration on the road.</p>
                        <p>These are the four reasons which have determined my judgment that I should proceed. All
       that I ask of you is to reserve judgment until you see the results of these talks with the
       Russians. I think it would be wise if Bob Murphy came along as an observer. In this matter,
       you could play it as you think best for the future. If it goes well, you can back it up and
       stay with it. If it goes poorly, you would be able to retain your total freedom of action
       because, as I say, we would only be putting into play an existing agreed position wholly safe
       so far as U.S. interests are concerned.</p>
                        <p>This is what I have decided; but I want Bob Murphy to give you in depth all the
       considerations which have led me to this conclusion. You can then let me know exactly how you
       wish to position yourself in terms of your own interests and the future.<note n="2" xml:id="d322fn2">In a November 29 memorandum to the President, Rostow reported that he had
        just talked with <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> by phone and that <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said: “On going to the meeting,
        ‘Frankly, he is blowing hot and cold.’ He will want to turn it around
        in his mind. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> will let me
        know—probably by the end of the day.” In a December 2 memorandum to
        the President, Rostow reported:“Bob Murphy called this morning and said Mr.
         <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> had decided: it would be best if he did not
        attend a Summit conference now; Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> would be
        his observer.” (Both ibid.)</note>

                        <p>In Paris, we worked out an arrangement with Hanoi where we agreed to disagree. It was a
       “Your side, our side” arrangement. On October 28 we had agreed language
       with <persName corresp="#p_Thieu1">Thieu</persName> to announce this, but when the horse came
       to the hurdle he would not jump.</p>
                        <p>There will be a good deal of confusion.</p>
                        <p>They are shooting at our reconnaissance planes and there have been violations of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>.</p>

       talk. <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> is working on this.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets have replaced all lost arms.</p>
                        <p>The Israeli Cabinet is split over terms of settlement. Eshkol is fighting for his political
       life.</p>

                        <p>Non-nuclear countries are building up resistance to the treaty because of our delay in
       approving it. Some of the non-nuclear countries want firm guarantees against aggression. We
       can't do that. That literally would make us policemen of the world.</p>
                        <p>Germany would not approve it without our doing so. We expect Italy to sign.</p>
                        <pb n="764" xml:id="pg_764" facs="0792"/>
                        <p>We are concerned about what is going on in Israel. We want some satisfaction for Israel on
       this. If they are 5-months pregnant, it may not be too late to stop it.</p>
                        <p>Japan will probably sign it.</p>
                        <p>Brazil, Argentina and Chile haven't signed it.</p>
                        <p>We have the same problem with India and Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>It could be dangerous in the months ahead.</p>
                        <p>At the moment when the Soviets moved into Czechoslovakia we were about to announce talks
       with them on the following:</p>
                        <p>1. Strategic Missiles</p>
                        <p>2. Mideast</p>
                        <p>3. Vietnam</p>
                        <p>Soviets have come to realize same thing as <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
       about the strategic arms race. We would hope to announce some principles with Soviets to get
       it moving toward a peaceful settlement. In Southeast Asia, we are in a position to demand a
       lot from the Soviets. We did what they asked us to do—stop the bombing of a fellow
       Socialist Republic.</p>
                        <p>We think it would be good for the President and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> to meet.</p>
                        <p>We want to know about the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> coming back.</p>
                        <p>1. Would a new committee hearing be needed?</p>
                        <p>2. What kind of vote would you expect?</p>
                        <p>3. How much of Czechoslovakia still hangs over it?</p>
                        <p>4. What about talks with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. Should we try to
       get forward movement started?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM1">Clifford</persName>: We wish to maintain close
       working arrangements with South Vietnam. We must keep up reconnaissance to protect our men.
       We must know if they are moving substantial number of troops and supplies north of the DMZ.
       Some black Monday they might pour over the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and kill many
       of our men.</p>
                        <p>We have stopped bombing for 26 days—now it is time for them to produce.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> is having problems with cost of increased
       missile force.</p>
                        <p>They have start of an anti-ballistic missile system.</p>
                        <p>In <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> we are ready to discuss the elimination of a
       defensive missile system or a small defensive missile system to protect both of us from
       China.</p>
                        <p>We have every member of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> behind this plan now. We
       will lose two men on the JCS next spring—<persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> and McConnell.<note n="2" xml:id="d323fn2">General John P. McConnell,
        Chief of Staff, Air Force.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>If we wait for <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> they will put off those matters
       they can put off.</p>
                        <pb n="765" xml:id="pg_765" facs="0793"/>
                        <p>It could be a year before a <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> team is ready to
       do this.</p>
                        <p>If we get the talks started he will only have to continue it. We need the impetus of a
       start.</p>
                        <p>If talks were held in Geneva it could be valuable.</p>
                        <p>The two men might also talk about Korea. They have been exceedingly provocative. As of now,
       we do have some superiority in nuclear field. They would like to stop now, I believe.</p>
                        <p>If a freeze were to take place, <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> would like for it to
       stop now. It would give us a slight advantage. If the Soviets have other adventures in mind
       this meeting could be a deterrent in this regard.</p>
                        <p>We have just been through a serious monetary crisis. What we are concerned with is the
       solidity of the dollar.</p>
                        <p>We have a momentum going now. It started with the decision to stop the bombing. Now we will
       have Paris talks.</p>
                        <p>If we could get talks with the Soviets, there is a momentum toward peace.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>: I told <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> the President wanted to know if he would support a special session of the
       Senate. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> talked to <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>. On Sunday, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> said he wanted to
       talk to the leadership.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> said the President had to make a decision. He
       was not able to form an independent judgment. He (<persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>) said he was a strong supporter of the treaty, but some members would
       resent coming back for a special session. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> gave

                        <p>The President: Senator <persName corresp="#p_RRB1">Russell</persName> said he had to have
       more assurance than he has now before he would support it.</p>
                        <p>I do not like to see us wait. I do not know of anybody who would be hostile.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_FW1">Fulbright</persName>: There are five vacancies on my
       Committee. I would like to get it back to 15.</p>
                        <p>The key man is Dick Russell.</p>
                        <p>I didn't ask <persName corresp="#p_RRB1">Russell</persName>. If Russell would
       support it and Stennis would support it you would have.</p>
                        <p>My first reaction is to do it by the first of December—not around Christmas. It
       would be no great problem if you call them back. We could have a briefing
       hearing—jointly with Armed Services and Foreign Relations.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_RRB1">Russell</persName> is the key man.</p>

                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_FW1">Fulbright</persName>: It would be an excellent beginning
       for talks. It would be an excellent introduction for talks if this succeeded. I am very much
       in favor of talks and in favor of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: If we brought this up and it failed

                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_FW1">Fulbright</persName>: I would question him. I would try
       talks with Soviets even if you do not have special session. I would do it at
       Geneva—not at Moscow.</p>
                        <p>I think the Soviets went into Czechoslovakia because they thought they were losing

                        <p>The President: I talked about the possibility of meeting with the Soviets with Senator
        <persName corresp="#p_FW1">Fulbright</persName> and Bob Murphy, liaison with <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM1">Clifford</persName>: I said we had meeting after
       meeting after Glassboro on missile talks. I think it was the best prepared effort I had seen.
       At the eleventh hour, they (Soviets) went into Czechoslovakia.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets can't see how they can face the costs of the missile race.</p>
                        <p>They are ready for talks. We are ready. There is support for this at Defense. When
        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> comes in, it could be a year before you get
       back to the point where we are now.</p>
                        <p>We now have substantial nuclear superiority over the Soviets. If a freeze goes into effect,
       we would be ahead. They are gaining in <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> and submarine
       field.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Robert Murphy</persName>: I don't know if we have
       superiority or not, based on intelligence briefings and reports I have had. We need to cut
       down on expenses. We have something going. The bombing was stopped. South Vietnam will come
       to Paris.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: An announcement will be made
       tonight.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM1">Clifford</persName>: I think it would be in
       President-Elect <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s interest to get
       these talks started. During his term, I expect an agreement could be reached.</p>
                        <p>A number of forces are in position now to let talks begin. Then technicians can take

                        <p>Vietnam</p>

                        <p>Mideast</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>: The Soviets said they have done full
       staff work. They have a paper to hand us—a bargaining paper.</p>
                        <p>They are prepared to have agreed statement before we go.</p>
                        <p>We would go back and study papers each handed us.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Robert Murphy</persName>: That Communiqué would be a
       great achievement.</p>
                        <p>They use ”equality of security.”</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: We have used this.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>: This is Dobrynin talking to Rusk and
       me.</p>
                        <p>The President has long history of correspondence on Vietnam. We could lay out this. They
       seem to want to work the Mideast out.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: We were far down this track before
       Czechoslovakia.</p>
                        <p>Neither one of us has decisive influence on countries of the Mideast. But we both do have
       legitimate claims on Soviet on Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Robert Murphy</persName>: I have a reservation about summit
       meetings. The thought of another Glassboro would be unappealing.</p>
                        <p>The President: The question of preparation is not a relevant one. We have been
       prepared.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: We are under pressure from
       non-nuclear countries to get going on these talks.</p>
                        <p>The level of talks is related to Vietnam and the Mideast. Every week that goes by without
       progress increases the danger.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Robert Murphy</persName>: On the balance, this should appeal to
       Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President: We don't want to commit Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, we do want him to know of it.</p>
                        <p>Buz, any comment?</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: No, Sir.</p>

                        <p>There follows a memorandum of conversation at luncheon November 25th between myself and
        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> prior to the latter's return to

       I invited <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> to discuss the matter further with
       you in Moscow when he has reactions from his own people. It is most important that you handle

       much on his mind. He sees some considerable advantage if such a meeting could produce forward
       movement on strategic missiles and some improvement both in the Middle East and Southeast
       Asia. We do not underestimate the difficulties or complications. Much, of course, will depend
       upon the attitude of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> as strategic missile
       talks cannot get very far beyond the exploratory stage before January 20th. I would be glad
       to have any reactions you yourself have along the way but, again, I emphasize the importance

                        <p>“The Secretary said that the President was giving renewed thought to the
       possibility of a meeting between himself and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. He thought that it might be a good idea if such a meeting could produce
        <pb n="770" xml:id="pg_770" facs="0798"/>positive results and not merely mean that each side
       would reiterate their positions on a number of questions. He said the meeting could produce
       some progress on important questions and help reduce tensions that would be worthwhile. He
       was not referring merely to what was said in the communiqué of what would be the
       practical effect of a private meeting between the two men.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he thought almost all
       of these matters had been agreed prior to the postponement of the idea of a meeting.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed and added that however at the present time it would be necessary to
       talk this subject over with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>.</p>
                        <p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Secretary mentioned the possibility of some progress on the Middle East. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied that it would be difficult to obtain any
       assurance beforehand although almost any subject could be discussed. The Secretary mentioned
       the Middle East as a possibility. He said for example if there could be a Soviet-American
       agreement that both would use their best influence to bring about a situation where peaceful
       arrangements might be possible between Israel and the Arabs this would be important. The
       Secretary went on to say that he had raised on his own initiative with Riad in New York a
       number of points of possible settlement. He had been disappointed in Riad's
       reaction, who had taken refuge behind Jordan and Syria. He said that the U.S. had put these
       propositions forward without clearing them with Israel and he wished to assure <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that the U.S. was very serious in the Middle East
       matter. In fact, the Israelis had been somewhat upset. He asked Dobrynin to try and ascertain
       whether in the Soviet judgment it would be possible to make any progress in the Middle East
       at a summit meeting. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied that there could
       be no guarantee of result, but that the subjects could be discussed.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then inquired exactly what the
       Secretary would like to receive from the Soviet Union which had not already been mentioned in
       the exchange of letters between Kosygin and the President. The Secretary replied that it was
       not a question of what went into the communiqué but rather a private agreement
       which might be reached between the two men when they met. In the Middle East it would be
       useful if we could agree that we would both use our influence, the Soviet Union with the
       Arabs and the U.S. with the Israelis. He mentioned the seven points that he had put to Riad
       and inquired whether or not the Soviet Union really thought that these seven points had merit
       and could constitute a possible basis.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> inquired whether or not the
       President was thinking of a meeting in general or whether he really wanted to have answers to
       specific points before he could consent to a meeting. The <pb n="771" xml:id="pg_771" facs="0799"/>Secretary replied that at the moment it was not specific as to points but more
       thinking aloud. The Secretary again referred to the seven points that he had put to Riad and
       stated that it might be useful to have the Soviet opinion as to whether these might form a
       basis to a settlement between Israel and the Arabs. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> remarked that there might be more points added or some changes might be
       made, but that anything could be discussed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said the President would like to know whether or not it was considered on the
       Soviet side that a meeting would be worthwhile in the present circumstances. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he was sure that his government would agree
       that the Middle East should be on the agenda. He did not think that he could get any opinion
       as to results in advance of the event. He repeated his question as to whether or not the
       President was merely thinking of the idea of a meeting or wanted assurances on a number of
       points before it was decided. The Secretary repeated that the President was thinking in broad
       terms and not about details. The Secretary said for reasons with which the Ambassador was
       familiar the meeting had to be postponed, but the President was thinking about the
       possibility and whether or not it would be worthwhile or would merely result in a reiteration
       of previous positions. The Secretary mentioned for example that we might both agree to use
       influence to reduce incidents. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
       returned to his previous question as to whether the President was asking for assurance before
       agreeing to a meeting or was merely thinking out loud. The Secretary said that if it was
       understood for example that both wanted peace in the Middle East and used influence to that
       end this would produce a result which would be very useful. He mentioned the difference
       between speeches in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and that of conversations which
       would occur at a meeting. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> remarked that he
       could agree right here and now that the Soviet Union wished peace in the Middle East and he
       did not believe that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> would have any problem in
       talking about using their influence to that end, but repeated that it was difficult to make
       pre-conditions in advance. He said he knew that on his return to Moscow he would have an
       interview with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, who would ask concretely and
       specifically ‘What do the Americans want from us?’ The Secretary said
       he was not asking for any conditions.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> remarked that he thought in
       regard to the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> matter that this whole thing had been
       agreed in principle and there would be no need to redefine the question. The Secretary said
       that he agreed as far as the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> was concerned, but he
       thought that what was involved was a judgment by both of them as to whether or not at this
       particular time a meeting would be useful. If both were prepared to use their full weight
       with the respective friends in the Middle <pb n="772" xml:id="pg_772" facs="0800"/>East this
       in itself would be useful. He repeated that he had gone ahead without Israel in his
       discussion with Riad and that had been quite upsetting, and he wondered whether the Soviet
       Union would be prepared to do the same thing in regard to the Egyptians. Dobrynin repeated
       the quest as to what the American Government wanted from the Soviet Government.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Southeast Asia</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Secretary said in stopping the bombing in Vietnam we had really agreed to the primary
       Soviet desire in regard to the Southeast Asia matter and he pointed out the 230 violations in
       the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> since the cessation of bombing. He said there was
       evidence of enemy personnel, not Viet Cong but North Vietnamese, while we had absolutely no
       personnel in the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>. He said it would be useful to consider
       whether or not it might be useful to consider some of the understandings reached with Hanoi
       being put into a formal or more contractual form. It was possible that the British and the
       Soviets as co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference might wish to consider the desirability of
       putting the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> into the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>,
       or another possibility would be for Hanoi to agree to get its people out of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>. He thought this might be a suitable subject for discussion
       between the President and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. A second point
       which might be suitable was the 1962 agreements on Laos. In 1962 after the negotiations an
       agreement had been worked out and we felt that the considerations which were offered then
       were still relevant in the situation at the present time. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> remarked that the history of Vietnam was a very
       complicated and long one; that it was doubtful if we could take two subjects such as the
        <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and Laos in isolation from others. The Secretary said
       that when we had doubts as to the clarity of Hanoi's understanding we had
       discussed it with the Ambassador who had brought back the reply that the Soviet Government
       said the doubts were unfounded.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that for a long time it had been a first requirement of the Soviet Union
       that the U.S. should stop the bombing. This was now done and ‘we want to know what
       it means to you.’ <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> reverted to his
       original thesis that it was possible to discuss anything; that there could be no assurances
       or pre-conditions before a meeting. The Secretary replied that he was not trying to lay down
       conditions but was groping for a judgment on both sides as to whether or not the meeting
       would be worthwhile in that it would move things along positively and reduce tensions.
        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he thought on two subjects, the
        <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> and the Middle East, there would not be so many
       problems, but that on the last two mentioned, the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and
       Laos, this would be difficult. He pointed out as he had said earlier that the Vietnam
       situation was complicated and had a long history, and you couldn't treat two
       questions in isolation.</p>
                        <pb n="773" xml:id="pg_773" facs="0801"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said we had stopped the bombing and this greatly simplified the situation.
        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> remarked that the Soviet Union had been
       helpful in arranging the talks in Paris. The Secretary said when he had asked <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> some time in the past whether or not after the bombing
       was stopped they would be in favor of full implementation of the 1962 Geneva Convention he,
        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, had said yes. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said this was quite true, that he felt to be quite frank for example in
       regard to assurances regarding the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> question required by
       the American side it would be necessary for the Soviet Union to take it up with Hanoi which
       then might consider that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was trying to use the
       subject to get into a meeting with the President. Then they would immediately interpret
       American desire for assurance as a condition. The Secretary said that the fact of 230
       violations of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> was not a very good development. The
       Secretary said he thought the discussion between heads of state would be intimate and
       discreet and indeed very secret, and there might be discussions as to what the two countries,
       the U.S. and the Soviet Union, would do about the situation even in the absence of Hanoi and
       Saigon, for example. He mentioned that President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had met with Khrushchev in Vienna and they had reached a certain type of
       understanding in regard to Laos which had provided help to us in the Geneva Agreement in
       1962. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he understood the importance of
       this but felt there could not be assurances or pre-conditions. At this point the Ambassador
       inquired about what time we had in mind for a summit meeting in our eyes if and when one was
       decided on. The Secretary said possibly some time around the middle of December. The
       Ambassador then said what about an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> meeting if there is no
       summit. The Secretary said he could not comment on this because the present discussion had to
       do with a meeting.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that some time ago he had
       had a discussion with <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName> of the White House
       which had indicated to him that the idea of a summit meeting had been dropped and that he,
       Rostow, inquired about the possibility of <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> discussions
       presented as a separate matter. Rostow at that time referred to Berlin, about which nothing
       had happened. It would appear now that the possibility of a summit was being revived. The
       Secretary agreed and said the President was returning, and he emphasized the word returning,
       to the idea of the possibility of a summit conference.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then asked the Secretary what sort of an idea we had for the solution of the
       Vietnamese question and whether or not we were thinking in terms of a coalition government.
       The Secretary replied that we were not thinking in terms of a coalition government and then
       mentioned that one possibility towards a solution would be the withdrawal of all foreign
       forces, including North Vietnam. This, however, would require the reconciliation of the
       population of South Vietnam. <pb n="774" xml:id="pg_774" facs="0802"/>The Ambassador inquired
       whether this envisaged setting up of an international commission. The Secretary replied that
       it was too far in the future to consider now. He said in reply to the Ambassador's
       question about a cease-fire that one of the difficulties was the actual position of military
       forces inside the country. He pointed out that some of the provincial capitals had to be
       supplied by air and that this problem of access had to be resolved before there could be any
       cease-fire.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary suggested to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that,
       upon his return to Moscow, he ascertain what Soviet leaders feel they can say about the
       questions raised by the Secretary and that he be in touch with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> who will be in a position to handle the matter most
       discreetly.</p>
                        <p>The meeting ended with the Secretary wishing Dobrynin a pleasant voyage and a possible
       holiday in the Soviet Union.”</p>

                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> called me to the Foreign Office at 11:30
       this morning and made following oral statement:</p>
                        <p>“Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> in a conversation
       with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> Ambassador in Washington <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on November 25 of this year<note n="2" xml:id="d326fn2">
                                <ref target="#d325">See Document 325</ref>.</note> touched on a number of questions which,
       in the opinion of President Johnson, could be discussed in the event of his meeting with
       Soviet leaders.</p>
                        <p>In conformity with the desire expressed by <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> to
       learn the opinion of the Soviet side with respect to these questions, we would like to report
       the following for transmission to President Johnson:</p>
                        <p>1. We proceed from the fact that, concerning the limitation of the strategic arms race,
       there was agreement, in the course of the preceding exchange of opinions between us, on a
       sufficient number of concrete propositions regarding common goals and basic principles for
        <pb n="775" xml:id="pg_775" facs="0803"/>limiting and subsequently reducing strategic
       weapons, the approval of which could be completed by a discussion of this question at a
       possible meeting. As far as we understand, our detailed considerations on this subject,
       handed to the Secretary of State on October 2 of this year,<note n="3" xml:id="d326fn3">
                                <ref target="#d308">Document 308</ref>.</note> were positively received on the American
       side. For our part we are ready as before to review the stated considerations as a basis for
       the achievement of an initial, principled agreement on this subject.</p>
                        <p>2. The opinion expressed by Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>,
       to the effect that through the joint efforts of the USA and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> toward peace in the Near East, there can be achieved positive results in a
       peaceful settlement of the Near Eastern conflict, fully corresponds to our point of view on
       this subject.</p>
                        <p>From our side we are doing and intend in future to do everything dependent on us in order
       to promote in practice a peaceful political settlement of the Near Eastern problem and to
       strengthen understanding of the necessity for such a settlement in those countries of the
       region whose governments give consideration to our opinion.</p>
                        <p>We have also repeatedly and frankly expressed to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
       representatives, including to President Johnson personally, our opinion that if the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government will maintain an analogous line with Israel, the cause
       of liquidating the consequences of last year's Israeli aggression against the Arab
       states and thus the establishment of peace in the Near East has every chance of success.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, we are by no means inclined to consider that events in this region
       ‘are not amenable to control.’</p>
                        <p>3. We also have no doubt of the usefulness of an exchange of opinions on questions
       concerning Southeast Asia. From our point of view, the main problem of this region today
       remains the stopping of the bloodshed in Vietnam and the achievement there of a political
       settlement on the basis of respect for the legal rights and aspirations of the Vietnamese
       people.</p>
                        <p>As a result of the agreement reached at the Paris negotiations on the cessation by the
        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> of bombing and other military acts against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and on the beginning of political negotiations with the
       participation of representatives of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, NLF, USA and the
       Saigon administration looking toward a peaceful settlement of the Vietnam problem, more
       favorable conditions have in our view been created for movement forward in this direction.
       Moreover, as is well known, it is in no way the fault of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> or its friends that there is a delay in beginning the political talks with the
       participation of the four sides.</p>
                        <pb n="776" xml:id="pg_776" facs="0804"/>
                        <p>In the event the American side has any other additional considerations which it would like
       to express in connection with the consideration of the question of the possible arranging of
       a meeting between President Johnson and the Soviet leaders, we are ready of course to hear
       them and to take such considerations into account before final decision on this
       question.”</p>
                        <p>2. I said that you were sending me the exchange of correspondence on missile talks but I
       had not yet received it. I asked if it was Soviet idea that at possible meeting an agreement
       on principles to guide missile talks would be reached and embodied in some sort of
       declaration or communiqué and that this would then be followed by detailed
       negotiations. He said that was his understanding.</p>
                        <p>3. I referred to your seven points on the Middle East and asked if he thought these could
       furnish the basis of an agreement. He said he did not wish to discuss details but could say
       that the seven points contained some constructive suggestions. He also wished to refer to the
       conversation he had had on this subject with you in New York. He said the trouble was that
       there appeared to be no change on the part of Israel. He said the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> should use its influence to change the Israeli position.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> has not been able to reach Moscow
       because of bad weather here. I therefore told <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
       for his background that I understood we were thinking of December 16 and 17 in Geneva. He
       said he was not in a position to comment.<note n="4" xml:id="d326fn4">In telegram 279345 to
        Moscow, November 28, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> stated:
        “Regarding time and place of meeting referred to in my last Cherokee our thinking
        is approximately December 16–17 in Geneva. You are free to suggest this to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> at first opportunity.” (Johnson Library,

                        <p>5. Indicating I was speaking without instructions I said that a two-day meeting would leave
       little time for any consultation by the principles with their governments and that it seemed
       to me that the more advance preparation the better. He nodded but did not comment.</p>
                        <p>6. You will note statement referred to Soviet leaders in the plural. I will try to find out
       from <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> whom they have in mind.</p>

                        <p>1. While appreciate President's desire to advance cause of peace before leaving
       office, I confess I am skeptical that much can be achieved at proposed meeting except
       announcement of agreement on principles to guide missile talks which I gather is already well
       prepared.</p>
                        <p>2. Progress is possible on Middle East if we are prepared to make deal which we would both
       agree to try to impose (short of use of force) on the two sides. But I wonder how much
       leverage we will have on Israel with only little over a month remaining from time of talks
       until new administration takes over.</p>
                        <p>3. Highly publicized top level meeting may make Soviet pressure on North Vietnam more
       difficult as Chinese Communists will make much noise about collusion and sell-out. In any
       event I doubt Soviets will go beyond urging a settlement on NVN in general terms. I do not
       believe they will support any particular political terms but will probably be prepared to
       press NVN on reduction of violence. Greatest value of meeting might be in using Soviets to
       impress North Vietnamese that we are not about to capitulate and that real compromise will be
       necessary if agreement is to be reached.</p>
                        <p>4. Soviets will be glad to draw attention away from Czechoslovakia and exploit suspicions
       of our allies. On the other hand an even moderately successful meeting will diminish
       likelihood of further Soviet adventures or pressure on such issues as Berlin.</p>
                        <p>5. I should think President would wish to raise Pueblo case as Soviets could probably be
       pushed into giving us at least a little more help on that issue and mere fact of meeting
       might exercise some influence on North Koreans.</p>
                        <p>6. Even if <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> should attend meeting, Soviet
       principals will almost certainly be bound by rigid instructions and there will be little time
       in two-day meeting for them to consult Moscow.</p>
                        <pb n="778" xml:id="pg_778" facs="0806"/>
                        <p>Present regime is not noted for ability to reach quick decisions. Therefore, the more
       clearly President can indicate to Soviets in advance what he expects of them, the more likely
       agreement can be reached.</p>

                        <p>We would hope that at your luncheon with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
       you could get, even if only informally and unofficially, some insights into what Soviet
       leaders really have in mind about a possible meeting. The fact that they have not responded
       to your specific suggestion of the 16th and 17th in Geneva indicates that they may have some
       questions in a period of transition between two administrations in the United States. I wish
       to emphasize that there is no interest here in a meeting merely for its own sake or for
       cosmetic purposes at the end of an administration, although we have good information that
       their Embassy frequently passed to the press here that the President wanted a summit meeting.
       On the subject of missiles, we have done an enormous amount of work and have State, Defense,
        <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> all together
       on what we think is a reasonable and constructive position. A new administration could lose a
       great deal of time, momentum and even unity in starting all over again. Meanwhile, the
       missile race may not wait for another protracted period because actions will be taken on both
       sides which would make eventual agreement both more difficult and achievable only at higher
       levels of expenditure and danger. Further, the Middle East and Southeast Asia situations are
       urgent. We have had little encouragement from what has been said by the Russians so far that
       they anticipate any serious advances on these two areas. On the other hand, we have now
       stopped the bombing of their fellow socialist country, North Viet-Nam, and believe we are
       entitled to see them “put their stack in” to help bring peace to
       Southeast Asia. On the Middle East, I personally went over with the Egyptian Foreign Minister
       the various points arising under the November resolution of the Security Council and did so
       in a spirit which was forthcoming from Egypt's point of view and in a way that was
       not at all pleasing to Israel. The Egyptian response was negative and disappointing and
       reflected no signs of any constructive Soviet influence in Cairo.</p>
                        <p>It would be very helpful if you could make a judgment in your talk with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> as to whether they prefer to wait for a new
       administration or whether they are reluctant about being pressed hard on such problems as
       Southeast Asia and the Middle East. They may be <pb n="780" xml:id="pg_780" facs="0808"/>interested in a meeting but may prefer a somewhat later date because of the recent
       involvement of their leadership with Czechoslovakian Central Committee and Party Plenum. We
       ourselves may have a problem with those particular dates because of allied consultations but
       we could manage it. They may be expecting something more from us but I am not sure what it
       would be. The President believes that they have lost some of their interest in a meeting
       because of impressions from <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> associates. In any
       event, the present situation is that we have suggested a specific time and place and they
       have not responded. Do your best scouting job with Dobrynin. Regards.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>I gather from Sec. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> that both you and he are now
       cool to the possibility of a Summit on missiles; and I would guess that Moscow is also
        cool.<note n="2" xml:id="d330fn2">In a memorandum to the President written at 9:55 a.m. on
        December 11, Rostow reported that, according to a telegram from <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> “said that
        if the President decided not to go ahead with the meeting, that would be understood in

        they?” (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The reasons are ample:</p>
                        <p>—time is short;</p>
                        <p>—we could not go far beyond the exchange of positions and papers;</p>
                        <p>—we would have to brief in Rogers and Laird;<note n="3" xml:id="d330fn3">Secretary of State-designate William Rogers and Secretary of Defense-designate Melvin

                        <p>—we would have <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> consultation problems.</p>
                        <p>Every normal argument is for leaving it to <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>.
       And that may be the correct course.</p>
                        <p>But it may also be a decision we shall regret more than any other in the years ahead.</p>

                        <p>Nuclear agreements are always marginal and tough. If we do not hold the meeting, the new

       Time will pass. Men and situations will change. And mankind may move down the wrong fork in
       the road for what will, with hindsight, look like relatively trivial reasons.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, I suggest that the President and Secretary of State make one more assessment of
        <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and missile talk prospects in the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration, before abandoning the concept
        finally.<note n="4" xml:id="d330fn4">At the bottom of the memorandum, Johnson wrote in hand,

                        <p>I have felt impelled to prepare the enclosed memorandum which I would very much like to
       have you read before you or anyone else undertakes to open up talks at this particular point

       that it was important to bring it to your attention as promptly as possible.</p>

                        <p>Memorandum to—the President</p>
                        <p>From what I can gather from the accounts of the press interviews and rumors that I hear,
       the government still has under serious consideration the initiation during the last days of
       this administration of talks with the Soviet Union dealing with the matter of reduction or
       control of nuclear missile weapons.</p>
                        <p>As you know, I am Chairman of the General Advisory Committee created by an act of Congress
       and in accordance with the provisions <pb n="783" xml:id="pg_783" facs="0811"/>of the act
       that committee's responsibility is to advise the President, the Secretary of State
       and the Director of the Agency on all matters pertaining to arms control and disarmament. I
       have held this position since the original committee was appointed. I was also asked by
       President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> to set up the Agency for Arms
       Control and Disarmament and took over its direction until it was prepared to function under
       the act and under a new director. It is not, however, as Chairman of that committee that I
       feel I should express my views regarding the contemplated meeting with the Soviets, but as an
       individual and former government official who has had long association with matters affecting
       the security of the country. That association has included problems of armament, both
       conventional and nuclear, as well as policies in respect of arms control and disarmament. It
       has also involved extensive negotiations with representatives of the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>I have a very strong feeling that it is inadvisable to open these talks now at any level
       and certainly not at the top level. I hold these views for the following reasons:</p>
                        <p>(1) The main priority at the present moment is the repair and reinvigoration of the
       Alliance not the inception of a dialogue with the Soviet Union. Any efforts at this time to
       alter this priority will have, in my judgment, most serious effects on the Alliance. It is a
       gesture toward the Alliance which is needed at this time not a gesture toward Moscow.</p>
                        <p>(2) Sufficient weight, in my judgment, has not yet been given to the effects of the Soviet
       invasion of Czechoslovakia, the announcement of the so-called Brezhnev doctrine<note n="3" xml:id="d332fn3">Originally propounded by Soviet Communist Party spokesman Sergei Kovalev in
        an article entitled “Sovereignty and International Responsibility of Socialist
        Countries” in <hi rend="italic">Pravda,</hi> September 16, 1968. A translation is
        printed in <hi rend="italic">Current Digest of the Soviet Press,</hi> October 16, 1968, and
        in Robin Alison Remington, ed., <hi rend="italic">Winter in Prague: Documents on
         Czechoslovak Communism in Crisis</hi> (Cambridge, Mass: The MIT Press, 1969), pp.
        412–416.</note> and the threats against West Germany. Nor has sufficient weight been given
       to the altered security position of Europe and the United States which new developments have
       brought about.</p>
                        <p>(3) No matter how tentative or general the form of the initial approach to the Soviet Union
       may take by instituting it we shall be implicitly accepting a principle of no superiority, or
       expressed in a different form, of parity. No amount of semantics with the use of different
       words can alter that fact. The minute we touch our foot down in the meeting room this
       principle is implicit. This involves a major step in the development of both our strategy and
       our public opinion. The present administration and its predecessors have constantly insisted
        <pb n="784" xml:id="pg_784" facs="0812"/>that we have always been in a position of massive
       superiority in the nuclear field and that we intend to maintain this position. I have seen
       the papers which outlined the position of the United States on this matter of missiles which
       were prepared prior to the Czech invasion. There was no question in my mind nor in the mind
       of agency representatives that it did embody this principle, although it was implicit rather
       than expressed. I am not suggesting that we should continue to insist upon superiority,
       although I have questioned the assumption that parity is necessarily a more stable form of
       defense than that of superiority. My position is that the assumption of parity in whatever
       form of words it is stated should be understood by the new administration and clarified with
       the Congress, the country and the allies to a much greater degree than it has been before the
       United States enters upon meetings which commit us to it.</p>
                        <p>(4) It was a serious mistake, in my judgment, when in connection with the origination of
       the non-proliferation agreement, we first cleared a draft with the Soviet Union before we
       approached some of our most important allies and certainly the one which was most deeply
       concerned. The avidity to reach an agreement, almost any agreement, with the Soviet Union
       made us lose sight of the significant priorities. I fear we may be on the verge of making the
       same mistake again. The best way to avoid a fragmentation of Europe, the further erosion of
       the Alliance and a constructive modus vivendi with the Soviet Union is the maintenance of a
       thoroughly convincing and cohesive Allied security policy.</p>
                        <p>I am aware that there have been general expressions on the part of the Allies including the
        <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> ministers as well as resolutions in the United Nations
       regarding the advisability of our opening negotiations with the Soviet Union leading to the
       reduction of nuclear armaments, but I believe these expressions only reflect the general
       pressure for such reductions without taking into necessary account the implications of the
       Czech affair, the alteration in the power balance (which certainly has taken place) or the
       character of reduction or control of armaments which the general security situation now
       justifies. It is much more than a matter of comparison of the number of warheads of the
       United States and the Soviet Union or the general comparison of the Soviet-United States
       position. It is now a matter of the whole allied deterrent. The studies made before the Czech
       invasion are, in my judgment, not up to date and no temporarily comforting assurances on the
       part of Moscow in regard to Berlin, Rumania, Yugoslavia, etc., alter the fundamental fact of
       the deployment of Soviet troops further west and in greater quantity than was the case even
       during the war. The Czech invasion demonstrated a mobility speed and capacity to reinforce on
       the part of the Soviets which we, with all our vaunted airlift possibilities, cannot now
       remotely duplicate.</p>
                        <pb n="785" xml:id="pg_785" facs="0813"/>
                        <p>The Czech invasion, together with the greatly increased nuclear and conventional potential
       of the Soviets and the emergence of the Soviets and Soviet influence into the Mediterranean,
       constitute a new situation of which we should take advantage in dealing with our allies. The
       next meeting, in my judgment, should be in this country with the allies and there the matter
       of determining together what is the overall need in the light of the new developments should
       be dealt with before any further overtures are made to the Soviets. If this procedure and
       priority is not followed, I very much fear we shall only be encouraging our European Allies
       to rely more heavily on the so-called détente and the United States ultimate
       strategic deterrent without doing their share to maintain the immediate and probably more
       convincing deterrent of well trained and well supported forces in the field. A joint and
       serious review of the whole security position will tend to recreate the cooperative spirit of
       the Alliance which is so greatly needed at this time.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets are bound to exploit with their allies and their potential satellites any hasty
       meeting with us as an acquiescence in the consequences of the Czech invasion. In spite of all
        <hi rend="italic">The New York Times'</hi> editorializing, there is no need for
       haste. If the program has merit for us and the Soviets, its advantages will not disappear
       overnight. The value of the program to the Soviet Union is very great and will extend into at
       least 1969. It will be just as important to them in 1969 as in 1968 to reduce our nuclear
       potential and it will be just as important to them to have us enter into a non-proliferation
       treaty which consolidates their near monopoly of nuclear weapons and forever excludes
       Germany, one of our allies, from having them. It is no argument to contend that the Joint
       Chiefs of Staff may withdraw their support to a reduction in the course of another
       administration due to a possible change in Joint Chiefs of Staff personnel. Such an argument
       merely confirms the fact that there exists a tendency to preclude the new administration from
       entire freedom of action in a matter that will deeply concern the country and for with the
       new administration is bound to have to assume the ultimate responsibility.</p>
                        <p>I know that there has been sustained and thoughtful work done on this problem in the
       preparation for the meeting with the Soviet Union. Though most of it was done before the
       Czech affair occurred, I am sure considerable thought has been given it since then but these
       studies will be available for the new administration to review and to some degree for the
       allies to review before a meeting with the Soviets takes place. The problem is, as I happen
       to know, most complex and practically impossible for the new administration to grasp with all
       its implications between now and the time which I guess is contemplated for the initiation of
       the talks. I really do not understand how any group of people, including those just
       designated by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> to become his <pb n="786" xml:id="pg_786" facs="0814"/>Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense, can be expected to
       have a knowledgeable attitude on this vital issue and yet I feel certain that the issue is so
       great and so significant, one can be quite certain the new administration is going to have to
       give thorough, sincere and prompt thought to it. This opportunity should, in my judgment, be
       afforded them free of any pressure which an immediate meeting with the Soviet representatives
       would entail.</p>

                        <p>288756. Subject: High-Visibility Exchanges with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
       Eastern Europe.</p>
                        <p>1. We have decided to resume gradually high-visibility exchanges with Soviet Union and
       other Warsaw Pact participants in action against Czechoslovakia. Decision is based on
       long-term advantage to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> of high-visibility exchanges with
       Soviet Union and other <gloss target="#t_EE1">EE</gloss> countries and results of our
       consultations with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Allies. Just as suspension of these
       exchanges in August served our purposes, their resumption is also in our interest as one
       facet of our overall policy toward <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Eastern
       Europe.</p>
                        <p>2. Insofar as Soviet Union is concerned, this decision involves resumption of negotiations
       for the appearance of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> performing arts groups in the Soviet
       Union and negotiations for “Education—USA” exhibit. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. We are accordingly seeking two appropriate American performing
       arts groups which could be sent to <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in 1969, one as
       early as possible to balance <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> State
       Symphony's <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> tour scheduled begin mid-February.
       Acceptance <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> State Symphony remains contingent on
       signature of contract for one <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> performing arts group and
       satisfactory progress in negotiations for exhibit and second performing arts group. Embassy
       Moscow will be instructed to make this clear <pb n="787" xml:id="pg_787" facs="0815"/>to
       Soviets at such time as we are able to provide negotiating instructions. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. Policy decision also provides for reversion to pre-August 20 policies on exchanges with
       Poland, Hungary and Bulgaria.</p>
                        <p>4. We do not plan to volunteer any public statement of policy but will respond to inquiries
       as change becomes known by statement that our attitude toward Soviet and <gloss target="#t_EE1">EE</gloss> action against Czechoslovakia has been made clear both
       unilaterally and in concert with our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Allies. Attitude
       is in no way altered by the resumption of exchanges.</p>
                        <p>5. For USNATO: You may draw upon foregoing in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> December
       18 during discussion of political subjects (Agenda Item I). In informing <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> of decision on resumption of exchanges, you should mention that
       decision partly due to fact that other Allies appear to be going ahead already with major
       exchange activities, as well as general agreement at December 10 <gloss target="#t_POLAD1">POLAD</gloss>'s (USNATO 6216)<note n="2" xml:id="d333fn2">Dated December 10.
        (Ibid., POL <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss> E–<gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss>
        W)</note> that it would be appropriate to begin to modify restraints imposed on contracts
       with Warsaw Pact Five after invasion of Czechoslovakia. Another reason for our decision is
       desire to preserve exchanges program that includes activities of prime interest to us,
       especially since impact of performing arts groups and exhibits is invariably greater within
       closed Soviet society than in West.</p>
                        <p>You should then make following additional points:</p>
                        <p>a. We are seriously concerned that Allies, in renewing exchange activities, may give
       collective impression of desiring precipitate return to pre-August 20 normalcy.</p>
                        <p>b. Too rapid a renewal of exchanges could nullify much of psychological impact of November
       Ministerial Meeting decisions and affect public resolve within Allied countries to meet
       contributions to improve <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense posture.</p>
                        <p>c. We therefore strongly urge that Allies (1) resume exchanges with Warsaw Pact Five as
       gradually as possible; (2) try to keep closely in step on this issue through close
       consultations; and (3) keep public statements of this resumption as low key as possible.</p>

        (Ibid., Country Files-Europe-U.S.S.R., Box 66, Soviet Contacts (Sedov), 1968–69) <persName corresp="#p_TYN1">Yuri Tcherniakov</persName> was Minister Counselor at the Soviet Embassy
        in Washington. Robert Ellsworth was a <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> aide who,
        according to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> in <hi rend="italic">In
         Confidence,</hi> pp. 186–187, informed <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> at a

        later,” Ellsworth explained that <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
        “seriously objected” to President Johnson's plans for a
        summit meeting; and “a week later, ”<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> passed to Ellsworth a Soviet reply stating that <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> might not have been aware that it was President Johnson
        who wanted a meeting and that “'it is up to the American side to form
        its attitude to such a summit. As to us, we do not adjust our views to momentary
        advantages.'” (Ibid., p. 187) Although <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s excerpt from the Soviet message differs in wording from
        the message, he is presumably referring to the same one.</note>

                        <p>I have informed Moscow of our conversation on the 8th of December when you stated President
        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s considerations concerning a
       possible meeting of President Johnson with the Soviet leaders.</p>
                        <p>In this connection I am instructed to convey you for President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> the following.</p>
                        <p>Since, as it is apparent now, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> is obviously
       not aware of all the circumstances of this matter, we would like to state for his information
       that the question of President Johnson's wish to meet with the Soviet leaders was
       raised on the initiative of the American side at the beginning of July this year. Then in the
       middle of September and again at the end of November the American side—on its own
       initiative as well—returned to this question.</p>
                        <p>Supposing that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> was informed of the course
       of affairs in the exchange of opinions between Moscow and Washington on this matter, we on
       our part were planning nevertheless to find out his attitude towards the possibility of
       President Johnson's meeting with the Soviet leaders before any final decision was
       reached on this matter.</p>
                        <p>Now the situation in this respect has been clarified. It is of course difficult for us to
       judge the character of American side's intentions concerning a summit meeting and
       hence—how successful it could be under present circumstances. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> is of course in a better position to judge this.</p>
                        <pb n="789" xml:id="pg_789" facs="0817"/>
                        <p>So far as our own attitude to such meetings is concerned we can say absolute firmly that
       this attitude is being determined not by any motivations of the moment. We approached and
       still approach the question of such meetings with all seriousness, having in mind that for
       the leaders of such two states as the United States and the Soviet Union there is always
       something to exchange the opinions of in the interests of our two countries as well as in the
       interests of universal peace and security.</p>
                        <p>As to the problem of curbing the race in the strategic armaments we can state also with all
       certainty that our approach to the discussion of this problem—be it at summit, be
       it at any other level—is most serious. We had proceeded precisely from this when
       an agreement was reached between the Governments of the Soviet Union and the United States,
       which was proclaimed on the 1st of July this year, to enter in the near future into
       negotiations concerning complex limitation and reduction of offensive strategic nuclear
       weapons delivery systems as well as systems of defense against ballistic missiles.</p>
                        <p>The problem of limitation and subsequent reduction of strategic weapons is undoubtedly one
       of the biggest questions in the relations between our countries. The results of discussion of
       this problem will, of course, depend on positions of both sides. If the Government of the
       United States really wishes, as we do, to facilitate the cessation of armaments race then
       there is no doubt that these results can be positive.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>As I indicated to you earlier, I met with Boris Sedov of the Soviet Embassy this evening. I
       made the following points to him:</p>
                        <p>—The President-elect meant it when he said that this was to be an era of
       negotiation not confrontation.</p>
                        <p>—The Soviets will find that the President-elect is open minded, precise, and
       interested in lasting settlements based on the real interests of both countries. Settlements
       cannot be based on trying to take away the options of the other side. Lasting settlements
       must reflect real interests.</p>
                        <p>—A crucial test of Soviet intentions to improve relations with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> will be whether the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> accepts
       a summit meeting between now and January 20. If such a meeting is held, the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Administration will be forced to find some way to make it
       clear that we will not be boxed in, and that we will move at our own pace at a time we decide
       to be appropriate. In other words, we believe that the only purpose of a summit meeting now
       can be propaganda to embarrass the new Administration. We would react accordingly.<note n="2" xml:id="d335fn2">Commenting in his memoirs on Johnson's proposal that both men
        attend a summit in late 1968, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> stated that he
        “saw no solid basis for concluding that the Soviet leaders were prepared to
        negotiate seriously on any critical issue. Nor did I want to be boxed in by any decisions
        that were made before I took office.” (<hi rend="italic">The Memoirs of <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard Nixon</persName>,</hi> p. 345)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>—On the assumption that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will do
       nothing to disturb the atmosphere either by summit conferences or by fomenting crises, the
       new Administration is very interested in serious talks. The tendency in the past few years
       has been to worry about the “atmosphere” of relations between the two
       great powers. The new Administration is convinced that there are real and substantial
       differences between the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and the Soviet Union and that it is
       these differences which must be negotiated.</p>
                        <p>—On the strategic missile talks, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> is intent upon an assessment of our strategic position before moving into
       the negotiation <pb n="791" xml:id="pg_791" facs="0819"/>stage. Our analysis of the issue,
       however, will be influenced by Soviet willingness to negotiate seriously on other
       questions—particularly Vietnam and the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>—Assuming Soviet willingness to negotiate on such issues, arms talks could be
       held simultaneously. Such judgments will also influence the ratification of the Non
       Proliferation Treaty, which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> has called a
       matter of timing.</p>
                        <p>—It would be useful to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> if the
       Soviet Union were prepared to indicate to us a willingness to negotiate on these outstanding
       issues, and to provide us with some indication of the positions they would take thereon.</p>
