                        Volume XXIII, Congo, 1960–1968</ref>.</p>
                <p>This volume is part of a <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> subseries that
                    documents the most important issues in the foreign policy of President Lyndon B.
                    Johnson. However, this volume also includes documentation on U.S. foreign policy
                    toward Congo-Léopoldville during the administrations of Presidents Dwight D.
                    Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy. It is therefore a retrospective, composite
                    volume, which covers U.S. policy in Congo-Léopoldville from March 1960 through
                    December 1968. It should be read as a supplement to <ref target="frus1958-60v14"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1958–1960, Volume XIV,

                <p>The first part of the volume, covering 1960–1963, documents the chaotic nature of
                    the Congo crisis and the pervasive influence of covert U.S. Government policies
                    in the newly independent nation designed to install a pro-Western regime and
                    limit Soviet influence. The second part of the volume, covering 1964–1968,
                    chronicles the evolution of U.S. policy towards Congo-Léopoldville. It documents
                    the continuation of covert political action programs, the U.S. role in providing
                    paramilitary and air support, and efforts to develop a more strategic long-term
                    approach to U.S. relations. </p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The Historian
                    of the Department of State is charged with responsibility for the preparation of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The General Editor and the
                    staff of the Office of the Historian, plan, research, select, and edit the
                    volumes in the series. Official regulations codifying specific standards for the
                    selection and editing of documents for the series were first promulgated by
                    Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925. These regulations, with
                    minor modifications, guided the series through 1991. A new statutory charter for
                    the preparation of the series was established by Public Law 102–138, the Foreign
                    Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993, which was signed by
                    President George Bush on October 28, 1991. Section 198 of P.L. 102–138 added a
                    new Title IV to the Department of State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC
                    4351, <hi rend="italic">et seq</hi>.). The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be a thorough, accurate, and
                    reliable record of major United States foreign policy decisions and significant
                    United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the series should include all
                    records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major foreign policy
                    decisions and actions of the United States Government. The statute also confirms
                    the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles of historical
                    objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or deletions made
                    without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been made; the
                    published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in reaching
                    a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of concealing a
                    defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30 years after the events
                    recorded.</p>

                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Focus of Research and Principles of Selection for <hi rend="roman">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1964–1968, Volume XXIII, Congo,
                    1960–1968</p>

                <p>This volume is part of a <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> subseries that
                    documents the most important issues in the foreign policy of President Lyndon B.
                    Johnson. However, this volume also includes documentation on U.S. foreign policy
                    toward Congo-Léopoldville during the administrations of Presidents Dwight D.
                    Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy. It is therefore a retrospective, composite
                    volume, which covers U.S. policy in Congo-Léopoldville from March 1960 until
                    December 1968. It should <pb n="IV" facs="0005" xml:id="pg_IV"/>be read as a
                    supplement to <ref target="frus1958-60v14"><hi rend="italic">Foreign
                            Relations,</hi> 1958–1960, Volume XIV, Africa</ref>, and <ref target="frus1961-63v20"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1961–1963,
                        Volume XX, Congo Crisis</ref>. Both volumes provide thorough and detailed
                    coverage of overt U.S. policy toward Congo-Léopoldville during the 1960–1963
                    period including: U.S. support for UN intervention; diplomatic efforts to bring
                    about a peaceful resolution of the Katanga secessions; and U.S. efforts to
                    promote stability, install a pro-Western regime and limit Soviet influence. The
                    volumes did not, however, contain documentation of the U.S. covert political
                    action program. There were also no records in the two volumes concerning U.S.
                    planning and preparation for the possible assassination of Patrice Lumumba. At
                    the time these volumes were published, Department of State historians had no
                    access to sensitive records still in the custody of the Central Intelligence
                    Agency (CIA). In 1991, however, Congressional legislation was passed and signed
                    into law that affirmed the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series
                    “shall be a thorough, accurate, and reliable documentary record of major United
                    States foreign policy decisions and significant United States diplomatic
                    activity” and required U.S. Government departments and agencies to provide
                    Department of State historians with “full and complete access to the records
                    pertinent to United States foreign policy decisions and actions.” Department of
                    State historians were therefore able to conduct comprehensive research on the
                    U.S. role in covertly shaping, influencing and implementing U.S. foreign policy
                    for this volume.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1964–1968, Volume XXIII, Congo, was
                    originally conceived as a volume documenting U.S. policy during the Johnson
                    administration. However, in March 1997 the Department of State Advisory
                    Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation called into question the
                    completeness and accuracy of the previously released Eisenhower and Kennedy
                    volumes on this topic. At the Committee’s suggestion, the Office of the
                    Historian delayed publication of this volume to incorporate all relevant
                    material regarding U.S. covert actions missing in the earlier volumes. This
                    volume consists of a selection of the most significant of those previously
                    unavailable documents.</p>

                <p>The first part of the volume, covering 1960 to 1963, contains numerous CIA cables
                    to and from the Station in Léopoldville, which document the chaotic nature of
                    the Congo crisis and the pervasive influence of U.S. Government covert actions
                    in the newly independent nation. They also provide the analysis that is at the
                    core of policy formulation with regard to covert action. A significant portion
                    of this intelligence information is presented in editorial notes, in an effort
                    to release as much of the pertinent information as possible given the extensive
                    declassification challenges. Covert political action was only one part of U.S.
                    policy during this period and must be viewed within the broader context. Thus,
                    this portion of the volume is not intended to stand on its <pb n="V" facs="0006" xml:id="pg_V"/>own and should be used in conjunction with <ref target="frus1958-60v14"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1958–1960,
                        Volume XIV, Africa</ref>, and <ref target="frus1961-63v20"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1961–1963, Volume XX, Congo Crisis</ref>, in
                    order to gain a comprehensive picture of U.S. policy toward Congo-Léopoldville
                    during this period.</p>

                <p>The second part of the volume, covering 1964 to 1968, documents the continuation
                    of the U.S. covert political action programs and their role in providing
                    paramilitary and air support to the Congolese Government in an effort to quell
                    provincial rebellions. While CIA cables are an important component of the
                    documentation, other agency positions are represented in cables, memoranda,
                    memoranda of conversation, and analytical papers. This documentation illustrates
                    a gradual shift in policy to engage other nations in the stabilization of
                    Congo-Léopoldville, including the joint U.S.-Belgian rescue of European and U.S.
                    hostages during Operation Dragon Rouge and the efforts of the Department of
                    State to convince other nations, including Belgium and members of the
                    Organization of African Unity, to support the Congo-Léopoldville Government and
                    condemn outside interference. Additionally, this portion documents efforts by
                    the Department of State, National Security Council, Joint Chiefs of Staff,
                    Department of Defense, and CIA to abandon the ad hoc approach to U.S. relations
                    that characterized the earlier period and develop a more strategic, long-term
                    approach.</p>

                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time.
                    Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and date of the
                    conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the chief technical editor. The documents
                    are reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations,
                    which are described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed
                    according to accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents
                    within the limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied by the
                    editors for each document included in the volume. Words or phrases underlined in
                    the source text are printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are
                    preserved as found in the original text, and a list of abbreviations is included
                    in the front matter of each volume. Spelling, capitalization, punctuation, and
                    place names are retained as found in the original text, except that obvious
                    typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the
                    documents are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic
                    type; an addition in roman type.</p>
                <pb n="VI" facs="0007" xml:id="pg_VI"/>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). For this volume, where possible, the
                    editors have used bracketed insertions to indicate names, titles, or agencies in
                    place of cryptonyms that are not declassified. When this is not possible, the
                    amount and nature of classified material is indicated by the number of lines or
                    pages of text that were omitted. In some cases, when more than one individual
                    whose name cannot be declassified is discussed in the body of a document, they
                    have been designated by the editors as “[<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                        1</persName>],” [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>],” etc.
                    for clarity. The identity designation of a specific individual is valid for a
                    single document only, and is not consistent throughout the volume. An individual
                    designated as “[Identity1]” in <ref target="#d1">Document 1</ref>, for example,
                    may be referred to as “[<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>]” in
                    subsequent documents. Entire documents withheld for declassification purposes
                    have been accounted for and are listed with headings, source notes, and number
                    of pages not declassified in their chronological place. All brackets that appear
                    in the original text are so identified in footnotes.</p>

                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the source of the document,
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates
                    whether the President or his major policy advisers read the document.</p>

                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. In addition, this volume
                    also contains editorial notes that summarize extensively redacted documents in
                    order to provide narrative cohesion. Information derived from memoirs and other
                    first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to supplement or explicate
                    the official record.</p>

                <p>The numbers in the index refer to document numbers rather than to page

                    Documentation</p>

                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute, reviews records, advises,
                    and makes recommendations concerning the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series. The Advisory Committee monitors the overall
                    compilation and editorial process of the series and advises on all aspects of
                    the preparation and declassification of the series. Although the Advisory
                    Committee does not attempt to review the contents of individual volumes in<pb n="VII" facs="0008" xml:id="pg_VII"/> the series, it does monitor the
                    overall process and makes recommendations on particular problems that come to
                    its attention.</p>

                <p>Because of the history and significance of this volume, the Advisory Committee
                    offered advice throughout its lengthy preparation and took the unusual step of
                    delegating a member to review the final manuscript. Although the committee
                    appreciates that some documentation remains classified and does not appear in
                    the volume, it assesses the volume as a reliable guide to the trajectory of U.S.
                    policy toward the Congo from 1960 until 1968 and an exceptionally valuable
                    addition to the historical record. Accordingly, the committee recommended its
                    publication.</p>

                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    Department of State, conducted the declassification review of the documents
                    published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with the
                    standards set forth in 22 U.S.C. 4353, and Executive Orders 12356, 12958 and
                    13526 on Classified National Security Information and applicable laws.</p>

                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State and
                    other concerned agencies of the U.S. Government. The declassification review of
                    this volume began in 1994 and was finally completed in 2013. It resulted in the
                    decision to withhold 4 documents in full, excise a paragraph or more in 12
                    documents, and make excisions of less than a paragraph in 222 documents.</p>

                <p>As a result of the sui generis nature of this volume, it has undergone an
                    extensive and prolonged declassification review and appeals process. The Office
                    of the Historian is confident, on the basis of the research conducted in
                    preparing this volume and as a result of the declassification review process
                    described above, that the documentation, annotation, and editorial notes
                    presented here provide a broadly accurate account of the main lines of U.S.
                    policy toward Congo-Léopoldville from 1960 until 1968.</p>

                <p>The Foreign Relations statute requires that the published record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all records needed to
                    provide comprehensive documentation on major U.S. foreign policy decisions and
                    significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires that government
                    agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government engaged in
                    foreign policy formulation, execution, or support cooperate with the Department
                    of State Historian by providing full and complete access to records pertinent to
                    foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected
                    records.</p>

                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the
                    central files of the Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”)
                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department’s Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State and foreign officials and the files of
                    overseas diplomatic posts. All the Department’s indexed central files for
                    1960–1968 have been permanently transferred to the National Archives and Records
                    Administration at College Park, Maryland (Archives II). The Department’s
                    decentralized office (or lot) files covering this period that the National
                    Archives deems worthy of permanent retention, have been transferred from the
                    Department’s custody to Archives II.</p>

                <p>The editors of the Foreign Relations series also have full access to the papers
                    of President Johnson and other White House foreign policy records. Presidential
                    papers maintained and preserved at the Presidential libraries include some of
                    the most significant foreign affairs-related documentation from the Department
                    of State and other Federal agencies, including the National Security Council,
                    the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs
                    of Staff.</p>

                    1964–1968, Volume XXIII, Congo, 1960–1968</p>

                <p>This retrospective volume on the Congo, 1960–1968, is a documentary history of
                    U.S. relations with Congo-Léopoldville, including U.S. involvement in the Congo
                    Crisis. As such, the first part of this volume relies heavily on CIA documents.
                    Much of the documentation is in Jobs 78–00435R and 79–00149A, which contain
                    cables between CIA <pb n="XII" facs="0013" xml:id="pg_XII"/>headquarters and the
                    Station in Léopoldville. They also contain field reports and analytical papers.
                    Job 81–00966R contains an extensive collection of papers and memoranda prepared
                    for the Special Group and the 303 Committee. In some instances, names of files
                    and collections have not been declassified. Special Group and 303 Committee
                    meeting minutes and summaries are available in several collections in the
                    National Security Council Intelligence Files, specifically: Special Group
                    Meeting Minutes, Special Group Minutes and Agenda, Special Group Minutes and
                    Approvals and 303 Committee Files Minutes. These collections contain
                    documentation of the deliberations of the high-level interdepartmental groups
                    set up to approve and supervise covert operations. Finally, the Church
                    Committee’s Interim Report provides extensive testimony on the plot to
                    assassinate Patrice Lumumba.</p>

                <p>The records of the Department of State are crucial to understanding the evolution
                    of U.S. policy towards Congo-Léopoldville in the aftermath of the Congo Crisis.
                    The Department’s central files contain the cable traffic recording U.S.
                    diplomatic relations with the Congolese Government and other nations, memoranda
                    of diplomatic conversations, as well as action and information memoranda. The
                    richest collection of cable traffic for 1964–1968 is in POL 23–9 The Congo,
                    which also contains extensive documentation on Operation Dragon Rouge. Defense
                    records in the central files provide documentation on U.S. efforts to train the
                    Congolese National Army and to provide planes and equipment for their use.</p>

                <p>The Johnson Library, National Security File, Country Files, Congo, contains
                    interagency memoranda and telegrams regarding ongoing instability in the Congo
                    after 1963, including the hostage situation in Stanleyville which resulted in
                    Operation Dragon Rouge. The file also contains documentation regarding efforts
                    to convince the Organization of African Unity and Belgium to support the Tshombe
                    government and denounce outside interference in the provinces by mercenaries,
                    neighboring states and others.</p>

                                        January 1963, the Department of State continued to use the
                                        decimal central file system familiar to users of previous
                                        volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                                        series. The following file was most useful in compiling this

                                        adopted a subject-numeric central file system. Under this
                                        system, files on the Republic of the Congo (now Zaire) were
                                        designated THE CONGO, and files on the Congo Republic
                                        (capital at Brazzaville) were designated CONGO.<list>

                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>The drive for independence in the Belgian Congo began in earnest during the 1950s
                    with the independence of neighboring territories and the formation of a number
                    of Congolese political groups, including ABAKO, BALUBAKAT, and CONACAT. Most of
                    these groups were based upon regional and/or tribal and cultural affiliation,
                    but an exception to this was the Mouvement National Congolais (MNC), a national
                    party whose leadership included Patrice Lumumba. All of these groups sought
                    independence from Belgium, but they were divided over whether the new nation
                    should form a central or federalist government. Belgium granted full
                    independence on June 30, 1960, and set the stage for elections in May.</p>

                <p>During the pre-independence period, the Eisenhower administration grew
                    increasingly wary of the potential for Communist-bloc interference in the
                    election process and the new government. The administration was particularly
                    concerned about Lumumba, who it viewed as harboring pro-Communist sentiments.
                    Since Lumumba enjoyed broad national support in the Congo, the administration
                    feared he posed a potential threat to U.S. interests and goals in Sub-Saharan
                    Africa. In response, the U.S. Government began to consider a political action
                    program in March 1960, designed to support pro-Western candidates and
                    marginalize Marxist groups.</p>

                    <head>1. Editorial Note</head>
                    <p>Within 3 weeks of the day the Congo gained its independence on June 30, 1960,
                        disorder and rioting broke out, Belgium flew in paratroopers to protect its
                        citizens and protect order, and Katanga Province seceded. The new Congolese
                        Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Patrice Lumumba</persName>, whom
                        U.S. officials already believed was a dangerous, pro-Communist radical,
                        turned to the Soviet Union for political support and military assistance,
                        confirming the worst fears of U.S. policymakers. In August 1960, the U.S.
                        Government launched a covert political program in the Congo lasting almost 7
                        years, initially aimed at eliminating <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> from power and replacing him with a more moderate,
                        pro-Western leader. The U.S. Government provided advice and financial
                        subsidies. At the same time, based on authorization from President <persName corresp="#p_EDD_1">Eisenhower</persName>’s statements at an <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> meeting on August 18, 1960, discussions
                        began to develop highly sensitive, tightly-held plans to assassinate
                            <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>. After <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>’s death at the hands of Congolese
                        rivals in January 1961, the U.S. Government authorized the provision of
                        paramilitary and air support to the new Congolese Government.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Operation Supporting Anti-Communist Congolese
                        Politicians</p>
                    <p>Even before Congolese independence, the U.S. Government attempted to ensure
                        election of a pro-Western government by identifying and supporting
                        individual pro-U.S. leaders. During August 1960, reporting from the Station
                        in Leopoldville warned Washington that unless Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> was stopped in the near future, he
                        would become a strongman and establish a government under the influence of,
                        or completely controlled by, Communists. Washington authorized limited funds
                        for an operation in the Congo with the objective of replacing <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> with a pro-Western group. These
                        funds were to be channeled in such a way as to conceal the U.S. Government
                        as a source.</p>
                    <p>On September 14, 1960, Congolese Army Chief of Staff <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Joseph Mobutu</persName> carried out a virtual coup
                        by establishing a College of Commissioners to administer the country on an
                        interim basis. The Station provided the new government with covert funds as
                        part of a general program of covert support, using the previously
                        established, not attributable to the United States, channel. In addition,
                        the covert program included <pb n="2" facs="0035" xml:id="pg_2"/> organizing
                        mass demonstrations, distributing anti-Communist pamphlets, and providing
                        propaganda material for broadcasts.</p>
                    <p>The Special Group (later the 303 Committee), the high-level interdepartmental
                        group set up to approve and supervise covert operations, made its first
                        approval of major funding to strengthen <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobuto</persName>’s de facto government, in order to prevent <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> from regaining control, on October
                        27, 1960. U.S. covert support continued during the series of political
                        crises that followed.</p>
                    <p>After the Special Group’s authorization in October 1960, a pattern evolved.
                        One of the Congolese leaders urgently asked the Station for funds to avert
                        an imminent crisis, such as the establishment by <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> supporters of a rival government
                        in Stanleyville, an army mutiny, or a parliamentary defeat. Expenditure of
                        at least some of the requested funds was almost always authorized.
                        Periodically, the Special Group would meet and approve overall funding and
                        direction of covert operations. On February 14, 1961, following a near
                        mutiny of the Congolese army and police, the Special Group approved an even
                        larger request to the Congolese Government through clandestine channels.
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName>’s Special
                        Assistant for National Security Affairs, <persName corresp="#p_BMG_1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>, reported to the Special Group on June 21,
                        1961, that the President had approved a <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                        recommendation, with Department of State concurrence, for a substantial
                        contingency fund. The fund was to be used for a covert political action
                        program to help elect a pro-U.S. prime minister and government during the
                        upcoming parliamentary session at the University of Lovanium scheduled to
                        convene in late July. On August 2, 1961, the Congolese parliament approved a
                        predominantly moderate government headed by Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Cyrille Adoula</persName>.</p>
                    <p>On November 22, 1961, the Special Group approved additional funding to
                        strengthen the Adoula government as a moderate force and eventually build a
                        new cohesive national political party. This carried the funding through
                        fiscal year 1962 and averted two parliamentary crises: a proposed censure of
                        then Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> in
                        June and a vote of no confidence in the government in late November.</p>
                    <p>In March 1963, the Embassy warned that terminating U.S. financial support
                        would probably result in the fall of the government. Responding to the
                        warning, the Special Group on April 25 approved funding for <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1964 for continuation of the covert action
                        program supporting the government. The Congolese were subsequently warned,
                        however, that the United States would not continue the crash ad hoc funding
                        it had provided in the past and wanted instead an organized program leading
                        to formation of a national political party that would act as a political
                        instrument in the forthcoming national elections. On November 6, 1963, the
                        Station in Leopoldville submitted an additional <pb n="3" facs="0036" xml:id="pg_3"/>budget to support establishment of a national political
                        party. This was approved on November 8.</p>
                    <p>On June 1, 1964, a revised budget was approved for the project for <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1964. Following former Katanga premier
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Moise Tshombe</persName>’s appointment as
                        Prime Minister in July 1964 and the fall of Stanleyville to rebel forces in
                        early August, the program continued to provide limited support to selected
                        Congolese leaders. On June 30, 1966, the program was formally terminated on
                        the recommendation of <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and Department of
                        State officials that it was no longer necessary to engage in large-scale
                        political funding in the Congo. However, limited funding continued into
                        1968.</p>

                        Assassination Attempt</p>
                    <p>On August 27, 1960, Director of Central Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_DAW_1">Allen Dulles</persName> cabled the Leopoldville
                        Station Chief that there was agreement in “high quarters” that <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>’s removal must be an urgent and
                        prime objective. <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>’s Deputy Director for
                        Plans, <persName corresp="#p_BRM_1">Bissell</persName>, told a <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> scientist in late summer or early fall
                        1960 to have biological materials ready at short notice for the
                        assassination of an unspecified African leader and that he (<persName corresp="#p_BRM_1">Bissell</persName>) had Presidential authorization
                        for such an operation. In September 1960, the Chief of <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>’s Africa Division, <persName corresp="#p_TBR_1">Bronson Tweedy</persName>, instructed the scientist
                        to take the materials to the Congo and deliver instructions to the Station
                        Chief to mount an operation if it could be done securely. The scientist
                        traveled to Leopoldville, but <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s coup on September 14 resulted in <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> becoming a de facto prisoner in
                        the Prime Minister’s residence guarded by U.N. forces who were in turn
                        surrounded by Congolese troops. The scientist returned to the United States
                        on October 5, but planning continued in Leopoldville to try to implement the
                        assassination operation.</p>
                    <p>On October 15, <persName corresp="#p_TBR_1">Tweedy</persName> cabled the
                        Station in Leopoldville that “disposition” of <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> remained the highest priority. It was subsequently
                        reported that <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> was so closely
                        guarded that he could not be approached. On November 27, 1960, <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> escaped but was recaptured by
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s forces on December 1.
                        On January 17, 1961, the Station reported that <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> had been removed from the Thysville military camp to
                        Elizabethville in Katanga province and had been beaten. Between January 17
                        and February 7, <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>’s fate was
                        unknown, although there was widespread speculation that he was dead. On
                        February 7, a Field Report informed Washington that <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> and his two companions had been
                        executed on January 17 by Katangan soldiers and a Belgian officer.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Covert Support of the Congolese Air Force</p>
                    <p>In October 1962, the Congolese Government asked the United States to provide
                        jet fighters, pilots, several transport aircraft, trucks <pb n="4" facs="0037" xml:id="pg_4"/>and other military equipment to fight leftist
                        rebels. It was subsequently authorized for the Congolese Government to
                        contract for the services of pilots. On December 7, 1962, the Special Group
                        approved a proposal to provide additional personnel and logistical support
                        to the Congolese Air Force (<gloss target="#t_CAF_1">CAF</gloss>).</p>
                    <p>On April 24, 1964, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>
                        authorized the Department of Defense to provide the <gloss target="#t_CAF_1">CAF</gloss> with six T–28, ten C–47, and six H–21 aircraft, plus a
                        6-month supply of parts and ammunition. The Special Group approved a
                        proposal on May 28, 1964, to provide covert support to the <gloss target="#t_CAF_1">CAF</gloss> for maintaining the six U.S.-provided T–28
                        aircraft and a minimal helicopter rescue capability, in addition to
                        continued operation of the current six T–6 aircraft. The program was further
                        expanded with 303 Committee approval on August 24, 1964, when rebellion
                        throughout the eastern half of the Congo threatened the government’s
                        survival.</p>
                    <p>On October 28, 1965, the 303 Committee approved a request for continuation of
                        covert support to the <gloss target="#t_CAF_1">CAF</gloss> at its current
                        funding level. A memorandum for the 303 Committee, dated February 5, 1966,
                        proposed continuing covert funding of the air program through CY 1966 at a
                        reduced level, and on February 17, the 303 Committee reduced the air program
                        again. At Deputy Director of Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_HRI_1">Helms</persName>’ request, the Committee agreed to await the results of
                        a Joint Chiefs of Staff study to determine the Congo’s military needs. On
                        July 19, 1966, the 303 Committee approved by telephone contingency air
                        support if a coup were mounted against <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>.</p>
                    <p>On October 10, 1966, the 303 Committee was informed that a State-Defense-CIA
                        working group had been established to draw up plans for the phase-out of the
                        air program. The Committee agreed in early November that a turnover of the
                        U.S.-operated Congolese Air Force to the host government should be effected
                        with all convenient speed, with minimum sacrifice of efficiency and order.
                        On March 3, 1967, a progress report warned that the pace of the phase-out
                        had been delayed and might require underwriting beyond the original
                        estimated date of June 30, 1967, on a month-to-month basis. On March 8, the
                        303 Committee directed that the project be liquidated as soon as
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>A June 14 progress report alerted the 303 Committee to the problems arising
                        from the Congolese Government’s continued failure to meet its commitment to
                        deposit funds in the account of a maintenance company originally set up
                        under Congolese Government sponsorship to service Congolese aircraft.
                        Finally on June 16, 1967, the Committee refused to authorize further
                        support. The next month, however, a mutiny of white mercenaries and Katangan
                        forces broke out and the 303 Committee directed that the project be extended
                        to December 31, 1967. On November 22, the Committee approved a Department of
                        State <pb n="5" facs="0038" xml:id="pg_5"/>recommendation that the contracts
                        of pilots hired on September 4 to fly for the Congolese Government also be
                        extended to December 31. In May 1968, the project was terminated.</p>

                        Program</p>
                    <p>On August 13, 1964, the 303 Committee approved a proposal to provide covert
                        financial aid and other support to be used periodically as needed for
                        assuring tribal support of pro-Western Congolese leaders in critical areas
                        and also to supplement the pay of white military technicians working for the
                        Congolese Government. In early 1965, a capability was established to
                        interdict supplies going to the Congolese rebels via Lake Albert and Lake
                        Tanganyika, creating a “pocket navy” comprised of eight craft belonging to
                        the Congolese Government and five U.S.-owned craft on Lake Tanganyika, which
                        would be under general U.S. control.</p>

                        1966, additional funds were requested to finance a greatly expanded maritime
                        operation based in Albertville, to support selected tribal elements in the
                        Northeast Congo, and to provide a contingency fund for use in preserving the
                        existing political balance. On September 23, 1965, the 303 Committee
                        approved the purchase and manning of six additional boats.</p>
                    <p>On October 7, 1965, the 303 Committee approved a reduced contingency fund,
                        but on November 26 it approved a request for an expanded program. The
                        emergence of <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> as head of a new
                        regime was not deemed to eliminate the need for the program.</p>
                    <p>On February 5, 1966, the 303 Committee was requested to approve continued
                        covert maritime operations in the Congo, as well as covert political
                        funding. The last covert payment to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> under this program was made in September 1966, and
                        303 Committee authority to make such payments expired on December 31, 1966.
                        In compliance with a 303 Committee decision on November 4, 1966, to phase
                        out U.S. Government participation in the maritime program, control of the
                        boats was transferred to the Congolese on January 7, 1967. The project was
                        terminated effective December 31, 1967.</p>

                    <p>In telegram 20521 to Leopoldville, March 21, 1960, the Central Intelligence
                        Agency requested the Chief of Station’s views on supporting selected
                        Congolese figures during the pre-independence period. It was important, the
                        Agency believed, to “get as many lines as possible into present and
                        prospective leaders so that we not left on outside looking in while <gloss target="#t_BLOC_1">BLOC</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_ACOA_1">ACOA</gloss>,

                        attempt to “establish covert counter influences.” The Chief of Station
                        responded in telegram 518, March 25, that he agreed that the United States
                        should keep the door open but he considered support of the <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> wing of the Mouvement National

                    <p>4. On the point as to why Belgian financial interests, with much obviously at
                        stake, were not in the fray, <persName corresp="#p_FGW_1">Ferguson</persName> thought that this was in part a good example of
                        Belgian thrift in getting the other fellow to do it and that the Union
                        Miniere was probably already supporting the Conakat. The Conakat is a
                        regional party consisting of Africans and Europeans who stand for separatism
                        for the Katanga. It has been under the domination of the Union Miniere.</p>
                    <p>5. Our feeling is that there is so much at stake in preventing the placing of

                        especially becoming the Minister of the Interior (he has already taken over

                        situation.</p>
                    <pb n="8" facs="0041" xml:id="pg_8"/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">a. Brussels</p>
                    <p>We believe that it is unwise to undertake a major political action program in
                        the pre-election period. The political situation in the Congo is highly
                        fluid. We are new on the Congo political scene and, with few exceptions, do
                        not have sufficient information on which to base a judgment on who will win
                        or who merits support. However, we are not opposed to giving discreet
                        support (provided it is not attributable to the United States Government) to
                        a limited number of candidates if specific justification is provided in each
                        case. In view of the delicacy of the situation and paucity of good
                        information, we believe it is essential that the [<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>] representative consult with the senior [State]
                        representative in Leopoldville on specific cases.</p>
                    <p>Our view is that pre-election emphasis should be on establishing access to
                        and infiltration of various political groups by both normal political
                        officer contact and [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] key militants. The information obtained from both
                        these activities is a necessary basis for planning a sound investment in a
                        limited number of key political leaders.</p>
                    <p>We are opposed to any “stop <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>”
                        campaign. He is one of the few, if not only, Congolese leaders with a
                        Congo-wide appeal and standing. We feel it is almost certain that he will
                        play an important political role in the Congo for at least the next two
                        years. Thus, an anti-<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>
                        campaign could backfire. Although we consider him unscrupulous and willing
                        to accept aid from anyone if it would help him, we suggest the possibility
                        of limited funding to <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> along
                        with other selected leaders. This would provide relatively more help to
                        other leaders but would also keep the door open for future <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> contacts and perhaps avoid
                        alienating him if he learns of our support to other leaders.</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">3 names not declassified</hi>] seem more attractive than
                        many other leaders because their newspaper and trade union ties give them
                        some assurance of a continued role in Congo affairs if they fail as
                        political candidates. Also, [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]
                        may offer a line to [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]. We
                        suggest that consideration also be given to possible assistance to [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>] who is fighting against the

                        good impression. If the [<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>]
                        representative in Leopoldville agrees, this would seem a particularly good
                        case where a small investment could pay real returns in weakening an
                        existing communist beachhead in East Congo.</p>
                    <p>Whether or not it is decided to mount political operations, it is strongly

                    <p>The present political situation in the Congo is so fluid that we would be

                        single political leader or party which has a majority. After forthcoming
                        elections, it is almost inevitable that cartels and new political groups
                        will be formed for the purpose of obtaining power and planting their own men

                    <p>A. The role of <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss> in the Belgian
                        Congo during the period prior to 30 June 1960, should be to ensure that U.S.
                        aims for the area, both the Congo and the other parts of the continent whose
                        relationship with the Congo will affect our aims, can be implemented. These
                        aims are as follows:</p>
                    <p>1. The election of a government oriented to the West, friendly to the United
                        States, devoted to ideals which may best guarantee stability and order.</p>
                    <p>2. The identification, isolation and exclusion of bloc-supported,
                        bloc-oriented and Marxist groups.</p>
                    <p>B. For the accomplishment of these aims, <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss> must address itself to a number of goals as follows:</p>
                    <p>1. The tendency in the Congo is for political groupings to develop on the
                        basis of tribal connections. This has led to an extraordinary
                        fractionalization which, should it continue, can be depended upon to hinder
                        the development of a politically unified state which could provide a secure
                        base for the economic development upon which economic stability depends. In
                        this connection it would seem obvious to support a movement which could cut
                        across tribal lines and which would draw its strength from a wide geographic
                        base. [<hi rend="italic">6½ lines not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>2. No one leader has shown himself to be a disinterested statesman. Each of
                        the many party and party-fraction leaders has been utilizing his tribal
                        associations and followers for the purpose of self-aggrandizement. No one
                        seems to have evolved a political platform on the basis of ideology; the
                        only theme with any appeal on a national basis has been that of independence
                        and, since independence is a fore-gone conclusion, there remains only an
                        attempt to identify oneself with its attainment. Although some will have
                        more success than others, it is inevitable that each ethno-political entity
                        will be represented in the government-to-be. Our goal in this connection is
                        to be able to deal with <pb n="11" facs="0044" xml:id="pg_11"/>and influence
                        as many as possible of these groups. Our task will be to identify individual
                        leaders whose policies most nearly coincide with ours and offer them some
                        support. We should also attempt to identify other leaders whose views may
                            <hi rend="italic">not</hi> coincide with ours who are fairly sure of
                        some success in the forthcoming elections. Although we may not support them
                        to the same degree, we should avoid any action which will make enemies of
                        them and take some insurance for future shifts in political power. We should
                        realize that in most cases the political leaders of the Congo today have not
                        matured ideologically. Most have shown themselves willing to take help from
                        any quarter and many have been amenable to bloc blandishments and aid. In
                        our view this should not be interpreted to mean that the bloc-supported
                        groups have committed themselves ideologically either to the East or to
                        communism. Rather than consider these groups as targets for attack, we
                        should prefer to attack, where possible, the bloc sources which are
                        attempting to subvert them.<note n="2" xml:id="d5fn2">In <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> telegram 27945 to Leopoldville, May 4,

                        somewhat in past few days.</p>

                        restoring order almost without incident.</p>
                    <p>B. Belgian Forces, responding to last week’s Security Council resolution,
                        pulled back on Saturday to two Congo bases (except in Katanga Province where
                        nearly 2,000 Belgian troops helping keep order).</p>
                    <p>C. Work progressing toward restoring port facilities at Matadi, dredging
                        Congo river, and restoring vital fuel pipelines.</p>

                        having failed in secessionist move to obtain recognition as independent

                        Katanga and five other Congo provinces.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Serious problems remain and require prompt
                        action, however.</p>
                    <p>A. Foremost among these is status of Belgian bases. Agreement of 29 June 1960
                        (which not yet ratified) granted Belgium two bases at Kamina and Kitona.</p>

                    <p>1. But <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> stated to the press in
                        London on Saturday that: “It is inconceivable that foreign bases should
                        exist in a sovereign state.”</p>

                        strongly unitary state is most important to new Congo state.</p>
                    <p>1. Landlocked Katanga is richest of Congo’s six provinces and adjoins
                        Copperbelt of Northern Rhodesia to the south.</p>
                    <p>2. Katanga supplies two-thirds of total value of Congo’s mineral
                        production—all Congo’s copper (7% of world production), cobalt (60% world
                        production), manganese, zinc, cadmium, germanium and uranium. Agricultural
                        resources, however, are poor.</p>
                    <p>3. Katanga’s wealth essential to creation of viable Congo state.</p>
                    <p>4. Congo’s leaders have unanimous support of increasingly vocal African bloc
                        in opposing dismemberment of Congo.</p>
                    <p>C. Faced with loss of Belgian technicians, Congo in dire need of
                        administrative and economic cadres.</p>

                        Tunisia—seriously shorthanded in capable administrators themselves—and
                        possibly other African governments for administrators.</p>
                    <p>2. Congo leaders may resist assignment of “white technicians”; probably will
                        be influenced by other African leaders such as Ghana’s President <persName corresp="#p_NKW_1">Nkrumah</persName> who, although he retains British
                        advisors and technicians, recently declared “our campaign is to drive out
                        the white people from Africa.”</p>
                    <p>3. Inexperienced Congo leaders are “ripe to be taken to the cleaners by the
                        first carpetbagger,” according to locally stationed American official.</p>
                    <p>E. Unemployment and food shortages create immediate problems, may produce

                        one or both houses of parliament. Presently believe senate offers best
                        chance win such vote. Immediate goal would be replace present govt with more

                        would be better oust him, do not want become tied irrevocably to opposition,
                        if it not able achieve goals. Also would use such assets to try moderate
                            <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> govt and obtain
                        political intel.</p>
                    <p>5. Recognize above campaign involves large expenditures and offers no
                        guarantee success. Even if campaign successful our work only beginning as

                        organized, opposition disorganized, Station faced with problem finding,

                    <p>In telegram 0772 to the Central Intelligence Agency, August 18, 1960, the
                        Station in Leopoldville reported the following: “Embassy and Station believe
                        Congo experiencing classic Communist effort take over government. Many
                        forces at work here: Soviets, Czechs, Guineans, Ghanians, Communist Party,
                        etc. Although difficult determine major influencing factors to predict
                        outcome struggle for power, decisive period not far off. Whether or not
                            <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> actually Commie or just

                        take action to avoid another Cuba or Guinea.” The telegram then outlined a
                        proposal to assist a Congolese effort to organize opposition to Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Patrice Lumumba</persName> with the
                        aim of replacing him with a more moderate and pro-Western government. In
                        addition to propaganda efforts and coordinating the activities of youth
                        groups and trade unions, [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]. The
                        Station emphasized that the plan would go forward whether or not the United
                        States supported it, but without U.S. money and advice it might well fall
                        short of its goal and be shattered by <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>’s police state response. (Central Intelligence
                        Agency Files, Job 78–00435R, DDO/ISS Files, Box 1, Folder 3, [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] <gloss target="#t_Ops_1">Ops</gloss>) In a follow-up telegram, the Station reported that it had
                        discussed the plan in general terms with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TCH_1">Timberlake</persName>, who had expressed his
                        approval. (Telegram 0775, August 18; ibid.)</p>
                    <p>In telegram 46115, August 19, the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                        authorized the Station to proceed with the operation proposed in telegram
                        0772 provided the Ambassador still agreed. The Ambassador was also to be
                        told that <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> was informing the Department
                        of State of its authorization and would make every effort to get final
                        policy clearance to continue the operation provided the initial steps proved
                        fruitful. The Station responded in telegram 0782, August 24, that the
                        operation had been discussed again with the Ambassador, who concurred.

                    <p>On August 18, 1960, the National Security Council discussed Congolese Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>’s threats to force
                        the United Nations out of the Congo. Saying that this would be a disaster
                        the United States should do everything it could to prevent, Under Secretary
                        of State Douglas <persName corresp="#p_DCD_1">Dillon</persName> warned that
                        the Soviet Union might be invited to intervene in the Congo after the United
                        Nations was forced out. Director of Central Intelligence Allen <persName corresp="#p_DAW_1">Dulles</persName> noted that <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> was in Soviet pay. President
                            <persName corresp="#p_EDD_1">Eisenhower</persName> said that the
                        possibility that the United Nations would be forced out was simply
                        inconceivable, and declared that the United States should keep the United
                        Nations in the Congo, even if it had to ask for European troops or if such
                        action was used by the Soviets to start a fight. <persName corresp="#p_DCD_1">Dillon</persName> said that the Department of State
                        agreed, but noted that both Secretary General Hammarskjold and Ambassador
                        Lodge doubted whether the United Nations could stay if the Congolese
                        Government were opposed. For a full record of the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> discussion of the Congo, see <ref target="frus1958-60v14#d180"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi>

                    <p>On June 18, 1975, former <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> staff member
                        Robert H. <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> testified before
                        the Church Committee that during an <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>
                        meeting in the summer of 1960 President <persName corresp="#p_EDD_1">Eisenhower</persName> said something that came across to him as an
                        order for the assassination of <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>, following which there was no discussion. <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> testified that, although he could
                        no longer remember the exact words, he remembered clearly that this came as
                        a “great shock” to him. Presumably the meeting referred to was that of
                        August 18, as there were only two <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>
                        meetings that summer—August 18 and September 7—attended by both the
                        President and <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>, and the notes
                        of the September 7 meeting have no record of any Presidential comment about
                        the Congo. <persName corresp="#p_DCD_1">Dillon</persName> and <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> Acting Executive Secretary Marion Boggs
                        testified that they had no memory of any clearcut order from the President
                        for the assassination of <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>,
                        although <persName corresp="#p_DCD_1">Dillon</persName> agreed that it was
                        “perfectly possible” that <persName corresp="#p_DAW_1">Allen
                            Dulles</persName> might have translated strong Presidential language
                        about “getting rid of” <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> into
                        authorization for an assassination attempt. See <hi rend="italic">Interim
                            Report,</hi> pages 55–60, for a record of the Church Committee’s
                        investigation of whether the subsequent <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                        plot to assassinate <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> was
                        authorized by the President. In August 2000, the National Archives released
                        a memorandum recording a June 10, 1975, conversation between <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> and the director of the Church
                        Committee concerning the August 18, 1960, <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> meeting. In this memorandum, <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> recalled <persName corresp="#p_EDD_1">Eisenhower</persName> turning to <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                        Director <persName corresp="#p_DAW_1">Allen Dulles</persName> “in the full

                            <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> should be eliminated.”
                        After that <pb n="20" facs="0053" xml:id="pg_20"/>“there was a stunned
                        silence for about 15 seconds and the meeting continued.” (National Archives,

                        them “2½”) operational lines that we are following in mounting an
                            anti-<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> campaign in the
                        Congo. These included: operations through the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                            line not declassified</hi>] Christian Trade Unions; the planned attempt
                        of a [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] Senator to
                        arrange a vote of no confidence in <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>; and a brand new contact with [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] of certain independent labor
                        groups. He emphasized that the latter had just come up and that we are now
                        in the process of assessing the bona fides and capabilities of the
                        individual.</p>
                    <p>The Group agreed that the action contemplated is very much in order. Mr. Gray
                        commented, however, that his associates had expressed extremely strong
                        feelings on the necessity for very straightforward action in this situation,
                        and he wondered whether the plans as outlined were sufficient to accomplish
                        this. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW_1">Dulles</persName> replied that he had
                        taken the comments referred to seriously and had every intention of
                        proceeding as vigorously as the situation permits or requires, but added
                        that he must necessarily put himself in a position of interpreting
                        instructions of this kind within the bounds of necessity and capability. It
                        was finally agreed that planning for the Congo would not necessarily <pb n="21" facs="0054" xml:id="pg_21"/>rule out “consideration” of any
                        particular kind of activity which might contribute to getting rid of
                            <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Irwin commented that certain individuals in Defense have given thought to
                        the possibility of using high officials [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                            not declassified</hi>] to promote the general objectives of the West. In
                        this connection, he cited a preliminary assessment which had been made of
                            [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]—the
                        assessment being that the individual in question is a man of not outstanding
                        intelligence, ability or drive, but that he is obviously well motivated. Mr.
                        Irwin asked whether there might be other individuals of similar, although
                        naturally lesser, stature [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT_1">Merchant</persName> commented that [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] in Black Africa is
                        not a very substantial force. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW_1">Dulles</persName> concurred in this, but added that this would be
                        something to keep in mind as appropriate.</p>

                    <p>1. In high quarters here it is the clear-cut conclusion that if
                            [garble—<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>?] continues to
                        hold high office, the inevitable result will at best be chaos and at worst
                        pave the way to Communist takeover of the Congo with disastrous consequences
                        for the prestige of <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and for the interests
                        of the free world generally. Consequently we conclude that his removal must
                        be an urgent and prime objective and that under existing conditions this
                        should be a high priority of our covert action.<note n="2" xml:id="d14fn2">This paragraph is printed in <hi rend="italic">Interim Report</hi>, p.

                        <gloss target="#t_ODACID_1">ODACID</gloss> message. Eyes only for <persName corresp="#p_ASC_1">Ascham</persName> and for transmittal to chief <gloss target="#t_ODACID_1">ODACID</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>2. An unimpeachable source (identity) advised [Embassy] that <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> plans to oust <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> and name <persName corresp="#p_IJO_1">Joseph Ileo</persName> premier. As soon as this step
                        taken, he plans to broadcast a message to Congolese people from Radio Congo
                        requesting them to remain calm and accept the new government. Presumably he
                        also will explain his reasons for ousting <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>. Concurrently, <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> will order the Force Publique lay down its arms and
                        place itself under the order of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> plan includes following
                        steps:</p>
                    <p>A. For the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Operation Congo (<gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss>) to guarantee his personal safety with

                    <p>B. Request <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> to guard the radio station,
                        thus guaranteeing his personal safety when he speaks and insuring that
                            <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> forces will not be able
                        take control of the radio and mount a propaganda campaign in support of
                            <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>.</p>
                    <p>C. Airports Congo would be closed to all departures.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>’s plan has been
                        coordinated with <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> at highest levels
                        here. He already has taken the first step, to demand protection by <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> troops. The rest of the plan was to be
                        implemented 5 September but timing may well be changed.</p>
                    <pb n="24" facs="0057" xml:id="pg_24"/>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> suddenly left for
                        Stanleyville 5 September. Not known whether his departure motivated by
                        knowledge plan and desire escape Leopoldville and possible arrest. If so, it
                        entirely possible he plans take position in area where his popularity is
                        greatest to resist overthrow and attempt regain control of Congo. If lost,
                        using troops in Orientale, Equateur and, possibly, Kasai provinces.</p>
                    <p>6. If he unaware plan, quite possible he intends carry out attack on Katanga,
                        using troops just brought from northern Orientale to Stanleyville and Soviet
                        planes now there or arriving, which he promised during visit last week.</p>
                    <p>7. Utmost importance this be given maximum protection.<note n="3" xml:id="d15fn3">On September 5, President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> announced (on the radio) that he was dismissing

                            asked the army to lay down its weapons and called on the United Nations
                            to maintain law and order. <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> subsequently declared (also on the radio) that

                            U.N. forces proceeded to take control of the airports and radio station,
                            denying their use to both factions. Telegram 901 from Leopoldville to

                    <p>In the period immediately preceding Congo independence, <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> efforts in the Belgian Congo concentrated
                        on establishing direct contact with as many responsible political figures as
                        possible and influencing their actions. This task was made difficult by the
                        emergence of many new figures and political parties. However, by virtue of
                        having prior <pb n="25" facs="0058" xml:id="pg_25"/>contact with certain of
                        the important educated Congolese, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] a precedent had been established which facilitated
                        these efforts. In this period, as it was apparent that no one single
                        political figure or tribe was in a position effectively to lead a unified
                        Congolese state, we encouraged formation of a moderate coalition which
                        adopted a generally pro-Western posture and which rejected Congo separatism.
                        The aggressiveness of <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> and
                        the extremist political heat generated at the time prevented this coalition
                        from winning the elections. However, it did emerge as a significant
                        political force with its leader, <persName corresp="#p_IJO_1">Joseph
                            Ileo</persName>, not only becoming President of the Senate but the only
                        Congolese figure who dared publicly to challenge many of <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>’s dictatorial actions. [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>In the immediate post-independence period, <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> continued to maintain contact with the assets it had been
                        developing and to be on the lookout for new ones for whatever contingencies
                        might arise. [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>] There followed
                        the mutiny of the Force Publique and the breakdown of public order and
                        government administration. From this time on, <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> concentrated on developing contact with [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] assets who were in active
                        opposition to <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> or appeared to
                        have that potential. These were developed with the long-range view of
                        possible active use against <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>
                        and on a day to day basis in tactical opposition to increasing signs of
                        Soviet Bloc influence in the <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>
                        Government and such organs as Leopoldville Radio and the Soviet-inspired

                        been steadily reinforcing the Leopoldville station with additional personnel

                    <p><gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> has been coordinating an effort to have

                        hours of consideration had intervened, the no confidence vote would have
                        left the way clear for a successor, probably <persName corresp="#p_IJO_1">Ileo</persName> himself, to be named as Prime Minister. Preparations
                        have been in the making to support this by radio, propaganda and various
                        types of demonstrations. (An example of this was the preplanned

                        The key to the power situation in the Congo is the Force Publique, elements

                        of 5 September, Cordier has made an appeal to the Secretary General to meet
                        the Force Publique payroll with a million dollars to be paid directly by the
                        U.N. to the Force Publique. The U.N. has for the time being put the
                        Leopoldville radio station out of operation and has blocked the airfield
                        there.</p>
                    <p>On the basis of what information we have so far received it would appear that
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>’s precipitate action
                        has at least seriously jeopardized the plan for ousting <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> by constitutional means. These
                        aspects are currently being examined by our station in Leopoldville and
                            <persName corresp="#p_IJO_1">Ileo</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> are already attempting to pick up
                        the pieces. Further anti-<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>
                        demonstrations are planned. It is still possible that the plan for the
                        Senate to oust <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> may be
                        carried out but we are not yet in possession of sufficient facts to state
                        what these possibilities are.</p>

                    <p>“A. Plans refuse admit Camp Leopold Second 15 <gloss target="#t_MNC_1">MNC</gloss> political organizers assigned camp by <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>.</p>

                        well armed and could easily defeat <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and Kalonsi forces.</p>
                    <p>“D. Has ordered one company whose loyalty ‘sure’ to Leop area. Also said he
                        ordered commanding officer and chief staff Stanleyville area to Leop for
                        talks, indicating wants them under his control during crisis. (They came
                        Leop 8 September.)</p>

                    <p>“E. Several times said needed help accomplish his objective.”</p>
                    <p>At a follow-up meeting the next day <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> “explained he strongly opposed <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> but wished avoid arresting him for
                        fear starting civil war. Instead said plan was to have opposition parties
                        mount large demonstration, with police and troops arriving too late to
                        prevent people from getting <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>.” He was advised that “<gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> troops would intervene if public order disturbed by mob, but
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> refused change plan.”
                        Although it doubted the feasibility of the plan, the Station “decided to bet
                        on long shot.” More importantly, it felt <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> offered long term “political action potential,
                        provided he does not destroy himself in plot.” (Ibid.)</p>
                    <p>In concluding its report, the Station stated in part that it realized the
                        possibility of provocation of the political action program in support of
                        moderate anti-<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> leaders and
                        the risk opposition may not achieve its objective. The Station stated:
                        “believe <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss> should support this long
                        shot operation. <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> victory,
                        which quite possible, would mean, at least for near future, govt hostile to
                            <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> interests.” The Station
                        reported it was continuing press the operation even though it realized that
                            [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] bungling of the coup and
                        lack guts and imagination of most opposition leaders had greatly limited the
                        chances the operation would succeed. (Ibid.)</p>
                    <p>In a radio interview 37 years later, the Chief of Station said that at the
                        Presidential Palace <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> told him
                        of his plans to mount a coup and asked whether the U.S. Government would
                        support him. The Chief of Station recalled that after finessing for some
                        time he finally had said, “I believe we will.” (“The Connection,” WBUR,
                        Boston, Massachusetts, March 27, 1997) In his 1967 debriefing, the Chief of
                        Station gave a somewhat different version of this meeting, saying that
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> had complained about
                        Soviet penetration of the army and asked him what he should do. The Chief of
                        Station remembers telling him that, as a junior officer, he could not set
                        policy. Finally <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> said that he
                        would not act unless the Chief of Station told him that the U.S. Government
                        would back him. The Chief of Station responded that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> should prevent at any cost the
                        Soviets taking over the army. Arrangements were then made to provide funds.
                        The Chief of Station said that this was the beginning of the plan for
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> to take over the
                        government. (16 August 1967 and 20 September 1967 Debriefing: Chief of

                    <p>I. Confusion surrounds coup attempted by army commander <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Joseph Mobutu</persName>.</p>
                    <p>A. Latest press report is that <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> followers claiming <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> arrested and he still in control.</p>
                    <p>B. However, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> told newsmen early
                        on 15 September that both <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>
                        and <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> were under guard in
                        their homes in Leopoldville.</p>
                    <p>C. We also have report from official in Leopoldville airport tower that
                            <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> departed for
                        Stanleyville yesterday.</p>
                    <p>D. If he has indeed gone to Stanleyville, it is probably to organize civil
                        war against <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>.</p>
                    <p>II. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s coup appears intended to

                    <p>B. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> announced cooperation with
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, and ordered Soviet and Czech

                        to turn him down. Director of Central Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_DAW_1">Dulles</persName> warned that although <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> appeared to be the effective power
                        in the Congo for the moment, <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>
                        was not yet disposed of and remained a grave danger as long as he was not

                        visas, but delayed issuance at Station request.” With the Ambassador’s
                        approval, the Chief of Station alerted [<hi rend="italic">name not

                        thus preventing his departure. [<hi rend="italic">text not

                        briefly outlined seven “possibilities,” the first of which involved having
                        an agent “take refuge with big brother [<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>]. Would thus act as inside man to brush up details
                        to razor edge. Also would provide info on food and agricultural problem.”
                        The second possibility involved an unidentified individual who “said he
                        planned action within 8 days. Date passed and no action but if price right
                        might get show on road.” The Chief of Station indicated to <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> that he planned to proceed “on basis

                            <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>) was concerned, their
                        primary concern must be concealment of the U.S. role, unless an outstanding
                        opportunity emerged which made a calculated risk a first class bet.
                        Headquarters was ready to entertain any serious proposals the Station made.
                        (Ibid.)</p>
                    <p>On August 21, 1975, the Chief of Station testified before the Church
                        Committee that Scheider had told him that his instructions were to
                        “eliminate” <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>, and that he had
                        received “rubber gloves, a mask and a syringe” along with lethal biological
                        materials from Scheider, who also instructed him in their use. (Scheider
                        testified on October 7, 1975, that the toxic material was to be injected
                        into some substance that <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>
                        would ingest, i.e., food or a toothbrush, so that some of it would get into
                        his mouth.) The means of assassination had not been restricted to use of
                        this toxic material, but the Chief of Station emphasized that although
                        selection of a mode of assassination was left to his judgment, it had been
                        essential that it be carried out in a way that could not be traced back
                        either to an American or the U.S. Government. He also recalled he had
                        reacted with great surprise when he realized that Scheider had come to
                        discuss an assassination plan, and said that Scheider had indicated this had
                        been authorized by the President. Both Scheider and the Chief of Station
                        confirmed to the Church Committee that the top priority possibility listed
                        in telegram 0026 involved instructing an agent to infiltrate <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>’s entourage to explore means of
                        poisoning him. (<hi rend="italic">Interim Report,</hi> pages. 24–27)</p>

                        Station in Leopoldville reported on a meeting with Colonel <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Joseph Mobutu</persName> the previous day during
                        which he stated that he was under tremendous pressure from numerous
                        “diplomats” to support President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>, but maintained that, in view of his announced
                        policy of neutralism, he could not show favoritism. He added that he was so
                        fed up that he was ready to throw in the sponge, reopen parliament, and let
                        the politicians fight it out themselves. The Station expressed its great
                        concern at the possibility that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> might carry out his threat and withdraw the army from
                        the conflict, since the field would then be wide open for <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>’s return to power. In a second
                        meeting later the same day, reported in telegram 0058, October 2, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> appeared more calm and promised to

                        additional financial aid with the comment that “<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> got everything he needed from Communists, whereas I
                        get practically no help at all.” (Central Intelligence Agency Files, Job

                    <p>The Central Intelligence Agency informed the Station in telegram 04697,
                        October 6, that in view of the uncertain outcome of current developments it
                        was conducting contingency planning for the Congo at the request of “policy
                        echelons.” The planning was designed to prepare for a situation in which the
                        United States would provide clandestine support for elements in the armed
                        opposition to <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>. Although

                    <p>In telegram 0089, October 8, the Station in Leopoldville informed the Central

                        Committee in October 1975 that he had “destroyed the viability” of the
                        biological material and disposed of it in the Congo River before departing

                    <p>On November 3, 1960, a Central Intelligence Agency senior case officer,
                        called Michael Mulroney in <hi rend="italic">Interim Report</hi>, arrived in
                        Leopoldville. In June 1975 Mulroney testified to the Church Committee that
                        he had been asked by <persName corresp="#p_BRM_1">Richard
                        Bissell</persName>, Deputy Director of Plans, to go to the Congo to carry

                            Lumumba</persName>. Mulroney told the committee that before leaving for
                        Leopoldville he had met with Scheider, who discussed with him lethal means
                        for disposing of <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>, including
                        a virus and poison, but Mulroney informed <persName corresp="#p_BRM_1">Bissell</persName> he would not participate in an assassination plot.
                        Mulroney testified, however, that while in Leopoldville he had been prepared
                        to take action to “neutralize” <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> by drawing him away from <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> custody and turning him over to the legal Congolese
                        authorities, Mulroney told the committee that he was opposed to
                        assassination but not “capital punishment.” For more information on

                    <p>Responding to rumors that President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> was thinking of replacing or curtailing the
                        authority of Colonel <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, on
                        October 7, 1960, the Central Intelligence Agency asked the Station in
                        Leopoldville to inform the Ambassador that the Department of State’s
                        reaction, which the Agency shared, was to attempt to persuade <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> not to replace <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, since obvious legal chaos would
                        follow. (Telegram 04785; Central Intelligence Agency Files, Job 78–00435R,
                        DDO/ISS Files, Box 1, Folder 4, [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not

                        0092 to the Central Intelligence Agency, October 8, the Station noted that
                        the rumors had come from many sources and in each case it had reacted
                        strongly, pointing out the facts of political life and indicating that such
                            <pb n="43" facs="0076" xml:id="pg_43"/>action would torpedo the [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] effort in support of
                        moderate anti-<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> leaders. The
                        Station also reported that, in response to telegram 04785, meetings had been
                        held with the Ambassador and with Georges Denis, <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>’s Belgian advisor, who admitted
                        there had been some talk recently in <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> circles of removing or reducing <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s authority but insisted such
                        action was no longer under consideration. Denis agreed such action could be
                        most dangerous and he would do his best to convince <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> of that fact. (Ibid.)</p>
                    <p>The Station also informed the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> in
                        telegram 0092 that there was a report that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> had told the College of Commissioners the previous
                        evening that he agreed to the arrest of <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Patrice
                            Lumumba</persName>. Three days later, on October 11, the Station
                        reported in telegram 0107 that the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                        Secretary-General’s Special Representative in the Congo, <persName corresp="#p_DRA_1">Rajeshwar Dayal</persName>, had four times refused to
                        allow Congolese authorities to serve an arrest warrant on <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>, stating that the arrest was just
                        a trick to assassinate <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>.
                        Bomoboko had told the Embassy that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> was prepared to attack <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> guards if necessary to take <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>. The Station noted that although it had consistently
                        urged [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] leaders to arrest
                            <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>, the Embassy and Station
                        had been trying to prevent a <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                        attack, fearing that it would not succeed and would jeopardize the position
                        of the moderate [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] leaders.
                        (Ibid.)</p>
                    <p>On October 13, <persName corresp="#p_DAW_1">Allen Dulles</persName> informed
                        the National Security Council that the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                        position was that it would surrender <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> only if his parliamentary immunity were lifted by
                        the Congolese Parliament, and there was some talk of convening Parliament to
                        get his immunity withdrawn. He said that there were a thousand Congolese
                        troops around <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>’s house, while
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> guard force was not nearly so strong.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD_1">Dillon</persName> noted that conflict
                        between <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and Congolese forces would create
                        a very bad situation, and said the U.S. Government had suggested that

                    <p>In telegram 0162 to the Central Intelligence Agency, October 22, 1960, the
                        Station in Leopoldville reported that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Joseph
                            Mobutu</persName> was considering another coup with the objective of a
                        full takeover of the government and the neutralization indefinitely of
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Joseph Kasavubu</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Patrice Lumumba</persName>. However, both
                        the Station and the Ambassador believed such a move would fail and would
                        lead to failure of the program to support moderate anti-<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> leaders. Seeking a solution that
                        would be acceptable to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> as
                        well as to other moderate leaders and public opinion yet would coincide with
                        U.S. policy, the Station proposed a program, with the concurrence of the
                        Ambassador, based on <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s
                        remaining in the background as the strong man. (Central Intelligence Agency
                        Files, Job 78–00435R, DDO/ISS Files, Box 1, Folder 4, [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] <gloss target="#t_Ops_1">Ops</gloss>)</p>
                    <p>Immediately upon receiving telegram 0162 the Agency discussed the proposal
                        with the Department of State at the bureau level and reported back in
                        telegram 07606, October 22, that the initial reaction was <pb n="47" facs="0080" xml:id="pg_47"/>not at all unfavorable but since it involved
                        basic U.S. policy toward the Congo it would require clearance at least by
                        the Secretary of State. (Ibid.) In an October 24 memorandum <persName corresp="#p_TBR_1">Bronson Tweedy</persName> submitted the proposal to
                            <persName corresp="#p_SJC_1">Joseph Satterthwaite</persName>, Assistant
                        Secretary of State for African Affairs, and requested his approval to
                        discuss it with <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>. (Ibid., Job
                        76–00366R, DDO/ISO Files, Box 1, Folder 7, Congo, 1960–1969, Part 1)</p>
                    <p>In telegram 0192 from Leopoldville to <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>,
                        October 26, the Station reported that the anti-<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> leaders, believing they commanded a parliamentary
                        majority, were organizing a new government, and <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> planned to open parliament by the end of the month.
                        The Embassy, however, was convinced that the anti-<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> leaders did not have a majority.
                        Thus, it was urgent that the Station obtain approval of the proposal in
                        Leopoldville 0162 along with authority to make tactical changes and work
                        through others if <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> was not
                        willing to play the part outlined for him. The anti-<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> leaders were all anxious to return
                        to power. The Department of State must realize that the Embassy and Station
                        were not able to control events, the telegram stressed, and if they did not
                        have a program such as that proposed, they could not even influence the
                        outcome of events. Even with a program it was not certain they could control
                        events but they would have a much better chance of achieving their
                        objectives. If the anti-<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>
                        leaders opened parliament and failed to get a majority, pressures for
                            <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>’s return would be almost
                        irresistible. (Ibid., Job 78–00435R, DDO/ISS Files, Box 1, Folder 4, [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] <gloss target="#t_Ops_1">Ops</gloss>)</p>
                    <p>The proposed program was considered by the Special Group at its meeting on
                        October 27. See <ref target="#d37">Documents 37</ref> and <ref target="#d38">38</ref>.</p>

                            (<gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss>), in order to prevent <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> from regaining control of the

                    <p>It is assumed that it is in our interest to support Colonel <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> as a counterbalance to <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> and encourage him to work towards
                        the eventual formation of a moderate civilian government in the Congo.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. <hi rend="italic">Facts and Discussion</hi>:</p>
                    <p>It is reliably reported that Colonel <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> is considering another coup in the Congo with the
                        objective of a full take-over of the government. Although full details of
                        his plan are not available, it is presumed he would act as Chief of State
                        and might try to assume that title. Our representatives in Leopoldville
                        believe that such a move would fail and lead to a general collapse of
                        current operations designed to build up a moderate political opposition to
                            <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>. It is considered that
                        Colonel <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> does not have
                        sufficient administrative or political ability to run the government and
                        that he lacks political following. A review of other political personalities
                        in the Congo indicates that none of them appear to meet the absolute
                        standards required for leadership at this time. An attempt has therefore
                        been made to develop a course of action that might be acceptable to Colonel
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, to the Congolese, and
                        world opinion.</p>
                    <p>Colonel <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> had advised he planned
                        to fly to New York to make a direct personal appeal to the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Secretary General for support of his
                        government. He stated that he intended to expose a plot against him by
                        Ghana, Guinea, the <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss>, Morocco, and India,
                        through their <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> representatives and
                        contingents in the Congo, and that he would insist on immediate withdrawal
                        of military units of those countries. This trip has now apparently been
                        postponed indefinitely.</p>
                    <p>In spite of Colonel <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s claims
                        to the loyalty of the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss>, it is not clear
                        the extent to which certain elements may still be favorable to <pb n="50" facs="0083" xml:id="pg_50"/><persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>. There is also a resurgence of political activity by
                            <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>’s supporters which tends
                        to weaken Colonel <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s
                        position.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. <hi rend="italic">Conclusions</hi>:</p>
                    <p>It is concluded that action is advisable at this time to strengthen Colonel
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s position in an effort
                        to prevent the Communist-oriented <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> government from regaining control of the Congo. It
                        is also concluded that assistance provided to Colonel <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> should be of such a nature as to
                        encourage the establishment of a moderate civilian government.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">5. <hi rend="italic">Action Recommended</hi>:</p>
                    <p>It is recommended that authorization be granted to undertake the following
                        steps to bring about a de facto government of the Congo under Colonel
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s leadership, with
                        parliamentary support and participation of leading moderate political
                        elements.</p>
                    <p>a. It is proposed to approach Colonel <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> to convince him of the advantages of remaining in the
                        position of a “strong man” behind the government avoiding an overt role. He
                        would be assured of adequate funds to maintain control over troops in the
                        Leopoldville area and expand his authority in the provinces. It is also
                        proposed to offer a personal subsidy to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> further to insure his continued cooperation.</p>
                    <p>b. If this proposal is acceptable in principle, a ministerial list would be
                        submitted to Colonel <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> asking
                        him for his suggestions and possible changes. Our Leopoldville
                        representatives are currently preparing such a list.</p>
                    <p>c. Once a ministerial list is accepted, Colonel <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> would be asked to meet with the principal political
                        leaders in opposition to <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> and
                        indicate to them that they cannot obtain office without his support, and
                        that he needs their help to run the government. He would then suggest the
                        formation of a small inner council, [<hi rend="italic">1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] to be used as the mechanism to organize support in
                        parliament [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]. In
                        this connection it is proposed to maintain direct subsidies to certain major
                        political leaders to provide an additional element of control.</p>
                    <p>d. As a next step Colonel <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s
                        political inner council would call in parliamentarians one at a time, or in
                        small groups, to discuss the political situation and induce them to sign a
                        petition in support of Colonel <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s government program. All possible pressure to
                        cooperate would be put on these individuals during these discussions.</p>
                    <p>e. If these steps should succeed, parliament would be convened to obtain a
                        confidence vote in a new government. A vote then would be <pb n="51" facs="0084" xml:id="pg_51"/>proposed to lift parliamentary immunity from
                            <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> and his more dangerous
                        supporters and collaborators. Finally, a parliamentary vote would be
                        proposed to give the government full powers for an extended period to meet
                        the economic crisis.</p>
                    <p>It is estimated that funds required to implement these recommendations will
                        amount to approximately [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                            declassified</hi>] during the period up to 31 December 1960.
                        Approximately [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] would
                        be required for payments to elements of the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss>, the balance being used to obtain parliamentary support for
                        Colonel <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s government.
                        Adequate funds are currently available in our budget for expenditures of
                        this magnitude. However, if the cost of this program runs higher than these
                        figures during this period, or the program needs to be continued over a
                        longer period, it may be necessary to request additional funds [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>].</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT_1">Merchant</persName> questioned the intent
                        toward <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PTA_1">Parrott</persName> replied that the program envisages

                        the legitimate head of state and that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> would remain in the background. With this

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT_1">Merchant</persName> went on to explain that
                        Department representatives had had two discussions with Hammarskjold and
                        that the trend in the latter’s thinking has been somewhat disturbing. He has
                        swung away from a feeling that <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> must be removed, to a feeling that he is the
                        legitimate prime minister and we must live with him, although acknowledging
                        that his title is somewhat clouded. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT_1">Merchant</persName> said that a telegram has been dispatched to

                        will lose its primary weapon, [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] will become just another anti-[<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>] leader (and one with little

                        and/or [<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>] return power. In
                        short, [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s] control <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> absolutely essential [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]. <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> control army would play into hands [<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>] forces.

                        advantages for Bloc. Despite reports by limited number journalists Leop,
                        neither Station nor Embassy have reason believe [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s] power waning in army. Also we
                        discount exaggerated stories re <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss>
                        terrorist activities. There were incidents but some journalists exaggerated
                        them out of all proportions.</p>
                    <p>B. Agree political realities require some form constitutionality for new
                        govt. However if we to be realistic, must be satisfied with democratic
                        facade as, with possible exception Nigeria, there no real democracy in
                        Africa and Congolese are less prepared than most Africans for true
                        democracy. We have alternatives between [<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>] dictatorship which would be anti-Western and
                        pro-Western coalition which would try give Congo stable if not fully
                        democratic govt.</p>
                    <p>C. Agree parliament meeting must be “full” (that is include Katanga
                        deputies). Although recognize political difficulties <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> which would result if [<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>] prevented from attending parliament, his presence
                        parliament will endanger our program. He is a convincing demogogue. <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> protection parliament meeting will remove
                        lever Station planned use. Had planned place <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> around parliament building in effort convince hesitant
                        deputies it not healthy support [<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>]. However placing <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                        troops around parliament building is not solution to intimidation problem.
                        Many anti-[<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>] deputies afraid
                        come Leop or afraid take open stand against [<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>]. As they fear <gloss target="#t_MNC_1">MNC</gloss>
                        and <gloss target="#t_PSA_1">PSA</gloss> goon squads, attacks on families in

                    <p>4. Station greatly concerned by maneuvering within <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> of nations supporting [<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>] and apparent cooperation if not actual connivance
                        of <persName corresp="#p_DRA_1">Dayal</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_RBG_1">Rikhye</persName> and other <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> personnel. They have made no secret of their dislike and

                        force open parliament with <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> troops. Such
                        action in near future would probably return [<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>] to power. Also a compromise which weakened [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>]<note n="6" xml:id="d40fn6">See footnote 3.</note> forces would definitely undermine
                        Station relations with [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>].</p>
                    <p>5. If <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> continues permit tail to wag
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> dog, Station believes we will soon
                        find [<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>] back in saddle, Bloc

                        short, Station believes <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> must take
                        stronger <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> position, even at risk temporary

                    <p>To prevent a Communist-oriented government from gaining control of the

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">2.</hi> Assumptions:</p>
                    <p>It is assumed that <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>, with
                        Communist support, will make every effort to regain control of the Congo and
                        will, if possible, employ force against his political opponents to achieve
                        this end.</p>
                    <p>In the event that <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> regains
                        control of the Congolese National Army (<gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss>), or obtains paramilitary support from tribal elements, there
                        will be open resistance by opposition political elements to his attempt to
                        establish control.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">3.</hi> Facts and Discussion:</p>
                    <p>At present Colonel <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> commander, is in de facto control of the
                        Congolese government. He has established a group of general commissioners to
                        run the country pending the eventual formation of a moderate civilian
                        government.</p>
                    <p>An unpredictable factor in the situation is the extent to which <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> can retain control of the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> and utilize it as a force to check
                            <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>. There is also the
                        possibility that <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>, with
                        support by Ghana, Guinea, the <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss>, and the
                        Communist bloc, will be able to raise forces to attempt an open seizure of
                        power.</p>
                    <p>If there is a split in the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss>, or a
                        weakening in <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s position
                        combined with a resurgence of <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> forces, it may be possible to prevent Communist
                        consolidation of power by providing paramilitary support to anti-Communist
                        opposition elements. Our contingency planning is directed toward this
                        end.</p>
                    <p>Under these conditions, selected opposition elements would be provided with
                        support consisting of arms, ammunition, sabotage materials and training. The
                        establishment of a controlled clandestine radio is also envisaged.</p>

                        of building so that he can participate in inflamatory political meetings.
                        Ghanians on other hand, according to [<hi rend="italic">name not

                        activity since leaders feel that his popularity is sagging. Approach was
                        made to Ghanians for help in breakout but this refused for reason given

                    <p>On the night of November 27, 1960, <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Patrice
                            Lumumba</persName>, who had been confined to his house since early
                        October, slipped past the United Nations and Congolese National Army troops
                        guarding his residence and set out for Stanleyville, where Antoine Gizenga
                        was regrouping <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>’s supporters.
                        On November 28, the Chief of Station cabled the Central Intelligence Agency
                        that the Station was working with the Congolese Government “to get roads
                        blocked and troops alerted possible escape route.” (<hi rend="italic">Interim Report,</hi> page 48) The former prime minister was captured in
                        Kasai Province around midnight on December 1 by Congolese National Army
                        troops. On December 2 he was flown to Leopoldville; the next day he was
                        imprisoned at Thysville.</p>
                    <p>In 1975 the Church Committee looked into the question of whether the Central
                        Intelligence Agency had played any role in either <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>’s escape or his recapture. A
                        senior case officer called Michael Mulroney in the Church Committee’s <hi rend="italic">Interim Report</hi>, who was in Leopoldville at the time
                        of <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>’s escape, testified that
                        he had been prepared to “neutralize” <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> by drawing him away from <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> custody and turning him over to the legal Congolese
                        authorities, but he denied any responsibility for <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>’s escape or his subsequent
                        recapture. He testified in addition that a <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> operative QJWIN (see <ref target="#d46">Document 46</ref>
                        and <ref target="#d46fn5">footnote 5</ref> thereto), who arrived in
                        Leopoldville on November 21 and worked for Mulroney, also bore no
                        responsibility. The Chief of Station at the time testified that he was
                        “quite certain that there was no Agency involvement in any way” in <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>’s escape and that he had no
                        advance knowledge of <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>’s
                        plans. The Chief of Station said he consulted with Congolese authorities
                        about possible routes <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> might
                        take to Stanleyville, but he was “not a major assistance” in tracking him
                        down prior to his capture. (<hi rend="italic">Interim Report,</hi> pages

                    <p>In its 988-page report released in 2001 following a parliamentary inquiry
                        into the assassination of <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Patrice
                            Lumumba</persName>, a Belgian parliamentary committee reported that
                        telegrams in Belgian Government files, sent to Brussels by way of the
                        embassy in Brazzaville, did not appear to support as modest a role in the
                        recapture of <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> as claimed by
                        officials in their testimony before the Church Committee. The parliamentary
                        committee verified that Belgian advisers at Leopoldville participated
                        actively in the hunt for <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>,
                        and, the committee indicated, “indirectly, we can equally confirm that the

                        important role than the Church Committee report, presented in 1975 by the

                            (pp. 44–45) In June 1975, a <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> senior

                            come to the Congo to work with him on counter-espionage. Mulroney
                            declared, however, that neither he nor QJWIN was responsible for

Characterized <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> as in “disturbed personal condition.” [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] says <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> blamed his remaining on so long in
                        Leopoldville on Afro-Asians. Most of his followers have also fled.</p>
                    <p>B. Unconfirmed press reports suggest <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> is moving overland to Stanleyville.</p>
                    <p>II. Orientale Province controlled by <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> forces since mid-October, despite some opposition
                        from army elements loyal to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>.</p>
                    <pb n="63" facs="0096" xml:id="pg_63"/>
                    <p>A. <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>, describing situation
                        Orientale, recently observed that “liberation movement in Congo could be
                        launched from there.” Probably hopes to consolidate position there, then
                        build up his following in other areas.</p>
                    <p>B. <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> agents, the <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss>, and Soviet Bloc continue active in
                        support of this goal.</p>
                    <p>1. On 26 November, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]
                        that <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>’s operations in
                        Stanleyville should be encouraged, “and similar movements started in Kasai,
                        North Katanga and Kivu.”</p>
                    <p>2. In mid-November, <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> emissary
                        contacted [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]
                        concerning delivery of unidentified shipment which was to transit <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss> and Sudan, presumably to Orientale
                        Province.</p>
                    <p>III. On 28 November, <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>
                        partisans in Stanleyville launched sweeping arrests of Europeans, including
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> personnel. Most released, but many
                        beaten. <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> representative Stanleyville asked
                        for emergency air evacuation of 1,000 Europeans on 29 November, but request
                        dropped on 30 November with <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> reporting
                        Stanleyville “quiet.”</p>
                    <p>A. Also on 28 November Congolese district commissioner in Stanleyville
                        instructed all police posts Orientale Province that any European expressing
                            anti-<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> sentiments would be
                        expelled.</p>
                    <p>IV. Should <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> arrive safely
                        Stanleyville, where his followers so well established, new phase of power
                        struggle in Congo would begin.</p>
                    <p>A. According to one report, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s
                        commissioners decided 29 November to mount military operations against
                            <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> forces at Stanleyville.
                        This would be most difficult. If <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> unable
                        prevent such action, result would be civil war.</p>

                        him if it not possible in near future establish legal govt replace college
                        of commissioners and asked about [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] statement he plans retain commissioners as interim
                        govt after 1 Jan. [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] expressed
                        contempt for majority political leaders, noting they did little to oppose
                            [<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>] when going was rough
                        and that now [<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>] out of way
                        they want reap benefits of his work. Expressed view most want benefits of
                        office but few are willing accept responsibilities. Although [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] could not but concur, he pointed out need
                        to form legal government in near future to satisfy world opinion and to
                        obtain backing of political leaders. After much talk, [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] agreed to compromise suggested by
                            [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] ([<hi rend="italic">less than 1

                        political leaders can guarantee majority parliamentarians will be present
                        and majority will support government satisfactory to [<hi rend="italic">less

                        secretaries of state.) As new govt must be acceptable to [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>], [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] raised possibility of [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] as premier. [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] reacted favorably but [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] did not try push point other than noting that [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] good man and now trying line

                    <p>6. [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] reported above to Ambassador 7 Dec
                        and obtained latter’s okay to try organize new coalition govt. Ambassador
                        agreed help and will see [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity

However, [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] called [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] morning 9 Dec saying he “most disappointed” statements by

                        criticizing his efforts govern Congo. [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] was very angry. Said he plans call meeting Leop of
                        all <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> senior officers, to offer his
                        resignation as chief of staff to <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and let latter try find someone who able control

                        morning. However, [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] did not
                        call and although [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] tried reach him
                        many times no contact made. Will continue try see him soonest, as fear
                        statements by [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 3</persName>] and
                        Delvaux may upset [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s]

                        resort to another coup. Trying best to avoid this. Also will try convince

                        achieve interim solution government situation here to obtain legal facade

                        but we trying. <gloss target="#t_ODACID_1">ODACID</gloss> appears believe we

                        persons with some understanding <pb n="65" facs="0098" xml:id="pg_65"/>niceties parliamentary system. This not the case. [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] leaders [<hi rend="italic">1 line not

                        formation govt which would not be able obtain parliamentary majority when
                        parliament finally opened. Alternative danger might be angry [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] going for broke with another
                        coup.</p>
                    <p>8. View political nature this operation, Station working closely with
                        Ambassador and coordinating every step. We trying move as fast as possible
                        and to implement <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> policy but
                        Station does not believe it advisable risk stirring up intramural [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] fight to try accomplish
                        in week what we hope can be done in one month. We have come long way [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] when one considers

                    <p>In telegram 0478 to the Central Intelligence Agency, December 17, 1960, the

                        Division, Senate Select Committee, Volume II) In its December 17 telegram,
                        the Station reported that WIROGUE had offered QJWIN, a <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> agent then in Leopoldville, “three hundred
                        dollars per month to participate in intel net and be member ‘execution
                        squad.’” QJWIN responded that he was not interested. The Station commented
                        that it was “concerned by WIROGUE free wheeling and lack security. Station
                        has enough headaches without worrying about agent who not able handle
                        finances and who not willing follow instructions. If Hqs desires, willing

                        recall best solution.”</p>
                    <p>In 1975 the Church Committee investigated the possibility that WIROGUE’s
                        reference to an “execution squad” was connected to the assassination of
                            <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Patrice Lumumba</persName>, but the
                        committee was unable to substantiate such a connection. A March 14, 1975,
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> memorandum for the record
                        (responding to the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> Inspector General’s
                        request for information on WIROGUE) stated that a search of available
                        documents did not clarify the matter to any great extent. (Ibid., Job
                        80B00910A, Box 18, Folder 11, Homicides—<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba, Patrice</persName>, Tab 6)</p>
                    <p>In a memorandum for the record dated June 20, 1975, another <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> official stated that he had briefed
                        WIROGUE prior to his dispatch to Leopoldville, where WlROGUE was to be
                        available to the Station for paramilitary activities. The official noted
                        that WlROGUE had not followed instructions and had become a handling
                        problem; eventually he had been returned to the United States. The official
                        stated that neither WIROGUE nor QJWIN was in any way involved in <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>’s arrest and subsequent
                        assassination. (Ibid., Tab 4) For official testimony concerning WIROGUE and

                    <p>I. Efforts by Gizenga’s dissident regime in Stanleyville to secure foreign
                        aid may result in greater Bloc or African intervention in the already
                        explosive situation.</p>
                    <p>A. The <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss> presently providing material
                        assistance through its <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> battalion in

                    <p>B. <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is probably also preparing to

                        is making preparations now, and we are making preparations too.”</p>
                    <p>C. Although Sudan on 15 December advised [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                            not declassified</hi>] that it could not permit transshipping of
                        supplies to dissidents through Sudan, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line

                        chance” this position will be reversed.</p>
                    <p>II. Pro-<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> African countries,
                        though vague as to how to return <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> to power, are now thinking in terms of a joint
                        military command independent of <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> to
                        support dissidents. Such a command apparently would consist of military
                        contingents “withdrawn” from <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> command but
                        not from Congo.</p>
                    <p>A. Morocco reportedly plans to delay pullout of its <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> contingent until a decision is reached among African states
                        concerning means of aiding dissidents.</p>
                    <p>B. Similarly, the <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss> has made no move to
                        carry out withdrawal of its <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                        contingent.</p>
                    <p>C. Hammarskjold has appealed to nations threatening withdrawal to reconsider
                        their decision.</p>
                    <p>III. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, meanwhile, is
                        considering military moves against dissidents.</p>
                    <p>A. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, under pressure from
                        commissioners to move against dissidents, held council of war with
                        subordinate commanders 14–15 December.</p>
                    <p>B. Congo Army units loyal to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                        scattered throughout Orientale and Equateur provinces evidently outnumber
                        Gizenga’s dissident forces.</p>

                    <p>C. <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> official in Leopoldville has stated
                        that Gizenga and followers are doubtful of their ability to repel attack by
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, and have made plans to
                        flee in case of attack.</p>
                    <p>IV. The <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> command in Leopoldville,
                        threatened with departure of perhaps third of its 20,000-man force,
                        maintains an anti-<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                        posture.</p>

                        up <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>.”</p>
                    <p>B. Sporadic tribal warfare in northern Katanga not yet controlled by <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> forces.</p>
                    <p>V. Various Congolese political factions continue to work at cross
                        purposes.</p>
                    <p>A. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, who earlier indicated he
                        would extend his interim government indefinitely, reportedly is now willing
                        to reconvene parliament in January. Has stated, however, that he will allow
                        restoration of civil government only if its composition to his liking.</p>
                    <p>B. <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> reportedly plans to call
                        round table conference of Congolese parties in late December. He desires
                        restoration of powers to the <persName corresp="#p_IJO_1">Ileo</persName>
                        cabinet, and admits to being at odds with <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, who desires to continue commissioners in office
                        under some guise.</p>
                    <p>VI. We have just received an unconfirmed report that <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> had died in prison. I am taking
                        this with a grain of salt until we have confirmation.</p>

                            December 29, the Station in Leopoldville reported that it had been
                            unable to obtain hard intelligence on the Congolese Government’s plans
                            to mount a military operation against Stanleyville. (On December 12,
                            Antoine Gizenga had declared an independent Free Republic of the Congo
                            with Stanleyville as its capital.) Congo Sûreté member [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] said that the details were
                            still not firm, but that the Belgian Government had agreed to support
                            such an operation. He and <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> warned that a Stanleyville operation could not
                            be mounted unless U.S. funds were forthcoming. The cable stressed that
                            the Station and Ambassador believed it was urgent that the United States
                            support the Congolese Government in mounting an operation against
                            Stanleyville, and recommended that the Chief of Station be authorized to
                            advise <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> that he had been authorized
                            “in principle” to provide aid. (Ibid.)</note></p>
                    <p>1. We have been discussing ref recommendations with State at African bureau
                        level and will be discussing further at Undersecretary level at 1100 local
                        time 31 December. In discussion with <persName corresp="#p_PJK_1">Penfield</persName>, latter brought up recent embtels from Ambassador
                        which have emphasized political settlement rather than military action. As
                        result has asked following be passed Ambassador from him:</p>
                    <p>“We are having some difficulty reconciling your recommendations re
                        encouragement and assistance to military campaign against Gizenga with your
                        apparent reliance on political settlement as reflected your recent reporting

                        here one would appear prejudicial to the other. Our principal hesitations re
                        military action are (1) possibility <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> forces would find themselves in situation where
                        conflict with <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> forces unavoidable, thus
                        forcing <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> in effect fight on Gizenga’s side
                        and (2) Belgian involvement could turn entire Afro Asian world violently
                        against <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>. Please comment urgently.”</p>

                    <p>2. A reply prior our meeting tomorrow would obviously be most helpful.<note n="4" xml:id="d52fn4">Telegram 0564 from Leopoldville to <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, December 31, transmitted Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_TCH_1">Timberlake</persName>’s reply, which
                            stated that military action would be a show of force to support efforts
                            toward a political settlement. He recognized the possibility of a clash
                            between <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s forces and
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> forces, but believed the
                            likelihood of such a clash was slight unless the United Nations ordered
                            them to intervene. The Ambassador also believed that Belgium intended to
                            exercise maximum discretion in providing support. Therefore, he believed
                            that this operation should be supported as suggested. (Central

                        alternative. If the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> refuses to heed
                            <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> pay demands [<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>] and [Department of State] representatives
                        in Leopoldville believe the present government may fall within a few days.
                        The result would almost certainly be chaos and the return of <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> to power.<note n="3" xml:id="d55fn3">Quoted in <hi rend="italic">Interim Report,</hi> p.
                            49.</note> The second alternative would be for the <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> to disarm the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss>. That step might lead to fighting between <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                        troops, which would play into the hands of the Gizenga regime. Also, if the
                        troops were disarmed, <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> would
                        probably return to power. <persName corresp="#p_DRA_1">Dayal</persName> and
                        other <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> leaders have directly or indirectly
                        supported <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> to such an extent
                        that [<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>] and [Department of State] have
                        little doubt that they would avail themselves of this opportunity to
                        encourage the return of <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> to
                        the government. For example, if the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss>
                        were disarmed and the <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> opened
                        parliament, the combination of <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>’s powers as a demagogue, his able use of goon squads
                        and propaganda, and the spirit of defeat within the <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> coalition which would increase rapidly under such
                        conditions would almost certainly insure a <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> victory in the parliament. In short, [<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>] and [Department of State] believe the US
                        Government faces a difficult choice. Neither alternative is good, but
                        refusal to take drastic steps at this time will lead to defeat of US policy
                        in the Congo. On the other hand, immediate steps to guarantee troop loyalty
                        by increasing salaries through a combat bonus would give the US a breathing
                        spell during which time we might aid <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]
                        and others to meet the problem of the Gizenga regime and to instill
                        discipline in the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>3. In view of the above, [Department of State] and [<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>] representatives in Leopoldville recommend that the [<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>] representative be authorized to tell
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] that the US is prepared “in principle” to
                        assist them by providing funds on a temporary basis (three or four months)
                        to meet <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> pay demands providing the
                        following requirements are met:</p>
                    <p>a. Final approval would be contingent upon submission of <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> plans and the view of headquarters in
                        Washington.</p>
                    <p>b. <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> would immediately prepare plans to
                        counter the moves of the Gizenga regime (if it risks disaster, <hi rend="italic">sic.</hi>)</p>
                    <p>c. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and [<hi rend="italic">name
                            not declassified</hi>] would coordinate in advance future political and
                        military moves with the [<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>]
                        representative.</p>
                    <pb n="75" facs="0108" xml:id="pg_75"/>
                    <p>4. It is recognized that many powers would accuse the US of intervention if
                        the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> suddenly finds extra funds for the
                        troops. However, the [<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>] representative
                        believes he can fund the operation without any appreciable risk of
                        compromise. We have already been accused of doing more than we have done,
                        but to date no one has offered proof of US intervention. [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines not declassified</hi>]</p>

                    <p>On April 25, 1963, the Station in Leopoldville reported to Central
                        Intelligence Agency headquarters that it had received and reviewed a “first
                        batch” of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> papers [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] including letters dated

                        and <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Joseph Kasavubu</persName> approving
                            <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Patrice Lumumba</persName>’s transfer to
                        Katanga, and one dated January 13, 1961, to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Joseph Mobutu</persName> offering a payment of one million Belgian
                        Congolese francs in the hope that this sum would aid his army. The cable
                        said that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> had advised the
                        Congolese Government of the payment, which was made during the
                        “post-Coquilhatville reconciliation period,” and had turned the funds over
                        to the Congolese National Army. (Telegram 6730 to the Central Intelligence

                        inquiry from a Chief of Station regarding the authenticity of the January 15
                        letter to <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName>, stated that

                    <p>Based on cable traffic from Leopoldville concerning the possible need to

                        and <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> to cover a proposed

                            <persName corresp="#p_TBR_1">Tweedy</persName> had discussions with
                        Department of State on Friday<note n="2" xml:id="d57fn2">January 13.</note>
                        last. On Saturday morning an [<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>/Department of State] note was handed to Mr. Philip Clock.<note n="3" xml:id="d57fn3">See <ref target="#d55">Document 55</ref>.</note>
                        This memo reflected recommendations from <gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>, Leopoldville and concurred in by the Ambassador that an
                        undetermined amount of money be pledged in principle to [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] or <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> for troop payment. Certain provisions and demands
                        would accompany the pledge.</p>
                    <p>On Saturday, Mr. Clock handed the memo to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT_1">Merchant</persName>. I had advised Mr. Clock that according to our
                        information the Congo Government had openly pledged an increase in payment
                        to the troops at Thysville and planned to advise all of its commands that a
                        similar increase in payments would be forthcoming. Mr. Clock had wanted to
                        know what <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> thought of the proposal.
                        After discussions in the Division and with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRI_1">Helms</persName>, I told Mr. Clock that in view of the rapidly
                        deteriorating situation in the Congo<note n="4" xml:id="d57fn4">Telegram
                            0636 from Leopoldville to <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, January

                                <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> camp at Leopoldville), with
                            soldiers saying they had orders to arrest all officers and other troops
                            departing for Thysville with plans to liberate <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>. (Central Intelligence Agency
                            Files, Job 78–00435R, DDO/ISS Files, Box 1, Folder 6, [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] <gloss target="#t_Ops_1">Ops</gloss>)</note> that anything which could be done to hold it
                        together to give us additional time for planning and action would appear to
                        be worthwhile. Later in the morning (Saturday) Mr. Clock telephoned to say
                        that his office had been in consultation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT_1">Merchant</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT_1">Merchant</persName> had stated that the open
                        and public action taken by the Government of the Congo to promise increased
                        payment to the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> had put the earlier
                        Congelese request for money on an entirely different basis. He said that the
                        matter was now in the open and must be handled that way. He said the
                        question was should the United Nations assume this additional payment or
                        failing this, should the United <pb n="77" facs="0110" xml:id="pg_77"/>States offer to handle the increased payments in a bi-lateral way. If the
                        latter were to be the case, this would be overt and official. The question
                        of a bi-lateral approach for this purpose is one of high policy and is one
                        which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT_1">Merchant</persName> said that he
                        would not recommend to the President “in the next five days.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT_1">Merchant</persName> made it clear that the incoming
                        Secretary of State should be given the opportunity to decide whether or not
                        a bilateral approach should be used in this matter.</p>
                    <p>I told Mr. Clock that I could understand perfectly their rationale in this
                        decision but wondered if it took into account the urgency and time element
                        involved. Mr. Clock said he felt that although the commitment by <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> had been immediate that perhaps there
                        would be a lag period between now and the time additional funds were
                        actually needed on hand.</p>
                    <p>I asked Mr. Clock how much of the above we were at liberty to cable to <gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>, Leopoldville. He preferred that we not
                        forward all of the elements in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT_1">Merchant</persName>’s decision but suggested that we tell our man to
                        take no initiative in raising this with either [<hi rend="italic">name not
                            declassified</hi>] or <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>.
                        Should they take the initiative then the <gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss> would take that opportunity to find the answers to such
                        answers as:</p>
                    <p>a. How many troops are involved?</p>
                    <p>b. Total sum involved?</p>
                    <p>c. When is pay day?</p>
                    <p>d. How long can the Congolese continue payments without outside help?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Clock said that the Department would be sending the Ambassador
                        instructions on the whole question.</p>

                    <p>1. After discussions with [Department of State] on Saturday, January 14,
                        1961, [<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>] advised its representative as
                        follows concerning recent communications about possible action concerning
                        increased pay for the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>2. The [<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>] representative in Leopoldville
                        was advised that Washington had specifically noted that the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> had publicly declared its intention to
                        raise <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> pay. This, of course, puts the
                        matter on a different basis and this development is being given further
                        consideration here.</p>
                    <p>3. In the meanwhile, the [<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>]
                        representative was instructed not to approach either [<hi rend="italic">name
                            not declassified</hi>] or <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                        on this subject but to await their initiative. If and when they raise the
                        subject again, the [<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>] representative was
                        instructed to make no commitments but should take this opportunity to find
                        out:</p>
                    <p>a. How many troops are involved and where were they located,</p>
                    <p>b. Best estimate of money required,</p>
                    <p>c. When does <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> expect to make the first
                        increased payment to troops,</p>
                    <p>d. How long can <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> make payments without
                        additional outside help.</p>
                    <p>4. The [<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>] representative was instructed
                        that under no circumstances should he indicate that assistance might be
                        forthcoming.</p>

                        which they gave us gist of recommendations already submitted to Washington
                        for covert operation to bolster <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s forces. As we see <pb n="81" facs="0114" xml:id="pg_81"/>the situation in the Congo, in relation to Western
                        interests generally and in relation interests member countries of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> in African developments, believe covert
                        operation stands best chance of reversing present unsatisfactory situation
                        while avoiding large, obvious dangers implicit in overt bilateral aid by
                        Belgians or any other Western country. While we do not know details of
                        proposed operation and are in no position to evaluate chances of success, we
                        would favor prompt consideration, and fastest possible action if plan is
                        approved. From <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> point of view, believe
                        most member countries would expect U.S. to take action of this kind in
                        present deteriorating situation in the Congo. They would expect us to use
                        sufficient skill, determination and force to make it succeed, without

                    <p>In telegram 0662, January 20, 1961, the Station in Leopoldville reported to

                        were “constantly” urging financial aid for the Congolese National Army.
                        Otherwise, they said, their regime would fall. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> insisted that he must have a guarantee of financial
                        aid before he could launch a military operation against the Gizenga regime.
                        The next day, in telegram 21704 to Leopoldville, the Central Intelligence
                        Agency informed the Station that Headquarters was urgently seeking a review

                    <p>1. I regret that the force of circumstances has prevented me from writing the
                        usual [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] letters to you
                        during the Congo crisis. However, from personal meetings with [<persName corresp="#p_TBR_1">Tweedy</persName>] and [<persName corresp="#p_BRM_1">Bissell</persName>], I understand you have received regular and
                        detailed briefings on the operational developments in this area. I am taking
                        the liberty of writing this special letter to you because I wish to call to
                        your attention a matter which I believe is of direct concern to <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>2. Many rumors have come to the attention of the Embassy and the Station to
                        the effect that, with the change in administration, our policy in the Congo
                        will be reversed and that we will favor a return of <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> in some capacity to the Congolese
                        Government. Persons relating these rumors almost invariably add that
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TCH_1">Timberlake</persName> will be
                        replaced by a person who favors the establishment of close relations with
                            <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> and his supporters.
                        These rumors have been brought to my attention by many Congolese political
                        figures (some of them clandestine contacts of this Station), journalists and
                        representatives of other governments, as well as press reports of which you
                        are undoubtedly aware. Needless to say, these rumors are beginning to have
                        an adverse effect upon our operational efforts, for some assets are afraid
                        the Station will reverse its current policy and that, as a result of their
                        confidential cooperation with us, they will be abandoned to suffer the
                        consequences of their acts. This situation has not reached the state at
                        which Station efforts are hampered appreciably, but in view of the pessimism
                        and defeatism which is so prevalent in Leopoldville at this time, the
                        continued spread of such rumors could undermine the Station’s position
                        rather rapidly, should they become accepted by the local population. Thus,
                        any steps which can be taken by the appropriate authorities <pb n="84" facs="0117" xml:id="pg_84"/> to nip these rumors in the bud would be of
                        considerable aid to the Leopoldville Station. In this respect, the inaugural
                        address was well received in the Congo and raised the hopes of many
                        Congolese.</p>
                    <p>3. The rumors concerning the possible replacement of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TCH_1">Timberlake</persName> also have a direct effect upon
                        Station operations. As I have reported in numerous communications,
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TCH_1">Timberlake</persName> has proved to
                        be a strong supporter of <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss> in
                        general, and, specifically, he has provided the aid, guidance, and support
                        necessary for the implementation of our clandestine operations. Without his
                        strong support, it would not have been possible for the Station to
                        accomplish many of the operational objectives assigned by Headquarters to
                        support <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> policy in the Congo. As a
                        result of <persName corresp="#p_TCH_1">Timberlake</persName>’s dynamic and
                        effective brand of diplomacy, he has been personally attacked by [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]. According to
                        journalistic contacts of the Station and the Embassy, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] has launched a campaign against
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TCH_1">Timberlake</persName>, accusing him
                        of undermining the objectives and work of the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                            line not declassified</hi>]. It would appear that [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] objective in this campaign is
                        to bring about the recall of the Ambassador and the appointment of a
                        replacement more amenable to his personal influence and policies, policies
                        which do not seem to be in accord with the policy directives received by
                        this Station.</p>
                    <p>4. While I realize that major policy decisions and the selection of senior
                        government officials are not, and should not be, the responsibility of
                            <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss> field personnel, I believe
                        this is a situation which warrants your personal attention. Insofar as our
                        Congo policy is concerned, I firmly believe that a drastic change at this
                        time would be both disastrous and ineffectual. A change would not only
                        alienate those persons and assets who support our present policy, but it is
                        my opinion that it would also not be possible to win the support or
                        friendship of the opposition leaders. While they might be willing to accept
                        our financial and technical aid, they also would turn to the <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss> and the Soviet Bloc with requests for aid
                        and technical assistance. As their appetites would be insatiable, we would
                        soon reach a point beyond which we would not be prepared to fulfill their
                        requests. At that point, I believe they would turn more and more to the
                        Soviet Bloc for aid and that in a very short time the Congo would fall under
                        the influence, if not the control, of the Soviet Bloc. The opinions which I
                        have expressed herein relative to a possible Bloc take over in the Congo are
                        shared, to the best of my knowledge, by all Embassy personnel and many other
                        qualified observers who have had an opportunity to observe the Congo crisis
                        at first hand. I thus submit these views to you for your personal
                        consideration.</p>
                    <p>5. Although I am reluctant to raise matters which are not within my field of
                        competence, I feel it incumbent upon me to draw to your attention <pb n="85" facs="0118" xml:id="pg_85"/> the unfailing support and cooperation this
                        Station has received from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TCH_1">Timberlake</persName> and to note that one reason he is being attacked
                        by [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] is that <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> policy, which is supported by
                        clandestine <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss> operations, often has
                        appeared to be in conflict with [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] personal policy for the Congo. Most of the
                        allegations made against <persName corresp="#p_TCH_1">Timberlake</persName>
                        by [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] are false, but
                            [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] obviously
                        suspects some of the political activities of <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>’s opponents are inspired by covert <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> operations and he blames <persName corresp="#p_TCH_1">Timberlake</persName> for this. In short, one of the
                        reasons for which <persName corresp="#p_TCH_1">Timberlake</persName> is
                        under fire is that he has firmly advocated <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> policy in the Congo, including <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss> operations designed to support such
                            <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> policy. Thus, should it be
                        decided to recall Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TCH_1">Timberlake</persName>, as is rumored in Leopoldville, I believe it
                        would be only logical that I, too, be transferred to another post of duty,
                        should the reason for his recall be related to his support of <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> policy and <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss> operations. In this respect, I
                        should note that my usefulness in this area in the near future would
                        probably be limited, should <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss>
                        policy toward the Congo undergo a complete reversal. Many Station assets
                        would almost certainly believe that I had betrayed them and hold me
                        personally responsible for encouraging them to take positions which, with a
                        reversal of <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> policy, would become
                        extremely dangerous. In all probability many would refuse to cooperate with
                            <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss> or any other <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> agency, in the future, and some
                        might attempt to buy their personal safety by denouncing me or other <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> personnel.</p>

                    <p>4. Some of the questions here arise from a variety of opinions and reports on

                        called to say that they were having an internal meeting on the policy paper
                        on the Congo.<note n="3" xml:id="d66fn3">See <ref target="frus1961-63v20#d17">Document 17, <hi rend="italic">Foreign

                        He asked whether we had any further comments on it. I said that there were
                        some bothersome aspects to it. These were the facts that on the one hand we
                        would be taming <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and on the
                        other releasing <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>. In essence
                        we were generating a sequence of events which would lead to a political
                        being in the Congo the ultimate orientation of which could not be assured.
                        He said that these risks had been taken into account and believed to be
                        acceptable. I said that I felt that if the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> in fact did neutralize in a strong way the political and
                        military elements in the Congo and did take control in a neutral way, then
                        this, combined with the administrative structure outlined in the third
                        element of the proposal, would indeed make the risk of a pro-Lumumbist
                        takeover more remote. I emphasized that strong neutral <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> action would be the key to it. I asked him
                        what he thought <persName corresp="#p_TCH_1">Timberlake</persName>’s
                        reaction would be. He didn’t know, but suggested that it would appear that
                            <persName corresp="#p_TCH_1">Timberlake</persName> had no concrete
                        alternative proposals.<note n="4" xml:id="d66fn4">At the 475th meeting of

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Support Continuation of the United Nations Effort
                        on Essentially Its Present Basis.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Action Required</hi></p>
                    <p>1. Keep the Belgians from intervening, on larger scale, and lower the boom on
                        them if they do.</p>
                    <p>2. Allow the Katanga and South Kasai “situation of fact” to continue
                        essentially unchanged.</p>
                    <p>3. Be prepared to continue to pay the bulk of the bill while leaving the
                        policy control with Hammarskjold.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Probable Consequences</hi></p>
                    <p>1. Faint possibility <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> might
                        bring off his present offensive with short term favorable results but no
                        guarantee increased stability.</p>
                    <p>2. Probability Gizenga forces will take over through breakdown <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> forces in Leopoldville without
                        actual fighting in face of ruthlessness and forward motion of Gizenga
                        forces.</p>
                    <p>3. Belgians will either—</p>
                    <p>a) heed our request not to intervene, but hold us bitterly responsible for
                        unfavorable outcome; or</p>
                    <p>b) intervene in half-baked way, which is unlikely to stem the tide more
                        likely.</p>
                    <p>4. If Gizenga takes over, will put himself increasingly under Communist wing,
                        though probably Soviets will be more discreet this time and work throught
                        Czechs, <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss> and Guinea. Probable rapid
                        increase of <gloss target="#t_Chicom_1">Chicom</gloss> influence through
                            <persName corresp="#p_MPI_1">Mulele</persName> in particular.</p>
                    <p>5. Flight of whites (as in Province Orientale) and consequent economic
                        breakdown, which will assist Communist penetration. Also flight of moderate
                        Congolese.</p>
                    <pb n="89" facs="0122" xml:id="pg_89"/>
                    <p>6. Probable center of Gizenga policy would be military action against South
                        Kasai and Katanga (as <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>
                        tried), eventually also Angola, etc.</p>
                    <p>7. <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> would be pushed out gradually as it
                        ceased to serve Gizenga’s purposes. Disastrous consequences for <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> would only be deferred.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Advantages</hi></p>
                    <p>None we can think of.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Disadvantages</hi></p>
                    <p>1. Introduction of more virulent form of Communist satellite in heart of
                        Central Africa, with constant threat to peace and security of all of Black
                        Africa (see above).</p>
                    <p>2. Serious blow to Belgo-American relations (see point 3 above) and to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> unity (c.f. Suez crisis).</p>
                    <p>3. Serious blow to future of <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Redirect and Beef up <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Effort</p>
                    <p>A. Minimum solution: Seal off Congo frontiers and airfields in order to
                        isolate Congo from outside intervention, but without further <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> intervention in internal affairs.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Action Required</hi></p>
                    <p>1. Make real effort to obtain Soviet agreement to mutual non-intervention, if
                        this proves feasible.</p>
                    <p>2. If not, we will need effective support of moderate (non-Casablanca) group
                        in <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> to outvote Soviets and Casablanca
                        group, as on <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>
                        credentials.</p>
                    <p>3. <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> forces and mixed control groups must be
                        stationed at <hi rend="italic">all</hi> significant frontier points and
                        airfields and be willing to use force to prevent inflow of military aid.</p>
                    <p>4. This will require substantial reinforcement of <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> forces, and in addition more trustworthy ones (Australian,
                        South American, etc., not just African).</p>
                    <p>5. This will also require full commitment by Hammarskjold to an active
                        policy, which in turn will require Security Council or <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> resolution (depending on whether Soviets
                        cooperate or not).</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_DRA_1">Dayal</persName> must be replaced by an
                        objective, honest and energetic man prepared to use his mandate to the full.
                        Cdr. Jackson, a good Nigerian, etc.</p>
                    <p>7. Outside aid to Katanga and South Kasai will also have to be stopped, which
                        means</p>
                    <pb n="90" facs="0123" xml:id="pg_90"/>
                    <p>a) Obtain full Belgian cooperation, which will be difficult until
                        mid-April.</p>
                    <p>b) Scuttling <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s would
                        automatically be seriously weakened.</p>
                    <p>8. <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> must at least help to train Congo
                        Army.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Advantages</hi></p>
                    <p>1. Reduce chances of hot war involving US and Soviet Union in Congo.</p>
                    <p>2. Cut ground out from under Gizenga, assuming he is largely dependent on
                        outside help.</p>
                    <p>3. Make possible at least limited success of <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Disadvantages</hi></p>
                    <p>1. There is real doubt this will work.</p>
                    <p>2. Makes no provision for longer-term settlement of Congo’s problems, which
                        will continue to plague us for a long time.</p>
                    <p>3. Will require a remarkable degree of continuing support from Europeans and
                        Africans to work.</p>
                    <p>4. May well cause instability and chaos to spread to Katanga.</p>
                    <p>5. The major burden of economic support for Congo will fall even more heavily
                        on the US.</p>
                    <p>B. Intermediate solution: Seal off borders, etc., as in A. but put <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> forces in position to help Congolese Central
                        Government to maintain order.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Action Required</hi></p>
                    <p>1. All action mentioned under A above.</p>
                    <p>2. Installation of a Central Government which <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> can recognize.</p>
                    <p>3. More troops required, and probably a stronger <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> mandate.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Advantages</hi></p>
                    <p>1. As above, Section A.</p>
                    <p>2. Speedier elimination of Gizenga and other harmful elements.</p>
                    <p>3. Better chance of creating long-term stability in Congo.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Disadvantages</hi></p>
                    <p>1. Difficulty of obtaining a clearly legal government.</p>
                    <p>2. More difficult to obtain <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> mandate and
                        perhaps less support from Afro-Asians.</p>
                    <p>3. Probability of continued friction between <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>C. Maximum solutions: Seal off frontiers, disarm all <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> forces and <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> takes over
                        responsibility for creation and maintenance of order.</p>
                    <pb n="91" facs="0124" xml:id="pg_91"/>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Action Required</hi></p>
                    <p>1. All of above, plus.</p>
                    <p>2. Even more troops.</p>
                    <p>3. Agreement of Congolese Government or decision to override their
                        wishes.</p>
                    <p>4. The <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> would have to have a real political
                        policy-making body or delegate that power to its Representative.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Advantages</hi></p>
                    <p>1. If it worked, there might be some real chance of having law and order in
                        the Congo.</p>
                    <p>2. Hence there might be better chance for longer-term solution.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Disadvantages</hi></p>
                    <p>1. Difficult to believe Congolese Government would ever accept this
                        “trusteeship”. Cannot make it work without or against them.</p>
                    <p>2. Probably impossible to obtain <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> majority

                        political decision-making necessary in fact to govern the Congo.</p>
                    <p>4. Even more troops and money required.</p>

                    <p>1. If we are determined to play the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> card,
                        we must be prepared to throw our assets into the balance, and also to make

                        support of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> effort, which means its
                        termination.</p>
                    <p>2. Effective action along any of above lines will require several months at
                        least. But within a month or a bit more, if things continue as they are,

                    <p>A. Minimum effort: Combined US-Belgian military assistance on
                        quasi-clandestine basis designed to permit <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s forces to stop the advance of Gizenga’s troops and

                    <p>1. Most important, Belgians must provide 100-odd officers to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> on as clandestine a basis as
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>2. US must provide financial and material support.</p>

                    <p>3. Belgian-US effort must be closely coordinated in the field.</p>
                    <p>4. US must give Belgium at least tacit support and cover in <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> for their part of the operation.</p>
                    <p>5. A strong propaganda barrage against <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Disadvantages</hi></p>
                    <p>1. Harmful effects on our posture in <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and

                    <p>2. Could call forth an intensification of Soviet and <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss> intervention, on their side, which might require our

                    <p>B. Intermediate effort: More overtbilateral Western military assistance to
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>, but short of direct
                        involvement of American personnel. Purpose would be to defeat Gizenga forces

                    <p>1. Would put us in clear opposition to <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and

                    <p>3. Pro-Western Congolese leaders are weak reeds, and might not be able to
                        exploit even a clear military advantage. Hence no guarantee of permanent
                        political solution.</p>
                    <p>C. Direct intervention by US and Western forces. (This is clearly only a last
                        resort possibility in answer to massive Soviet intervention.)</p>
                    <p rend="center">General Comments on Alternative III</p>
                    <p>1. Difficulty of keeping things really clandestine, especially if Belgians
                        involved.</p>
                    <p>2. Need for effective coordination of Western efforts in all cases.</p>

                    <p>4. Once we start on the road of military intervention, we may inevitably be

                        prior to effective implementation of a more vigorous <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> operation that will ensure orderly political development

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">2.</hi> Assumptions:</p>
                    <p>It is assumed that it is in our interest to ensure that the <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>/Gizenga forces, with or without
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss> and Sino-Soviet support, do not
                        regain control of the country during the period in which the United Nations
                        is attempting to strengthen its hand in the Congo. It is also assumed that
                        it is our objective to have the Congo emerge as a country unified along
                        acceptable political and economic lines.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">3.</hi> Facts and Discussion:</p>
                    <p>At the present time the <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>
                        forces, under the leadership of Gizenga, are making every effort to regain
                        control of the Congo by military means from their Stanleyville base.
                        Available intelligence indicates that Gizenga has received support from the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss> consisting of money and weapons,
                        and that further <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss> as well as Sino-Soviet
                        Bloc logistic support to the Stanleyville regime will be forthcoming.</p>
                    <p>The only counter-balance to military action by Gizenga consists of General
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s military forces in
                        Leopoldville and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s army in
                        Katanga. Reporting from Leopoldville and Elizabethville indicates <pb n="97" facs="0130" xml:id="pg_97"/>that these forces are currently the target
                        of strong military pressure and subversive efforts directed from
                        Stanleyville. As presently constituted, they are poorly led, in need of
                        weapons, communications equipment, and motor transport, and require, in the
                        case of <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s forces, sufficient
                        funds to ensure the loyalty of troops.</p>
                    <p>In Leopoldville our official representatives have been requested by Congolese
                        Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> and General
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> to provide funds to
                        maintain their forces.</p>
                    <p>In Elizabethville, Katanga army representatives have requested aid in the
                        form of weapons and aircraft. In view of the support that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> is apparently receiving from
                        Belgian sources, no action on our part in this regard is considered
                        advisable at this time.</p>
                    <p>The Belgian Foreign Office has advised that <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> has made a specific request to Belgium for military
                        assistance consisting of arms, money and training instructors. <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> has also approached the French
                        Foreign Office indicating the seriousness of the situation and requesting
                        French assistance, particularly for arms.</p>
                    <p>At the present time diplomatic initiatives are being taken primarily through
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> to find a consensus which would allow
                        for a solution to the Congo problem. It is expected that whatever final
                        solution evolves at the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, the
                        implementation of these actions will at least take several weeks or, more
                        probably, months. It is believed that the widespread publicity which has
                        attended the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> considerations, as well as
                        any number of diplomatic feelers which have been put out, cannot help but
                        have a deteriorating effect on the morale and stability of moderate
                        Congolese political and military leaders. It follows that in the interval
                        between the present and the date of reasonably effective implementation of
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> policy, it is desirable to provide,
                        in a quiet but effective way, reassurance and support to these moderate
                        leaders. This, in effect, would constitute a holding action until it became
                        clear that such support was either unnecessary or conflicting openly with
                        generally accepted and effective <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                        actions.</p>
                    <p>This support would also enable our representatives to maintain a degree of
                        influence over the leaders of the Congolese Government to obtain their
                        cooperation in any solution worked out by the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">4.</hi> Conclusions:</p>
                    <p>In view of these developments, it is concluded that steps should be taken to
                        improve the capabilities of Congolese Government forces to provide a
                        counter-balance to military action by <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> forces directed at regaining control of the Congo.
                        Without maintenance in being of these forces there is an imminent risk that
                        military action from Stanleyville, supported by the <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss> and the Sino-Soviet Bloc, will regain <pb n="98" facs="0131" xml:id="pg_98"/>control of the Congo for the <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> forces prior to implementation of
                        any effective action by the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">5.</hi> Action Recommended:</p>
                    <p>It is recommended, that in order to preserve General <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s military capabilities and to
                        maintain the integrity of the moderate Congolese leadership supporting
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>, authorization be
                        granted to provide financial assistance to the Congolese Government through
                        clandestine channels, initially up to a total of [<hi rend="italic">number
                            not declassified</hi>]. It is understood that these funds would be used
                        by the Congolese to obtain transport, arms and communications equipment, to
                        supplement salaries of loyal troops and for action in the political field.
                        Every effort will be made to ensure that the funds are used for this purpose
                        and not diverted to the individual members of the regime.</p>
                    <p>It is possible that this authorization will have to be increased when the
                        urgent requirements of the Congolese Government are better known, perhaps
                        within the next few weeks.</p>

                        heard many stories including that deaths occurred January 17, 18, or 19 from
                        effects of initial bad treatment, on January 26 as result intentional

                        Speculating on these versions, I would accept as most likely original
                        stories that <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> and associates
                        died on January 17 to 19 as result of miscalculation concerning amount of
                        physical punishment they could endure. Reason for my choice is story given
                        me from creditable source that Lucas Samelenge, Secretary State for
                        Information, told associates in this period they must prepare believable
                        story concerning <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>’s
                        accidental death. Samelenge and associates immediately silenced by Surete

                        receiving the documents themselves through VIP pouch by 10 April.</p>
                    <p>1. Three interesting notes on <persName corresp="#p_MPI_1">Mulele</persName>’s Moscow trip in early March:</p>
                    <p>a. In regard to military assistance, the Soviets promise arms for 25,000 of
                        Gizenga’s men. A test delivery of arms will be sent to Stanleyville via
                        Accra following verbal instructions to Gizenga. Two or three security
                        experts will come to advise Gizenga, and the Soviets suggest a loyal cadre
                        of eight to ten young Congolese be formed to undergo training by these
                        experts. Necessary equipment for the embryonic security service will be
                        forwarded as soon as communications are opened.</p>
                    <p>b. In regard to diplomatic action, the African States recognizing Gizenga’s
                        government should take action together against the Sudan’s refusal to grant
                        transit rights to province Orientale, and the signatories to the resolutions
                        of the Casablanca Conference in early January should put their troops with
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Forces in the Congo at the disposal
                        of the Gizenga regime.</p>
                    <p>c. In regard to general Soviet support of Gizenga, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> will give all aid necessary as soon as
                        transit rights can be arranged: This is the responsibility of the African
                        leaders, particularly <persName corresp="#p_NKW_1">Nkrumah</persName>,
                            <persName corresp="#p_TSE_1">Sekou Toure</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NGA_1">Nasser</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KMO_1">Modibo Keita</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan
                            II</persName>. Furthermore, the Soviet Government</p>
                    <p>1. Which had agreed to put at the disposal of Stanleyville 6 L 12 planes,
                        agrees to replace these with two to four IL–18’s. As soon as transit rights
                        are granted, these planes will be en route to Stanleyville.</p>
                    <p>2. Will deliver immediately a 30 KW 7 ton radio and within two months will
                        deliver a 150 KW station to be set in operation by Soviet technicians.</p>
                    <pb n="106" facs="0139" xml:id="pg_106"/>
                    <p>3. Promises 150 scholarships for the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        People’s Friendship University.</p>
                    <p>4. Guarantees immediate financial aid in a new proposal carried to Gizenga
                        verbally.</p>
                    <p>5. Assures that military training is immediately available in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> for any number of Gizenga’s men.</p>
                    <p>2. Notes of the final decision of the Czech Government in regard to its
                        posture vis-à-vis Gizenga. Based on <persName corresp="#p_MPI_1">Mulele</persName>’s conversations in Prague 14–15 March, this document
                        states that a five man diplomatic mission will be accredited to Stanleyville
                        with a Congolese delegation welcomed in Prague and that there will be on 18
                        March the simultaneous announcement in Prague and Cairo of a commercial
                        accord between Stanleyville and the Czech Government which will assist in
                        forcing the Sudanese blockade. The Czechs told <persName corresp="#p_MPI_1">Mulele</persName> that when the accord is followed by contracts between
                        a Czech company and a genuine firm in Stanleyville, it is a mere formality
                        to demand that the Sudan Government allow transit of goods. The Czechs will
                        also continue their efforts to establish a Congolese air line, based in
                        Stanleyville, and the creation of an air link between
                        Prague–Cairo–Khartoum–Stanleyville and/or Prague–Cairo–Red Sea–Addis
                        Ababa–Uganda–Stanleyville. The Czechs also promise immediate financial aid,
                        the details of which will be relayed to Gizenga verbally.</p>
                    <p>3. A message from J. Messena, former Minister of Labor in the <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> government, sent via <persName corresp="#p_MPI_1">Mulele</persName> for Gizenga. Datelined 19 February,
                        Bulunga, it is essentially a request for funds and weapons to recruit and
                        arm a private army of 20,000 men in the Kwilu–Kwongo area to replace the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> contingents now there.</p>
                    <p>4. Some propositions for military aid to the Stanleyville regime, datelined
                        16 March, Cairo, [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>]. This
                        recommends the formation of a special two to four man office, including one
                        aide from the <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss> and separate from the
                        diplomatic mission yet under the control of <persName corresp="#p_MPI_1">Mulele</persName>, to study but not implement all possible methods for
                        transporting military equipment into Orientale province. Also proposed is
                        the establishment of a short wave radio link between Stanleyville and Cairo
                        and Stanleyville and Europe, the creation of liaison (personal messengers)
                        between Stanleyville and friendly elements throughout the Congo, the
                        enlistment of a group of military specialists (some from Europe) who will
                        organize Congo-wide operations and the formation of an underground cadre for
                        action in Leopoldville province.</p>
                    <p>5. In a letter from Andre Eduard Kanza to Gizenga, datelined 23 March, Cairo,
                        Kanza reveals that the position of the “Nationalists” in Leopoldville is
                        very difficult and that his father, Daniel Kanza, is holding his political
                        party together but desperately needs funds. Andre Kanza has had several
                        secret meetings in Leopoldville with various sympathizers, at one of which
                        Kimvay and <persName corresp="#p_KCL_1">Kamitatu</persName> were present.
                            <pb n="107" facs="0140" xml:id="pg_107"/>Andre Kanza states that he
                        decided it was now necessary to pretend to <persName corresp="#p_KCL_1">Kamitatu</persName> and Kimvay that he was with the “puppets” and to
                        aver that he himself would attempt to interfere with the effectiveness of
                        Gizenga’s activities.</p>
                    <p>6. A copy of a long, undated letter from Argiry Emmanuel (a Greek Communist
                        long linked with leftist Congolese circles) to <persName corresp="#p_MPI_1">Pierre Mulele</persName> in Cairo outlining a variety of proposals for
                        establishing secure transportation and mail channels between Stanleyville
                        and the outside world.</p>

                        to review again the whole subject of military and paramilitary aid to

                        planned and included the agreement with the Belgians and preliminary talks
                        with other countries. The impetus for those was the apparent Gizenga
                        military advance and the need to shore up the Congolese National Army as
                        soon as possible, but it now appeared that the Gizenga forces posed little
                        threat, and <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Joseph Mobutu</persName> was now
                        conducting at least preliminary negotiations with Victor Lundula. The
                        prospects for a <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>–Lundula armed
                        clash were slight. The biggest threat of an armed clash was between the
                            <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> and the United Nations Operations
                        in the Congo (<gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss>). If this assessment
                        was approximately right, <persName corresp="#p_TBR_1">Tweedy</persName>
                        stated, then a question arose as to whether continued emphasis should be
                        placed on third countries as military or paramilitary advisers. <persName corresp="#p_TBR_1">Tweedy</persName> requested the Chief of Station’s
                        views on the subject. (Central Intelligence Agency Files, Job 78–00435R,

                        April 14, the Chief of Station responded that he generally concurred with
                            <persName corresp="#p_TBR_1">Tweedy</persName> but believed that some
                        military or paramilitary advisers would be of continuing use if and when the
                        Congo situation again reached the boiling point. The Station assumed that

                        the Congo (<gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>) under President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> by assisting members of the
                        present government to obtain a working majority in the Congolese Parliament
                        which the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> is planning to reconvene at
                        an early date.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Assumptions:</hi> It is assumed that it is in our
                        interest to insure the parliamentary victory of individuals in the present
                        government of the Congo to prevent the <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>/Gizenga forces of the Stanleyville regime from
                        gaining power in the Congo through legal means.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Facts and Discussion:</hi> The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> has announced that Parliament will be reconvened at an
                        early date to consider the resolutions of the Round Table Conference which
                        has been meeting at Coquilhatville. The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                        has also announced publicly that a government headed by <persName corresp="#p_IJO_1">Joseph Ileo</persName> will be submitted for
                        parliamentary approval at that time.</p>
                    <p>While a parliamentary victory of individuals in the present <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> will not eliminate all the major problems
                        facing the country, the victory of certain members of the government will be
                        essential to permit an approach to the long-term solutions of these
                        problems. More vigorous action by members of the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> in this regard is required to offset an active program of
                        the Gizenga regime in Stanleyville to dominate Parliament when reconvened.
                        Most recent estimates indicate that <persName corresp="#p_IJO_1">Ileo</persName> could probably muster 51 votes out of a total of 136 in
                        the Chamber, and probably 31 votes out of a total of 83 in the Senate.
                        Taking into consideration <pb n="110" facs="0143" xml:id="pg_110"/> current
                        trends, it appears that <persName corresp="#p_IJO_1">Ileo</persName> will
                        have difficulty in obtaining a vote of confidence if the Gizenga forces
                        attend.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Conclusions:</hi> It is concluded that steps should be
                        taken to support key individuals in the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                        in their efforts to obtain a working majority in the Congolese Parliament.
                        If these individuals fail to obtain parliamentary control, there is a real
                        danger that the country will fall under domination of the
                        Gizenga/Stanleyville regime.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Action Recommended:</hi> It is recommended that the
                        following actions, which have been proposed by our Leopoldville
                        representative with the concurrence of the Chief of Mission, be authorized
                        to support key, friendly elements of the Congo government in their efforts
                        to obtain a parliamentary majority:</p>
                    <p>a. Attempt to convince leaders of the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                        coalition to agree in advance on candidates for key ministerial positions
                        and on a platform for action that will hold Congo-wide appeal.</p>
                    <p>b. Urge the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> leaders to select 10 to 15
                        Parliamentarians to serve as whips to swing certain selected deputies into
                        line behind the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> coalition. If pressure
                        is not sufficient, these whips or other reliable contacts will be directed
                        to utilize other methods, such as outright payments of money, promises of
                        foreign travel, scholarships, etc. as required for particular deputies.
                        Funds will also be provided to <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                        coalition leaders themselves to enable them to invite selected
                        Parliamentarians to their houses for political discussions.</p>
                    <p>c. Reliable contacts will be used to influence youth groups, trade unions and
                        tribal organizations to contact and persuade Parliamentary deputies, over
                        whom they may have some measure of control, to line up with the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> coalition. In this regard, funds may be
                        used to induce regional political, labor union, or other leaders not in
                        Leopoldville to put pressure on deputies from their respective regions.
                        Funds can also be expended to bring key regional leaders to Leopoldville
                        from the provinces to influence deputies from their area or tribe.</p>
                    <p>d. Demonstrations by youth groups can be organized to support personalities
                        and policies of the developing <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                        coalition.</p>
                    <p>e. Funds may be utilized to discourage the possible shift of allegiances to
                        the Gizenga forces. [<hi rend="italic">3½ lines not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>6. No action is to be taken, prior to the opening of Parliament, which could
                        reveal to Gizenga that his attendance and negotiations for reintegration of
                        his areas would be fruitless. The program under discussion should be
                        envisaged as aid [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]
                        in organizing a government which will have the allegiance of all areas of
                        the Congo and be controlled by the moderates. If Gizenga does not attend
                        Parliament and maintains his present separate position, no special program
                        such as outlined above is needed and none should be launched. <pb n="111" facs="0144" xml:id="pg_111"/>In this contingency it is expected that
                        highly discreet actions on a much reduced basis would be considered on their
                        merits as opportunities arise. If he attends, the program should be limited
                        day to day to those actions which are required to achieve the above goals.
                        It is not assumed that an all-out effort will be needed; it may be, but
                        activity should rise by escalation, on a strict need-for basis. Extreme care
                        should be taken to avoid prejudicing the future effectiveness of the
                        politicians to be aided.</p>
                    <p>7. It is recommended that a maximum of [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                            declassified</hi>] be authorized for this program if Gizenga attends and
                        it appears this amount can be usefully spent. If expenditures of this
                        magnitude are required in <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1961, it will
                        be necessary to draw on [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not

                        funds are available within existing allocations.<note n="2" xml:id="d82fn2">On June 6, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Wayne Fredericks</persName> sent a memorandum to

                        danger of bringing in a representative of Moscow who would attempt to
                        subvert and control the government. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG_1">Bundy</persName> felt that he could not approve this program without
                        reference to higher authority.<note n="4" xml:id="d83fn4">On June 10,

                            arranged with the President to discuss all U.S. clandestine activities
                            in support of political leaders and parties, including in particular a
                            proposal for action in the Congo. One small aspect of the Congo
                            proposal, however, had been presented with an urgency that had led him
                            to approve it in the President’s absence on the basis of clear State
                            Department concurrence—an expenditure of [<hi rend="italic">dollar

                            designed to strengthen the moderate camp in the Congo. <persName corresp="#p_BMG_1">Bundy</persName> stated that there was danger of
                            losing an important moderate group if U.S. action were delayed and noted
                            that “very much larger sums have been spent in the past in the same
                            direction, through the same channels and without embarrassment.” (See

                        to revise his government and present it to Parliament for approval, most
                        Congolese political leaders are convinced he will not be able to obtain a
                        confidence vote. Other individuals who might possibly form a government
                        include <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BJE_1">Bolikango</persName>, Gizenga and <persName corresp="#p_KCL_1">Kamitatu</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName>
                        has eliminated himself from the race and is currently supporting <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>. These two individuals have agreed
                        to work together closely to obtain a moderate government.</p>
                    <p>If <persName corresp="#p_IJO_1">Ileo</persName> withdraws or fails to obtain
                        a confidence vote, <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> appears
                        the most likely candidate to form a government. In view of Gizenga’s and
                            <persName corresp="#p_KCL_1">Kamitatu</persName>’s opposition to
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> it is doubtful that he
                        would call upon either of them unless no other person was available.
                        Although <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> is working closely
                        with <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> and does not feel that
                            <persName corresp="#p_IJO_1">Ileo</persName> can form a government, he
                        does not want to appear to be undercutting <persName corresp="#p_IJO_1">Ileo</persName> at the present time.</p>
                    <p>Our Leopoldville representative has referred to Embassy Dispatch No. 468 of
                        May 24, 1961<note n="3" xml:id="d84fn3">Not found.</note> which contains
                        revised estimates of potential voting lineup in the Congolese party. This
                        dispatch gives <persName corresp="#p_IJO_1">Ileo</persName> a probable 60
                        votes out of a total of 136 in the Chamber and 44 probable votes out of a
                        total of 83 in the Senate. These figures are considered overly optimistic
                        and we have been advised that both the Embassy and our representative are
                        working up a new estimate based upon current consultations with local
                        contacts.</p>
                    <p>Prospects for Government of Katanga participation in Parliament appear
                        increasingly good, but the final outcome will be dependent on the Milan
                        negotiations and continued efforts by the Congolese government and the
                            <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss>. The question of Gizenga’s
                        participation remains uncertain. It is possible that some of his followers
                        will come to Parliament if they are given protection and transportation by
                        the <pb n="114" facs="0147" xml:id="pg_114"/><gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss>, even if Gizenga himself refuses to attend. This does not
                        mean, however, that they would necessarily support a moderate government. It
                        is doubted that Gizenga would personally attend Parliament even though he
                        might send his chief followers. Our representative believes that it is
                        wishful thinking to expect Gizenga and his followers to accept minor
                        positions in the new government. It is considered that he would not settle
                        for less than the post of Vice Premier if admitted to the government.</p>
                    <p>Our representative recommends that we not go all out in support of <persName corresp="#p_IJO_1">Ileo</persName> if it appears that he has little
                        chance of forming a government. It is, however, considered that <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> would vote for and support <persName corresp="#p_IJO_1">Ileo</persName> in the initial instance even though
                        convinced he has little chance of winning a vote of confidence. Our support
                            [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] would
                        therefore not be in opposition to <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>’s designation of <persName corresp="#p_IJO_1">Ileo</persName> as the individual to attempt to form a government.</p>
                    <p>Both the Ambassador and our representative disagree with the view that a
                        relatively large program will not be necessary if Gizenga does not attend
                        Parliament. The need to undertake such a program at the earliest possible
                        date is emphasized.</p>
                    <p>It is agreed that the operation should proceed on a strict need-for basis,
                        under the Ambassador’s control, and with selected Congolese deciding who is
                        to be aided, and how.</p>
                    <p>Our representative states that the majority of funds used in the program can
                        be handled so that the U.S. Government can plausibly deny involvement.
                        Frequent status reports will be provided. Every effort will be made to avoid
                        prejudicing future effectiveness of the individuals to be aided. They will
                        be discouraged from taking extreme positions.<note n="4" xml:id="d84fn4"><gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> telegram 45581 to

                        representation in govt of group centered around Gizenga, altho no sensitive
                        position should be given this group. We believe such representation

                        Orientale and Kivu, as well as recognition by African and Asian nations in

                    <p rend="center">CONGO POLITICAL ACTION DEVELOPMENTS</p>
                    <p>The following has been received from our Leopoldville Station in response to
                        our standing request for periodic progress reports on the Congo Political
                        Action Program:<note n="2" xml:id="d87fn2">The paper is based on telegram
                            1554 from Leopoldville to <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, June 27.
                            (Ibid.)</note></p>
                    <p>A. The station is devoting the majority of its time talking with Congolese
                        leaders and other persons of political influence trying to obtain a clear
                        picture of political developments and to encourage support of the United
                        States Government position. As a result of political jockeying, it is not
                        possible to arrive at a definitive opinion regarding the probable outcome of
                        the meeting of Parliament. The political scene is constantly changing and
                        leaders have not yet adopted final positions.</p>
                    <p>B. Our station is working very closely with the Embassy in Leopoldville
                        passing all political information received. Embassy coverage of developments
                        is considered excellent and as a result our reporting will concentrate on
                        operational developments.</p>
                    <p>C. At the present time, the parliamentary lineup appears to be fairly even
                        between <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and Gizenga groups. The release
                        of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> is considered a <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> effort to obtain the support of the <gloss target="#t_CONAKAT_1">CONAKAT</gloss> Party. <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName>
                        hope to create a Leopoldville/Elisabethville axis to obtain greater
                        bargaining strength in an effort to reach an agreement with Stanleyville.
                        However, <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> is not at all certain
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> will keep his word and
                        send parliamentarians to Lovanium now that he has returned to
                        Elisabethville. <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> continues his
                        previous efforts to pick up <gloss target="#t_MNC_1">MNC</gloss>/<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> and <gloss target="#t_PSA_1">PSA</gloss> votes. It is still not clear to what extent <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> is prepared to go to get this
                        support. However, the station and Embassy are urging the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> to retain control of Foreign Affairs,
                        Defense, Interior, the Premiership and Information. The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> leaders are also being urged to get
                        together behind <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> and end
                        bickering and throat cutting. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] Embassy officials and most Belgian advisors agree
                            <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> is probably the only
                            <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> leader able to command sufficient
                        strength to form a government.</p>
                    <p>D. Despite our calls for unity, personal ambition and failure to meet
                        political facts of life continues to dominate developments. For example, <pb n="118" facs="0151" xml:id="pg_118"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BJE_1">Bolikango</persName> appears ready to support
                        Gizenga at the last moment if he thinks such a move would help him achieve
                        his goal of becoming Chief of State. <persName corresp="#p_IJO_1">Ileo</persName> refuses to step down; thereby <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> still is unable to take the
                        necessary negotiating steps preparatory to a parliamentary vote.</p>
                    <p>E. As <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> leaders have done little to
                        convince fence sitters to support the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                        despite our continuing efforts to influence these leaders since the
                        Coquilhatville Conference, our Chief of Station has been attempting to
                        stimulate action by preparing a listing of probable voting positions as well
                        as a listing of parliamentarians who should be developed. This listing has
                        been passed to <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> leaders who are now
                        stirred into action. To support their efforts a total of [<hi rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>] francs has been passed to influence key
                        deputies.</p>

                    <p>In telegram 1638 from Leopoldville to the Central Intelligence Agency, July
                        11, 1961, the Station stated that its greatest problem had been to convince
                        the moderate, anti-<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> leaders
                        supported by <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> of the need to plan and
                        coordinate activities. Partly as a result of its advice, however, this was
                        now being done by an informal coordination and action group composed of
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Joseph Mobutu</persName>, [<hi rend="italic">names not declassified</hi>] had asked for U.S. support of
                        the group’s parliamentary effort, which <pb n="120" facs="0153" xml:id="pg_120"/>was agreed to upon condition that its members maintain
                        a close working relationship with the Station. The chances of the [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] forming a government without
                        Gizenga’s participation were thought to be slim; to offset this, the Station
                        constantly emphasized the importance of the [<hi rend="italic">text not

                    <p>In telegram 1676 from Leopoldville to <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>,
                        July 20, the Station reported that <persName corresp="#p_IJO_1">Joseph
                            Ileo</persName> had refused to resign as Prime Minister in order to
                        permit <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> to form a new
                        government. <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Joseph Kasavubu</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> had agreed that <persName corresp="#p_IJO_1">Ileo</persName> stood little chance of obtaining a
                        majority vote and warned that an <persName corresp="#p_IJO_1">Ileo</persName> failure might well divide the parliamentarians and
                        cause them to turn to Gizenga. It now appeared there would be a “donnybrook”
                        at the parliamentary session at Lovanium, and no one could predict the
                        outcome with certainty. However, the Station continued to believe that the
                            [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] had a good chance of
                        gaining control of the key ministries, including the premiership, of a

                    <p>a. Our Station Chief saw [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] on 23
                        August, at the latter’s request. [<hi rend="italic">name not

                        government concerning pressures from Gizenga on Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>. [<hi rend="italic">name not
                            declassified</hi>] stated that Gizenga continued to demand concessions
                        which would give the Stanleyville forces control of additional key
                        government slots and [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not

                        received a phone call from General Lundula on 21 August. Lundula told
                            <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> that Gizenga demanded
                            <persName corresp="#p_MPI_1">Pierre Mulele</persName> as the Minister of
                        Defense, Lundula to replace <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>

                        Thomas Kanza be named Congolese representative to the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>. When <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> indicated his inability to comply with Gizenga’s
                        demands, Lundula indicated that the Stanleyville population was preventing
                        Gizenga from coming to Leopoldville. [<hi rend="italic">name not
                            declassified</hi>] and presumably <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> interpreted Lundula’s statement to mean that Gizenga
                        would not come to Leopoldville unless his demands for additional key posts
                        were met.</p>
                    <p>b. <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> advised Joseph Kasongo,
                        President of the Chamber, of Gizenga’s demands. [<hi rend="italic">less than

                        Gizenga a letter requesting him to come to Leopoldville at once and
                        indicated that he, Kasongo, would ask Parliament to lift Gizenga’s
                        parliamentary immunity if he refused to comply.</p>
                    <p>(<hi rend="italic">Note:</hi> Our Chief of Station reported the above to Mac

                    <p>c. In addition to Gizenga’s pressures to obtain key jobs, [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] said that the Stanleyville representatives
                        were using other <pb n="125" facs="0158" xml:id="pg_125"/>methods as well to
                        obtain their objectives and he indicated his belief that they would not stop
                        at terrorist methods, if necessary. In the latter connection, noted that
                        Gizenga has received arms shipments and also stated he had information that
                        Gizenga had shipped gold from Stanleyville to Cairo. Under the
                        circumstances, [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] asked our
                        Chief of Station to see <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>
                        shortly in order to advise the latter of the dangers involved in such
                        concessions. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] expressed the

                    <p>In telegram 09810 to Leopoldvlle, September 2, 1961, the Central Intelligence
                        Agency stated that it was very conscious of the fact that the Station had
                        submitted a variety of proposals in recent weeks to which it had received
                        for the most part only a preliminary response. While the <pb n="126" facs="0159" xml:id="pg_126"/><gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                        realized the Congo and long-range planning were a contradiction in terms,
                        such planning was more feasible now than heretofore but Headquarters felt
                        the need for an overall U.S. approach into which to fit the most meaningful
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> role. This had been discussed with
                        newly appointed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GEA_1">Edmund
                            Gullion</persName>, who planned a country team approach to many problems
                        and hoped to return to Washington with firm field recommendations by the end
                        of the year. Headquarters by no means intended to wait that long to
                        undertake a number of new <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> programs but
                        believed the earliest integration of its efforts into more general U.S.
                        thinking was essential. (Central Intelligence Agency Files, Job 78–00435R,

                    <p>In September 1961, fighting between United Nations (<gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>) and Katangan forces entered a new phase. At the end of
                        August, <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> forces seized key points in
                        Elizabethville and arrested a number of Belgian officers and mercenaries. On
                        September 13, a new <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> offensive encountered
                        heavy resistance from European-led Katangan forces. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> and Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> sent a message to Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_GEA_1">Gullion</persName>, instructing him to urge
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold,
                        who was in Leopoldville, to end the fighting and begin negotiations. In the
                        wake of Hammarskjold’s death on September 17 in a plane crash on his way to
                        meet with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, the United States
                        agreed to a <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> request to position four U.S.
                        transport aircraft at Leopoldville for use in an internal airlift of <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> troops within the Congo.</p>
                    <p>On September 19, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName>
                        issued National Security Action Memorandum No. 97, authorizing the dispatch
                        of U.S. fighter aircraft with the necessary logistical support to the Congo,
                        on a contingency basis. <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName>
                        specifically directed that their mission would be to support and defend U.S.
                        and <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> transports or other <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> forces that might come under air attack, and
                        that their use in offensive activities against Katangan forces was not
                        authorized. This authorization would become effective only if no fighter
                        aircraft of other nations were made available to the United Nations. The
                        United Nations obtained fighters elsewhere, however, and the question of
                        using U.S. fighters did not arise again for over a year. See <ref target="frus1961-63v20#d102"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi>

                    <p>1. Summary. Independence in the Congo has resulted in chaos, great
                        difficulties for the West and an opportunity for the Soviet Bloc to exploit
                        the situation to its own ends. The time for ad hoc <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss> action to meet the emergency must
                        now give way to a detailed and organized plan of action which looks beyond
                        today to the eventual form that <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss>
                        wishes to see the future take in the Congo and, for that matter, in Central
                        Africa. This dispatch is an attempt to place on paper certain “talking
                        points” which will serve as a basis for further discussion in the
                        development of such a long-term program of action. Because the need is so
                        great and the problems are so huge, <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> responses and initiatives must likewise be in heroic
                        proportion. Halfway measures will not suffice and there will be no monetary
                        or personnel shortcuts to whatever victory it may be possible to achieve in
                        the Congo over the next several years. The following paragraphs outline a
                        program divided into two arbitrary time phases. In Phase One, we suggest the
                        implementation of operations which (we believe and hope) are within our
                        capacity to accomplish. The accomplishment of Phase Two will require a
                        beefing up of considerable proportions which is beyond our current capacity
                        (both budgetary and personnel). It is our intent to establish an operational
                        framework, wherein boundaries can be established for the future judging of
                        new operations and for the continued <pb n="128" facs="0161" xml:id="pg_128"/>implementation of already-existing operations. Flexibility must be the
                        touchstone of our work, however, since the Congo—as has been seen in the
                        past several months—is capable of infinite changes of direction and
                        varieties of disintegrative forces. The following outline embraces almost
                        all elements of political and psychological action, [<hi rend="italic">4

                    <p>On November 11, 1961, the report of the U.N. Commission established by
                        General Assembly Resolution 1601 (XV), April 15, 1961, to investigate the
                        circumstances of the death of <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Patrice
                            Lumumba</persName> and his colleagues, was signed at Geneva. The
                        Commission accepted as “substantially true” the evidence indicating that
                            <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_OJO_1">Joseph Okito</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_MMA_1">Maurice Mpolo</persName> were killed on January 17,
                        1961, after their arrival at a villa not far from Elizabethville and “in all
                        probability in the presence of high officials of the government of Katanga
                        province, namely Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MGO_1">Munongo</persName>, and Mr. Kibwe.” The
                        Commission stated that President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and his aides, on the one hand, and the Katanga
                        government headed by Moise <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>,
                        on the other, should not escape responsibility for the deaths. <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and his aides had handed the
                        three prisoners over to Katangan authorities, knowing full well that in
                        doing so they were putting them in the hands of their bitterest political
                        enemies. The Katangan government in turn not only did not safeguard the
                        lives of the prisoners, but also by its actions, directly or indirectly,
                        contributed to their murders. (U.N. doc. A/4964)</p>

                        national leader, and of his closest colleagues as a group, in order to endow
                        the <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> Government with
                        sufficient political stability to resist leftist pressures aimed at its
                        overthrow and to bring about a successful, peaceful settlement with the

                        unification under leftist leadership in cooperation with the Soviet Bloc and
                        at the expense of a major United Nations failure.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Facts and Discussion:</hi> The formation of the
                            <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> Government on August 2,
                        1961, following the reconvening of the Congolese Parliament, halted for the
                        moment the strong bid for power by the extremist forces led by
                        Bloc-supported Antoine Gizenga and representing the <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>
                        <hi rend="italic">mystique.</hi> However, the <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> Government contained two major weaknesses: (1)
                        Katanga representatives did not participate in its formation and Katanga’s
                        reintegration into the Congo did not ensue, and (2) Gizenga and a number of
                        his key colleagues obtained important positions in the <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> Government, introducing a
                        disintegrating and irresponsible force. Reintegration of Katanga is
                        necessary for the future economic viability of the Congo, and only peaceful
                        integration can avoid the destruction of Katanga’s economic base and the
                        plunging of the Congo into a chaos from which only the Bloc could profit.
                        Attempts by the United Nations Operation in the Congo (<gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss>) to bring about Katanga reintegration by
                        combined police action and negotiations has met with failure due in large
                        part to the untimely death of Secretary-General Hammarskjold. Pressure on
                            <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to negotiate by the U.S. and other
                        governments has likewise had no success. Popular pressures fanned by the
                        leftists in both Leopoldville and Stanleyville threaten to force the
                            <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> Government either to take
                        all-out military action (almost certain to be abortive) against Katanga or
                        to resign in favor of the extremists, in either of which eventuality we may
                        expect <pb n="131" facs="0164" xml:id="pg_131"/>to see a rapid deterioration
                        of public order and sharply increased influence of the Bloc. This situation
                        has been exacerbated by <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>’s
                        rather colorless and unaggressive personality plus his and his colleagues’
                        absorption with the problems of the daily administration of the government.
                        The extreme opposition, not burdened with responsibility for the success of
                        the government, has been active in undercutting <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>’s position.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Conclusions:</hi> Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> and his close colleagues must
                        obtain in the immediate future new sources of strength and expert political
                        advice if they are to remain in power as a moderating and moderate force.
                        Should the <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> Government be
                        forced to relinquish power or to succumb to extremist policies, the
                        following consequences are likely to ensue quickly: (1) accession by an
                        extremist government committed to a military solution of the Katanga
                        problem, (2) discrediting of the <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss>, (3)
                        a rapid deterioration of internal security leading to chaos, and (4) the
                        ascendency of the Bloc as a major influence in the Congo leading to the
                        possible establishment of a Soviet base of power there.</p>
                    <p>As our Government is committed to the support of <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss>, normal unilateral aid mechanisms are not usable in the
                        Congo. Hence effective measures must be undertaken by covert means.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Action Recommended:</hi> It is recommended that the
                        following actions, which have in substance been proposed jointly by the
                        Chief of Mission and our Leopoldville representative, be authorized to
                        enhance the political image of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> domestically and internationally and to furnish him
                        and his closest collaborators with a base of domestic power sufficiently
                        strong to permit the Government to continue in power as a moderate force,
                        friendly toward the United States, and with the ability to achieve a

                        leading to the eventual forming of a new, cohesive national political party
                        with bases throughout the provinces. Such action, if successful, would
                        assure <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> of Parliamentary

                    <p>2501 (In 28695).</p>
                    <p>1. Since returning from <gloss target="#t_HQS_1">HQS</gloss> [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] struck by apparent nearness of chaos and
                        failure in Congo. The situation is not the result of one or more specific
                        events. Rather there has been a general decline in moderates’ position, a
                        decline which has sharply increased in recent weeks. The <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> govt is in a precarious position as
                        it faces problems with which it does not appear able to cope and to which
                        inadequate solutions have been addressed by the <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss>. Although it would be premature to predict the govt will
                        fall if help not provided rapidly, Leop believes it entirely possible govt
                        will fall or come under control of extremist elements hostile to <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> if overt action is not taken soon to
                        shore up <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>’s position.</p>
                    <p>2. Leop recognizes <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss> is not directly
                        involved, and should not become involved, in formation of policy. Thus, this
                        message is merely for the background use of senior KUBARKers in discussions
                        with <gloss target="#t_ODACID_1">ODACID</gloss>. It represents Station views
                        and was prepared solely on [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>’s]
                        responsibility. It has not been submitted to, nor received approval of,
                        [Embassy] or the country team. In the absence of [Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GEA_1">Gullion</persName>], Station doubts deputy chief
                        [Embassy] would approve such a message. (Thus if info and suggestions
                        reported herein are used, <pb n="133" facs="0166" xml:id="pg_133"/>request
                            <gloss target="#t_HQS_1">HQS</gloss> not indicate origin.) However, Leop
                        believes urgent consideration must be given to new approaches to the Congo
                        problem as considerable risks are entailed in our present policy.
                        Suggestions and comments herein are not intended as a definitive review of
                        Congolese problems or an overall solution. The serious political situation
                        does not permit the time required to conduct detailed studies, and assets to
                        conduct such studies are not available to Leop. However, if <gloss target="#t_HQS_1">HQS</gloss> concurs with Station views that immediate
                        action is required, this message will provide suggestions for overt stopgap
                        measures designed to reverse, or delay, the current trend.</p>
                    <p>3. Prior to independence it was recognized that considerable foreign aid
                        would be required to assist an independent Congo. However, the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> mutiny in July 60 caused <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> and other Western powers to transfer
                        their hopes to an international solution in the form of <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> action. This decision restricted <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> overt efforts in the Congo to the
                        provision of guidance by [Embassy] and a severely limited aid program, thus
                        removing the economic, technical and military programs which might have been
                        used as levers to implement <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss>
                        policy in the Congo. With the exception of the PL 480 agreement signed 18
                        Nov 61, the only unilateral <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss>
                        program in the Congo available for political action purposes was (and is)
                        the <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss> covert action program. In the
                        light of what might have occurred had this weapon not been available, the
                            <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss> program has been relatively
                        successful. <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss> can take major credit
                        for the fall of the <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> govt,
                        the success of the <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> coup and
                        considerable credit for <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>’s
                        nomination as premier. Also, it has achieved a number of other less
                        spectacular but nonetheless important political objectives. Had <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> been able to exploit these openings
                        overtly by means of military, technical or economic aid programs or had the
                            <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> met its responsibilities
                        effectively, <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> policy in the Congo
                        would not now be hanging in the balance. However, <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> was not able to assist overtly
                        persons and govts favorably disposed toward <gloss target="#t_PBPRIME_1">PBPRIME</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> failed
                        to fill the void. Unfortunately, the <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss> action program has not and realistically could never
                        have been expected to be a substitute for a strong and effective govt, nor
                        could it provide the guidance and aid necessary to shore up the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>, retrain the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> and revitalize the economy. Thus, the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>, assisted by the <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss>, has limped along with only partial and inefficient
                        approaches to the enormous problems which it faces.</p>
                    <p>4. The problems of the <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> govt
                        are the same difficulties which have plagued the Congo since independence:
                        lack of discipline within the army, massive unemployment, absence of civic
                        spirit coupled with tribal rivalries, lack of leadership at all levels and
                        lack of preparation for self govt. Although problems facing the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> are innumerable, the following major
                        problems now hold the key to the future of the Congo.</p>
                    <pb n="134" facs="0167" xml:id="pg_134"/>
                    <p>A. The army: The July 60 <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> mutiny which
                        led to the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Congo operation has never been
                        fully contained, as demonstrated by the Jan 61 mutiny in Thysville, the
                        incidents at Kindu, Albertville, Luluabourg, Port Franqui and innumerable
                        lawless acts of troops throughout the Congo, particularly in Orientale and
                        the Kivu. While a part of the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> provided
                        much needed support for the moderates, helped bring down <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> and contributed to maintaining the
                        moderates in power, the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> has remained a
                        problem as well as a support weapon for the moderates. Instead of becoming a
                        strong force for the preservation of law and order, the army has been
                        divided into factions temporarily loyal to its various paymasters (<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and other moderates, the extremists
                        in Kivu and Orientale and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>).
                        It has taken the law into its own hands, arbitrarily arresting Congolese and
                        foreigners, robbing banks and looting. Its untrained officers are not
                        qualified for command or staff positions and have only a minimum of control
                        over their undisciplined troops. In short the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> is little more than an armed mob. However, with the
                        exception of a small-scale paratroop training program which lasted only
                        about two months (42 <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> troopers made a
                        training jump) the <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> has done nothing
                        to meet the key problem of training and reorganizing the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss>. As the result of <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s efforts, the majority of troops
                        in the area responsive to Leopoldville have supported the moderates and this
                        has been a major political lever in maintaining the moderates in power since
                        Sept 60. However, because of its lack of discipline and leadership, the
                            <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> has not provided the support which
                        it might have done if properly organized and trained. Also the danger of the
                        extremists gaining control over the army and using it to gain power remains
                        a potential danger. Finally the fact the army is not under control and must
                        constantly be placated has resulted in large expenditure for the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> (about half the national budget).</p>
                    <p>B. Administrative breakdown: Considerable responsibility for the failure to
                        date of all Congolese govts results from the breakdown of the administrative
                        machinery. Few if any <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> leaders have
                        sufficient admin ability to carry out govt decisions in an efficient manner.
                        Thus the govt machine works only at a small percentage of its potential
                        efficiency. <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> has tried to resolve this
                        problem by assigning technical specialists to various ministries but there
                        are not enough and many are not first-rate types.</p>
                    <p>C. Unemployment: With the departure of many white employers after the July
                        mutiny and the gradual breakdown in govt, the unemployment problem became
                        massive. (No overall unemployment statistics are now available for the
                        Congo. May 61 statistics for Leop showed 52 percent of the male labor force
                        unemployed. [Embassy] believes figures are even higher in provincial
                        cities.) The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> has done little to cope
                        with this problem and <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> efforts in
                        conjunction with <pb n="135" facs="0168" xml:id="pg_135"/>the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> have been limited. As of 31 July 61 (last
                        date for which statistics available to [Embassy], about 160 million <gloss target="#t_BCF_1">BCF</gloss> had been made available by <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> for work relief program. (Bulk of
                        financing came from counterpart value from sale of American food supplies.)
                        Of total sum available, 142 million <gloss target="#t_BCF_1">BCF</gloss> had
                        been allocated for projects throughout the Congo. Thus less than 1 and one
                        half million dollars (at parallel market rate) was allocated for purpose of
                        relief works program by the <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> during
                        its first year in the Congo. As result of confusion in public finances,
                        detailed info re unilateral <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                        expenditures for public works are not available. However, [Embassy] believes
                        such expenditures were minimal. A new joint <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> program is now being
                        developed. However, only 4 <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> officers
                        have been assigned to the program. Even if a program of sufficient magnitude
                        evolves to reduce appreciably the number of unemployed, Leop doubts the
                            <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> will be able provide sufficient
                        qualified administrators and technicians to carry out the program as there
                        are only 450 persons employed by <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss>
                        civil affairs division, including doctors, educators, etc. However, if
                        implementation is left to the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>, its lack
                        of qualified administrators will greatly limit effectiveness of the program,
                        if indeed it does not fail altogether. In summation, Leop believes the
                            <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> has failed to provide a solution
                        or even a partial solution to the unemployment problem, a question with
                        tremendous political as well as economic implications. Also, view quantity
                        and quality of tech advisors available to <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss>, Leop doubts <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> will
                        be able mount an adequate and efficient program.</p>
                    <p>D. Katanga: Although important from an economic viewpoint, the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> desire to reintegrate the Katanga into the
                        Congo has become critical from a political viewpoint. The abortive Sept
                            <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> operation merely succeeded in
                        spotlighting the problem, thus greatly increasing pressures on the <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> govt (from moderates as well as
                        extremists) to find a solution at any cost. <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> was forced to send the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> into Katanga to prevent his govt from falling. The <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> operation failed miserably, further
                        increasing pressures on the govt. The Katanga problem has thus become an
                        emotion charged weapon in the hands of the extremists with which to attack
                        the govt. It could easily bring about the fall of the govt. At present the
                            <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> has reached an impasse. It doubts
                        anything useful will come from negotiations with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> feels he cannot go abroad to meet <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, as he doubts <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s sincerity in offering to
                        negotiate and believes his govt would fall if he undertook such negotiations
                        and failed. (The extremists would almost certainly claim that <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> had sold out to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>.) Also, the failure of the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> Katanga operation has convinced the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> that it cannot, without help, resolve the
                        problem by force. As a result, <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> is desperately casting about for some solution or
                        stop gap measure. Numerous <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> leaders,
                        including [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>], [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] and [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] <pb n="136" facs="0169" xml:id="pg_136"/>and [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                        3</persName>] have requested <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> to
                        provide <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> with planes. <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> has also sent a mission abroad to purchase
                        aircraft. They believe <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> planes would
                        raise the morale of their followers and, at least temporarily, serve as
                        “proof” that the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> is taking positive
                        action to resolve the Katanga problem. To date <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> has rejected Soviet offers of planes, arms and other
                        aid (see Leop 2452) [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>]<note n="2" xml:id="d101fn2">Not found.</note> but he
                        may soon be faced with a choice of his govt falling or accepting Soviet aid
                        to relieve political pressures. In such a case, Leop believes it entirely
                        possible <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> might, against his
                        better judgment, accept the proferred aid, particularly as his govt would
                        almost certainly be replaced by extremists. At present the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> is waiting hopefully for someone to get it
                        off the spot. It hopes the <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> will use
                        force once again and that this time it will be successful in resolving the
                        Katanga question. Also, <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> hopes
                        Balubakat and <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> pressure in north Katanga
                        will put sufficient pressure on <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to bring him back into the Congo fold. However, as
                        it doubtful action in the north Katanga will result in such a solution
                        sufficiently soon, the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> now appears to
                        face the following alternatives: it must obtain strong <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> assistance or it must accept bilateral
                        aid. If the <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> is unable to resolve the
                        Katanga question and if <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>
                        continues to refuse bilateral Soviet aid offers, he will become a sitting
                        political duck. In such a case it is probable his govt would fall (or at the
                        very least be greatly weakened and fall under the influence of the
                        extremists). The resolution of the Katanga problem or early positive steps
                        which point toward its eventual resolution are hurdles which <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> must cross if he is to remain in
                        power. The 24 Nov Security Council resolution<note n="3" xml:id="d101fn3">On
                            November 24, the Security Council passed a resolution completely
                            rejecting the claim that Katanga was “a sovereign independent nation;”
                            deploring Katanga’s secessionist activities and armed action against the
                            United Nations; authorizing vigorous action, including the “requisite
                            measure of force, if necessary,” to secure the immediate withdrawal of
                            all mercenaries and all foreign military and paramilitary personnel and
                            political advisers not under U.N. command; and recognizing the
                            Government of the Congo as exclusively responsible for the conduct of
                            its external affairs. For text, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign
                                Policy: Current Documents,</hi> 1961, pp. 851–852.</note> should
                        provide <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> with respite but if
                        the <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> fails to solve the problem in the
                        near future, extremist pressures will be even greater.</p>
                    <p>E. Gizengist activities: Although no longer as strong as when he headed the
                        Stan regime and claimed to be the legal chief of govt, Gizenga remains a
                        threat. Although probably not a communist, he received bloc and Belgian
                            <gloss target="#t_CP_1">CP</gloss> support in the past and it is
                        probable bloc elements will help him once again if they do not succeed in
                        their efforts to take over or infiltrate the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>. They could thus create another secessionist govt or by
                        supporting him they could contribute to Congo chaos, thus weakening the
                            <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and preparing the way for an
                        eventual <pb n="137" facs="0170" xml:id="pg_137"/>compromise govt which
                        would be more favorable to the bloc. As of now Orientale is in a complete
                        state of anarchy with both govt and business at a standstill. Considerable
                        economic assistance and, possibly, force may be required to resolve this
                        situation. If such help is not forthcoming from the <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> or other outside sources, it is doubtful
                        the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> will be able to solve the problem
                        alone. Gizenga and his active supporters remain a sore in the side of the
                            <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and by their vocal opposition and
                        criticism exercise an influence out of proportion to their actual strength.
                        Through their constant criticism they keep the <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> govt on the defensive and most concessions made to
                        them tend to water down salutary govt programs and actions. If it were not
                        for Katanga and the danger of bloc aid to Gizenga, the latter would not now
                        pose as serious a threat to the govt as is now the case. However, he will
                        remain a serious threat until the Katanga problem is resolved and until the
                            <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> develops a more dynamic
                        program.</p>
                    <p>F. Political frictions within the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>:
                        although <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> received a near
                        unanimous vote of approval at Lovanium, numerous factions exist within the
                        govt. The leaders from Stan and their extremist supporters from other areas
                        remain a constant threat to the govt. The Katanga situation is a political
                        lever in their hands. The extremists tend to neutralize the more
                        conservative elements in the govt. As a result most govt actions are based
                        on compromise or the least common denominator. At present extremist elements
                        are divided by a struggle for power. Interior Minister <persName corresp="#p_GCH_1">Gbenye</persName> and Chamber President Kasongo are
                        fighting for control of the <gloss target="#t_MNC_1">MNC</gloss>/<persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> Party and there is friction
                        between the <gloss target="#t_PSA_1">PSA</gloss> (Gizenga’s party) and the
                            <gloss target="#t_MNC_1">MNC</gloss> over the creation of a new Unified
                        Nationalist Party (Panalu). Both groups want to control the new party, if
                        and when it is formed. Despite current difficulties of the extremists or
                        so-called “nationalists,” they represent a strong force in the country and
                        if they succeed in unifying their efforts under one leader they could become
                        the strongest political force in parliament. At present <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> is forced to depend upon a loose
                        coalition. The moderates have no effective political structure and have
                        continued in power only because the extremists are divided and are not yet
                        ready to make a bid for power. However, should <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> or the <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> fail to
                        solve the Katanga problem, this would provide the extreme nationalists with
                        an opening and a govt less friendly to <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> interests than that of <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> could easily ride to victory. But if the Katanga
                        problem is resolved satisfactorily, the [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not

                            line not declassified</hi>] should provide the moderates with a
                        reasonable chance of success.</p>
                    <p>5. By the foregoing Leop has endeavored to outline several major problems
                        which are threatening the continued existence of a moderate govt in the
                        Congo. We recognize most of these facts and views have <pb n="138" facs="0171" xml:id="pg_138"/>been submitted piecemeal by the Station and
                        [Embassy]. However in view of what appears to be a rapid worsening of the
                        moderates position, the Station feels it incumbent to sum up the situation
                        and to point out that the current <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss>
                        policy in the Congo could easily fail. Although we recognize our Congo
                        policy is only one part of a complicated puzzle, we suggest urgent
                        consideration be given to a review of our present policy and a study of
                        alternative steps. In Leop 1748 [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not

                        have a three to six months period of grace in which to solidify its

                        govt.</p>
                    <p>6. On the basis of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> broadcasts of <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> debates it appears <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> efforts to assist the moderates by
                        means of strengthened <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> action have
                        partially failed. (Leop does not have full details on outcome debate as
                            <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> broadcast faded out at the critical
                        moment.) In view of the fact <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss>
                        efforts have been blocked by the Soviets, Leop suggests <gloss target="#t_HQS_1">HQS</gloss> consider recommending to <gloss target="#t_ODACID_1">ODACID</gloss> that <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> provide aid to the Congo on a unilateral basis, or
                        together with one or more friendly powers. We realize any policy which would
                        result in the withdrawal of all <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss>
                        support for the <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> would not be
                        acceptable but a middle course appears possible. A precedent for bilateral
                        aid agreements has already been set by the signing of the PL 480
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>7. The Station understands that the current <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> policy of working only through the <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> was based on the following
                        considerations:</p>
                    <p>A. To interdict the Congo to the Soviets and to try to avoid exporting the
                        cold war struggle to the Congo.</p>
                    <p>B. To try to avoid ruffling the neutral feathers of the Afro-Asian Bloc.</p>
                    <p>The reasoning which appeared to justify this <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> policy decision when it was first adopted in July 60 no
                        longer appears valid, we have not interdicted the Congo to the Soviets as
                        witnessed by the Soviet <pb n="139" facs="0172" xml:id="pg_139"/>offer to
                        provide arms and other aid on a unilateral basis. Although the cold war in
                        the Congo has not reached the same levels as in Asia, we believe this to be
                        a result more of Soviet difficulties in launching a program in the Congo
                        (great distance from Soviet Union, fact Soviets were expelled from the Congo
                        and were absent for nearly one year, the reservoir of good will toward
                            <gloss target="#t_PBPRIME_1">PBPRIME</gloss> which existed in the Congo,
                        the not altogether fortuitous actions of [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>], etc) than to the fact that <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> abdicated its right to intervene on
                        a unilateral basis. As for the second motive (the sensitivities of the
                        Afro-Asians), Leop recognizes any step by <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> to provide unilateral aid would almost certainly ruffle
                        the neutralists. However the precedent has been set by the PL 480 agreement
                        and it appears probable a sharp break with the neutralists could be avoided
                        if <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> continued its general support
                        for the <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> while instituting certain
                        bilateral programs parallel and complementary to the <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> effort. In any case we may be faced with
                        a choice of accepting bad publicity among the Afro-Asians or seeing the
                        Congo swing into the camp of anti-Western powers, possibly falling under the
                        influence of the bloc. We believe overt unilateral assistance could be
                        limited to the fields of military assistance and public works.</p>
                    <p>8. Most responsible moderate leaders recognize an early solution must be
                        found to the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> problem. This view is
                        shared by [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>], [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>], and [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>], [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 5</persName>], and [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            3</persName>], and [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 4</persName>]
                        and many others. They wish to remove the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> sword of Damocles which hangs over them. Whether <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> would now be prepared to request
                        such assistance if it were not to come through <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> channels is a question which the Station cannot now
                        answer. However if the political situation continues to deteriorate, we
                        suspect he could be convinced to make such a request. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 4</persName>] and [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] have already put out feelers to
                            [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] to determine whether <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> alone or in conjunction with other
                        friendly govts would be willing to take the following steps:</p>
                    <p>A. Provide training outside the Congo for selected <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> officers. (Few if any <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss>
                        officers are adequately trained for their present position. The troops
                        recognize the lack of capacity of the officers. This partially explains the
                        mutinous conduct of the troops and the miserable showing of the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> over the past 16 months.)</p>
                    <p>B. Provide military technicians qualified to give on-the-job training to
                        officers and men who could not be sent abroad. For example, the commander of
                        the paracommando battalion and the troops at Thysville, the only halfway
                        loyal elements available to the govt in the Leopoldville area, could not be
                        spared for training abroad.</p>
                    <p>C. Assist the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> to weed out troublesome
                        and incompetent elements and to train new troops. (Leop doubts it will be
                        possible to do anything with the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> as now
                        constituted. One solution might be to <pb n="140" facs="0173" xml:id="pg_140"/>call up new recruits and train two or more battalions
                        in a training area far from the influence of the present mutinous troops.
                        Once trained the new battalions could replace troops which it would be
                        advisable to eliminate from the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss>. In
                        this fashion it would eventually be possible to create a wholly new army
                        retaining only those officers and men who possess the necessary
                        qualifications and training. In this respect <gloss target="#t_HQS_1">HQS</gloss> should know [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            1</persName>] told [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] on 16 and 26
                        Nov that he eventually hopes to discharge the great majority of present
                            <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> members and that he counts upon
                            <gloss target="#t_PBPRIME_1">PBPRIME</gloss> aid to resettle them in the
                        provinces.</p>
                    <p>D. Provide military equipment to replace matériel which has fallen into
                        disrepair or been destroyed over the past year. (Much <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> equipment is no longer usable because the
                        Congolese through lack of competence or discipline have failed to maintain
                        it properly.)</p>
                    <p>9. In the field of public works <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss>
                        might provide additional administrators and technicians (either on bilateral
                        basis or working through the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>) to
                        supplement those now available to the <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss>. There do not appear to be enough <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> personnel to handle a large public works program and there
                        are few if any Congolese capable of administering such an effort. Also, it
                        may eventually be necessary to provide additional funds (possibly through PL
                        480 channels) if the serious unemployment problem is to be resolved.</p>
                    <p>10. In summation, Leop believes the <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> govt is in serious difficulty and could fall within
                        the next one to three months unless immediate and effective steps are taken
                        to resolve at least one or more of the major problems in the Congo. While
                        Leop recognizes <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> would have little
                        chance of getting the military aid or public works programs suggested herein
                        off the ground in such a short time, the announcement of such plans might
                        serve to extend <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>’s period of
                        grace. <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> could claim to be
                        taking positive steps which would give hope to the unemployed and which
                        might convince the population that the govt would eventually be able to
                        solve the Katanga problem on its own initiative. While on the basis of the
                        24 Nov resolution the <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> may resolve the
                        Katanga problem, Leop is not sanguine. The <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> does not now have sufficient troops in the Congo to launch
                        a military operation in the Katanga and concurrently insure the maintenance
                        of law and order elsewhere in the Congo. Thus, it would appear advisable to
                        take steps ASAP to implement alternative action should the <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> fail or should it appear that its action
                        would come too late. In any case a disciplined and trained army under the
                        control of the moderates would provide them with the force of law and order
                        and with a force which would permit them to resist extremist pressures
                        and/or action against the govt.</p>
                    <p>11. Leop requests <gloss target="#t_HQS_1">HQS</gloss> indulgence for
                        overstepping the limits of its responsibilities by suggesting policy changes
                        in the Congo. However it <pb n="141" facs="0174" xml:id="pg_141"/>wishes to
                        emphasize the urgency which it attaches to the need for taking overt steps
                        to meet the current problem, if <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss>
                        policy objectives are to be achieved. (Such steps cannot be taken by covert
                        means by the Station as now constituted.) We do not wish to imply that all
                        is lost but we wish to alert <gloss target="#t_HQS_1">HQS</gloss> to the
                        fact that the situation in the Congo could and may well go against us. Thus
                        we are forwarding our comments and suggestions for the background use of
                            [<persName corresp="#p_BRM_1">Bissell</persName>] and [<persName corresp="#p_TBR_1">Tweedy</persName>].</p>

                    <p>In telegram 2533 to the Central Intelligence Agency, December 2, 1961, the
                        Chief of Station in Leopoldville reported on a meeting with <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Joseph Mobutu</persName> at which <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> stated that he considered U.S.
                        Congo policy to be “equivocal.” <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> explained that he and many other moderates could not
                        reconcile U.S. clandestine support of the [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not
                            declassified</hi>] with its overt policy of all out support for the
                        United Nations Operations in the Congo. Commenting that he would not have
                        been able to mount his coup on September 14, 1960, or maintain the
                        commissioner form of government in power without U.S. help, he contrasted
                        that assistance with the refusal by the United States to provide the overt
                        support which would have solidified the moderates’ position and avoided the
                        present situation in which the Government of the Congo was dependent upon
                        support of Stanleyville elements. He added that could not understand why the
                        United States continued to funnel all overt aid through the United Nations
                        Operations in the Congo when, in his opinion, the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> supported individuals such as <persName corresp="#p_GCH_1">Christophe Gbenye</persName> who were unfriendly to U.S. policies. He
                        also indicated that he believed the <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss>
                        to be inefficient, noting that it had done nothing to revitalize the economy
                        or assist him in his efforts to reorganize the Congolese National Army. He
                        concluded with an impassioned plea for unilateral U.S. aid to the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>. He insisted that such aid would have the
                        advantage of supporting the [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]
                        and thus permitting them to defeat the more extremist forces and establish a
                        government and policy which in the long run would be more favorable to the
                        United States. (Central Intelligence Agency Files, Job 78–00435R, DDO/ISS

                    <p>2. Insofar as we understand it here, situation as follows:</p>
                    <p>(A) G held Leop under <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> guard at
                            <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> (A) request.</p>

                            guilty. <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Nendaka</persName>, however, had
                            asked if the United States could help them obtain a group of legal
                            specialists to help prosecute the case. (Ibid.) In telegram 2985 from
                            Leopoldville to <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, January 23, the
                            Chief of Station reported that Gizenga had left <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> Headquarters of his own accord and
                            was now established in a house under <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> guard. No incarceration warrant had yet been signed,
                            but Gizenga was for all intents and purposes a prisoner. (Ibid., [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>], Folder 1, Gizenga) See

                    <p>1. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>], called at [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] home shortly before midnight 22 Jan.<note n="2" xml:id="d107fn2">A handwritten notation on the original reads:

                            deeply involved Congo politics involving USA thanks to tie with [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>].”</note> After discussing Gizenga
                        problem he said that although political pendulum currently swinging in favor
                        of the moderates, the great number of unemployed and hungry people
                        throughout the Congo pose a serious problem for the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>. He suggested it would take little to spark a revolt by
                        these people which could result in [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            2</persName>] ouster and Gizenga or some other extremist coming to
                        power. Said he had discussed this problem with [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] and that the latter planned to advise chief
                            <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> of his need for immediate and
                        substantial economic assistance. According to [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>], [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            2</persName>] said <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> must
                        revise its tactics and stop providing economic aid by “eye dropper” methods.
                            [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] insisted immediate
                        major economic aid from <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> is
                        essential if the Congo is not to fall under control of extremists and
                        anti-Western political leaders.</p>
                    <p>2. Although [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] did not have detailed
                        statistics available, he pointed out <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> has provided large amounts of economic aid and that
                        additional funds are in the pipeline. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            1</persName>] seemed to know nothing of this and assumed [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] was referring to funds budgeted for
                            <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> use. He commented that according
                        to Bantu custom when one sees a friend in distress he immediately offers aid
                        and does not wait to be asked for help. He said if the situation became more
                        difficult the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> might take advantage
                        and offer to provide the Congo with large sums of economic aid. He added
                        that Soviet Chargé <persName corresp="#p_PLE_1">Podgornov</persName>
                        recently told [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] funds
                        which the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> normally would have
                        contributed to the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> to pay its share of
                            <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> are now held in Moscow and that
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is prepared to turn these funds
                        over to the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>.<note n="3" xml:id="d107fn3">A handwritten notation on the original reads: “Cynical

                        would be difficult for [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>]
                        to refuse such an offer in view of economic suffering in the Congo.</p>
                    <p>3. [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] again insisted upon the magnitude
                        of <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> economic aid to the Congo and
                        to <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss>. He reminded [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] that, should <pb n="147" facs="0180" xml:id="pg_147"/>the Congo try play off the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PBPRIME_1">PBPRIME</gloss>, it could easily kill the golden egg laying goose. He
                        further reminded [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] that,
                        if <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> ever withdrew its aid from the
                        Congo and/or, <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> would find itself dependent upon and thus
                        under the control of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>4. In discussing <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> aid to the Congo
                            [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] reminded [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] that considerable funds
                        already are on hand and that it is up to the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> to develop and
                        implement plans to launch effective public works projects. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] by his reply indicated his
                        lack of confidence in effective action by <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> and asked why <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss>
                        refuses to provide aid directly to the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>.
                            [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] offered the usual explanation and
                        expressed the belief that [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            2</persName>] would not wish to receive aid which did not pass through
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> channels. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] disagreed, stating he believes
                            [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] would prefer direct
                        aid in matters relating to the internal economy of the Congo. He concluded
                        the meeting by making an impassioned plea for <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> aid to permit the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                        to resolve its grave economic and unemployment problems.</p>
                    <p>5. [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] again saw [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] late 23 Jan. He provided
                            [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] with a detailed
                        statement concerning <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> aid which
                            <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> has given or will provide
                        during <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 62. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] was surprised by the sums involved and stated he
                        would write memo to [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] on
                        the subject.</p>
                    <p>6. [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] again questioned [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] relative to the latter’s
                        belief that [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] wants
                        direct <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> aid, rather than aid
                        through <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> channels. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] admitted [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] had never actually made such a
                        statement but said he had interpreted [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            2</persName>] comments in this light. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] expressed the view that, if all aid must be
                        passed through <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> channels, the Congo
                        has lost its sovereign status and should be considered a <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> protectorate. Referring to the original
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> mandate to preserve peace and order,
                            [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] said he understands
                        all efforts in this direction must be channelled through <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss>. However as a sovereign state, he
                        believes Congo should be able to deal with any nation on matters relating
                        directly to its economy or other internal problems. (Note: This view is
                        shared by [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] who is
                        disenchanted with <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> because of among
                        other things, <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss>’s failure to take
                        positive steps to reorganize the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss>.
                            [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] has become extremely
                        bitter and is convinced the Congo must look elsewhere for aid and guidance
                        if the army is ever to be brought in hand.) Referring to <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss>’s failure to develop and implement an
                        adequate public works program and its failure to do any thing to resolve the
                        problem of the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss>, the problem which first
                        brought <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> to the Congo, [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] urged [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] to bring immediately to the attention of
                            <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> the dire need of the Congo
                        for financial aid, as well as guidance in other fields. He concluded by
                        expressing the view that <pb n="148" facs="0181" xml:id="pg_148"/><gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> efforts and actions are often in direct
                        contradiction to <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> policy and to
                        the best interests of the Congolese people. He further stated that if <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> continued to place all its Congo
                        bets on <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> it might well wake up to find
                        this policy had undermined <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> elements
                        favorable to the West and resulted in failure, insofar as <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> objectives are concerned.</p>
                    <p>7. [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] showed above message in memo form
                        to [Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GEA_1">Gullion</persName>] 24 Jan.
                        Latter was annoyed by content and took position he wished use memo to rub
                        noses [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] and [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] <gloss target="#t_reps_1">reps</gloss> in fact that <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss>
                        aid not receiving adequate publicity.</p>
                    <p>8. Although recognize <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> can never
                        satisfactorily resolve Congo problem Leop interpretation [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] statements quite different
                        than that of [<persName corresp="#p_GEA_1">Gullion</persName>]. Believe as
                        previously reported Leop 2501 (In 28695)<note n="4" xml:id="d107fn4"><ref target="#d101">Document 101</ref>.</note> that <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> failure launch adequate public works
                        program to at least partially resolve disasterous unemployment situation
                        involves great hazards for <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> Congo
                        policy. In short, Leop does not believe <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> is doing adequate job on either military or economic
                        front. With Linner, General Maceoin and other senior <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> officers scheduled leave Congo near
                        future, <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> High Command appears be
                        taking even more relaxed attitude than usual. While may be in Cassandra-like
                        mood, cannot help being concerned by <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> failure take all possible steps avoid failure in Congo.
                        Thus Station taking liberty forwarding above message on eyes only basis for
                            [<persName corresp="#p_BRM_1">Bissell</persName>] and [<persName corresp="#p_TBR_1">Tweedy</persName>] in hope that concern expressed by
                            [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] may be brought to
                        the attention of appropriate <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss>
                        authorities. For obvious reasons Leop not advising [<persName corresp="#p_GEA_1">Gullion</persName>] it transmitting this
                            message.<note n="5" xml:id="d107fn5">In <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> telegram 38458 to Leopoldville, January 30, <persName corresp="#p_TBR_1">Tweedy</persName> advised the Chief of Station
                            that assessment of the request needed to be ironed out locally if at all
                            possible with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GEA_1">Gullion</persName>, since this involved a policy decision in which the
                            Agency could play only a minor role. Whether U.S. aid should be greatly
                            increased would presumably be the product of the Ambassador’s
                            recommendation, to which <persName corresp="#p_DLA_1">Devlin</persName>
                            could contribute, and a U.S. Government policy decision. (Central

                    <p>In telegram 39667 to the Station in Leopoldville, February 3, 1962, the
                        Central Intelligence Agency reported that during a meeting on February 1
                        with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GEA_1">Gullion</persName> he had
                        raised with <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> the question of the removal
                        of Antoine Gizenga from the Congo. <persName corresp="#p_GEA_1">Gullion</persName> was apprehensive that the pressure to see that no
                        harm came to Gizenga may have gone too far and that there was a danger he
                        might even be released from custody and could thereupon assemble some
                        support. It was generally agreed that any movement if not done by force
                        would require causing Gizenga to fear for his life if he remained in the
                        Congo. (Central Intelligence Agency Files, [<hi rend="italic">text not
                            declassified</hi>], Folder 1, Gizenga)</p>
                    <p>Responding in telegram 3096, February 6, Leopoldville reported that Gizenga
                        was now a prisoner on the island of Boulabemba, a move that appeared to have
                        created furor in certain United Nations Operations in the Congo circles.
                        While concurring that it would be advisable to get Gizenga out of the
                        country, the Station warned that this would provide no guarantee he would
                        not return if and when the moment appeared appropriate and once current
                        charges against him had died down. The Station preferred to see him charged
                        with revolt and other crimes, though there was no way of being sure that he
                        would be convicted and sentenced, and if he “were tried and acquitted it
                        would be serious blow for [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not
                        declassified</hi>] and would mean that he would soon be back in parliament
                        and perhaps in the govt where he would be in a position to work from
                        within.” Efforts to obtain information from the Government of the Congo had
                        produced nothing definite other than the fact that Gizenga had been
                        transferred to Moanda where, according to <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Victor Nendaka</persName>, he was to be held until a judicial
                        investigation preliminary to his trial was completed. (Ibid.)</p>

                    <p>In telegram 3100 to the Central Intelligence Agency, February 5, 1962, the
                        Station in Leopoldville reported that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Joseph
                            Mobutu</persName> had asked for financial aid, stating that he
                        particularly needed funds now to try to win back Congolese National Army
                        elements which were previously loyal to Antoine Gizenga and the Stanleyville
                        regime. In requesting aid, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                        expressed embarrassment at constantly having to seek aid for various
                        projects but added that he believed he would <pb n="150" facs="0183" xml:id="pg_150"/>need aid on a continuing basis. The Station expressed
                        its belief that <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> should continue to
                        subsidize <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> as he remained “our
                        anchor to windward” in the implementation of [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym

                        Job 78–00435R, DDO/ISS Files, Box 1, Folder 9, [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym
                            not declassified</hi>] Operations) The <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> authorized the expenditure in telegram 40969 to
                        Leopoldville, February 9. (Ibid.)</p>
                    <p>In telegram 3220 to the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, February 24,
                        1962, Leopoldville reported that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> had requested financial support in connection with
                        the military operation now launched against North Katanga. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> was not happy about the situation,
                        the Station commented, but he had no alternative other than to try his best
                        with an army that was poorly officered, poorly trained, and badly organized.
                        If <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> failed he would be wide
                        open for attack by extremist enemies, as would be the <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> government. It had also been
                        learned from <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Justin Bomboko</persName> that the
                        government intended to take over North Katanga administratively as well as
                        militarily. <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> was scheduled to
                        visit the area soon in order to show the flag and set up an administration
                        loyal to Leopoldville. In short, the Station stated, the government was
                        wagering its existence on the North Katanga operation. Despite strong
                        reservations about the advisability of the operation, the Station strongly
                        recommended supporting <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>.

                        February 25, authorized the expenditure, on the assumption that it had been
                        discussed with the Ambassador. (Ibid.)</p>

                    <p>1. Per Refs A and B believe current political situation requires contingency
                        planning. Although do not consider it probable govt will fall or army
                        revolt, this remains real possibility. Much depends upon how [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] handles himself on his return

                        April on T departure. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>]
                        and [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] said 20 April that
                        unpopular <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> members, particularly
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJE_1">Bolikango</persName>, appeared be taking
                        rap and only limited criticism levelled at [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>]. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity

                        in and [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] still not
                        completely out of woods.</p>
                    <p>4. During morning session 20 April, censure motion voted against Finance
                        Minister Arthur Pinzi. Justice Minister Remy Mwamba appears be next on list.
                            [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] said he believes
                            [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] probably will face
                        censure motion and may well fall. However, [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] says he not aware such possibility. (See [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] and [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]<note n="5" xml:id="d114fn5">Neither found.</note> for reports predicting

                        ministers to go, he has many enemies as result fact he long in office and

                        appears parliament has bit in mouth and possibility attempt overthrow govt
                        cannot be eliminated.</p>
                    <p>5. Leop would appreciate <gloss target="#t_HQS_1">HQS</gloss> guidance re
                        line to take if one of combination of following possible developments
                        occur:</p>
                    <p>A. Possibility [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] may have
                        to put down parliamentary rebellion. (This could involve payments to
                        parliamentarians, revision of govt, concessions of all sorts to opposition
                        leaders, etc.)</p>
                    <p>B. Possibility opposition may submit censure vote against [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>]. (In such case [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] would require large
                        financial support in order buy sufficient votes try guarantee majority
                        support for [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>].)</p>
                    <p>C. Possibility govt may fall and relative moderate (portion garbled-being
                        serviced) man who not known be member Leop or Stan groups will emerge as
                        candidate for premiership.</p>
                    <p>D. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] fall and extremist
                        such as [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] or one of their
                        followers selected form new govt.</p>
                    <p>E. Possibility [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] may
                        require <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> support remain in office. (For
                        example, [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] might be
                        forced establish military regime, sending parliament home or making it a
                        rubber stamp.)</p>
                    <p>F. Possibility <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> revolt.</p>
                    <p>6. Neither Station nor [Embassy] happy with [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>]. He started well but has bungled badly lately.
                        Also Leop has for some time toyed with view outlined para 3, Dir 04749 (Out
                            73718)<note n="7" xml:id="d114fn7">Possible that <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> sees some merit in Soviet

                        subject being forwarded separate cable.) [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] was never Station’s favorite candidate but view
                        alternatives we were forced back him. Unfortunately, this continues be the
                        case. Few if any moderates could obtain sufficient votes replace him. Thus,
                        alternatives probably would be selection of extremist with consequent danger
                        of <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> coup per para 11 or parliament would
                        not be able select successor. This would create power vacuum and open way to

                    <p>B. Pressure <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and US give him stronger
                        support in terms real or implied threat to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> by threatening seek Afro Asian or bloc support or by
                        threat resign in favor radicals. This course likely.</p>
                    <p>C. Actually turn to Afro Asians or bloc for support. Could inadvertently

                    <p>D. Withdraw and try isolate Congo from other foreign influence. This

                            plan. The Chief of Station told him he thought the current regime was
                            doomed unless it achieved results on the economic level and instituted a
                            program of political solidarity. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity

                            goal, but he could not launch such a program until the budget was voted.
                            When queried regarding the possibility of attempting to create a
                            political party based on key political leaders from each province,
                                [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] said that was
                            already his plan. He asked the Chief of Station if he could count on
                            U.S. support, to which the former replied that he thought the United

                            obtaining a stable government and guaranteed financial control of
                            expenditures. The meeting terminated with [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] promise to come up with his own

                    <p>1. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] called [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] his home [<hi rend="italic">less than 1

                        new party. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] explained
                        that he and other [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>]
                        believe <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> has accomplished more in
                        the Congo than could have been expected in that it succeeded in torpedoing
                            [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 3</persName>] preventing
                            [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 4</persName>] or [Identity <pb n="162" facs="0195" xml:id="pg_162"/>5] from obtaining control <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and assisted in establishing [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] regime. He said [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] understand reasons behind
                            <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> actions, i.e., that <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> did not wish an unfriendly and pro
                        bloc regime in the Congo. However he added that [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym
                            not declassified</hi>] concerned by possibility <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> might now or later switch its
                        support to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> (T).</p>
                    <p>2. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] said T popularity is
                        on upswing within Congo and T may go for brass ring and try become premier
                        or president. In such case [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            1</persName>] said he could understand <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> might prefer T to [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            2</persName>] view fact both T and [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] anti Communists. Added support of T might
                        facilitate things for Chief <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> in
                        that T appears be fair haired boy more conservative members Congress.
                            [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] concluded by saying
                        he and most [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] strongly
                        favor effort work with <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> but before
                        advising [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] he needed some
                        assurance from [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] that <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> would not turn against [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] and favor T.</p>
                    <p>3. When [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] expressed surprise that [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] could suspect such change
                        in <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> policy, [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] outlined following points as
                        apparently substantiating such possibility:</p>
                    <p>A. [Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TCH_1">Timberlake</persName>] recalled
                        and replaced by [<persName corresp="#p_GEA_1">Gullion</persName>] despite
                        fact <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> fully aware [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] preferred [<persName corresp="#p_TCH_1">Timberlake</persName>].</p>
                    <p>B. Conservative congressional leaders have expressed approval of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and have been critical of
                            [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] and some of his
                        supporters. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] opined
                        Chief <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> might find it convenient
                        for internal political reasons sacrifice [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>].</p>
                    <p>C. Station has recently cracked down on financial support at time [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] in trouble.</p>
                    <p>4. [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] endeavored reassure [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>]. Held long meeting with him
                        night 10 May and again on morning 12 May. Explained need for tightened
                        financial strings. Pointed out that Station had accepted unorthodox funding
                        methods during continued Congo crisis but explained that neither Station nor
                            <gloss target="#t_HQS_1">HQS</gloss> believes vote buying to be more
                        than interim step. Assured [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            1</persName>] that continued <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss>
                        support would be forthcoming, probably even including use of some bribe
                        money, if the [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] were
                        concurrently endeavoring establish a more permanent organizational solution
                        (a national political party).</p>
                    <p>5. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 6</persName>] raised similar
                        problem with [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] 11 and 12 May. [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] used same arguments in replying.</p>
                    <p>6. At 12 May meeting [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>]
                        told [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] he had recommended [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] make every effort comply with
                        Station recommendations and begin organizational efforts ASAP.</p>
                    <pb n="163" facs="0196" xml:id="pg_163"/>
                    <p>7. Following are Station comments on Reference A:</p>
                    <p>A. While concur [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] should
                        provide his own plan, it Station and [Embassy] experience that to get things
                        done in Congo it advisable do as much as possible oneself. Certainly any
                        final program must be worked out by [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not
                            declassified</hi>] but to be realistic believe Station must make some
                        contribution.</p>
                    <p>B. Leop not sanguine re possibility removing Congolese venality by means
                        school or seminar for leaders. As in most backward areas which do not have
                        civic traditions, suspect venal motivation will remain for many

                    <p>4382 (In 34960). 1. In two separate sessions 24 July [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] expounded [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] proposal for creation
                        political party to support [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not
                            declassified</hi>] and requested 1.8 million <gloss target="#t_BCF_1">BCF</gloss> toward this effort.</p>
                    <p>2. Core of proposed party would be 40 tribal chiefs who members parliament
                        and with whom [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] feels he
                        on excellent terms. ([<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] knows
                        background.) <gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss>: Chiefs and [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] participated formal ceremony
                        23 June at [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 3</persName>] residence
                        during which chiefs pledged “everlasting loyalty” to [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 3</persName>] and [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>]. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] thus believes this best psychological moment to
                        launch proposed party.</p>
                    <p>3. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] states [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] convinced that to weather
                        parliamentary impetuosities, erratic political behavior which bound
                        continue, party must have broadest possible base and be as completely
                        interwoven as possible in fabric of lives of Congolese masses. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] equally convinced that
                        essentially moderate, traditionalist, tribally-oriented party is only one
                        which can fill this bill. Thus to him party of tribal chiefs is only
                        feasible approach.</p>
                    <p>4. In response query whether proposed party—which would probably become known
                        as “traditionalist”—could withstand strains such current issues as
                        leftist-oppositionist maneuvering and creation new provinces, [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] stated [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] believes only party such as
                        one proposed would have sufficiently solid footing avoid being swept away by
                        political caprices and crises of moment. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] said that among majority non-urbanized masses
                        extremists-oppositionists can make significant headway only by railing
                        against tribal chiefs—a tactic which for considerable time to come cannot
                        possibly succeed. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] added
                        that majority those parliamentarians who now afraid return to home districts
                        (see [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>])<note n="2" xml:id="d118fn2">Not found.</note> are oppositionist, or at least
                        non-tribal politicos. On new provinces question, [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] said [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] readily admits such issue
                        bound create certain tribal frictions, but believes these disputes can be
                        far more easily resolved within same party than among number of
                        factions.</p>
                    <pb n="165" facs="0198" xml:id="pg_165"/>
                    <p>5. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] added [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] argument that in extreme event
                        parliament ever became “ineffective”, proposed party could “stand in” as
                        representative body reflecting will of people. He emphasized this only last
                        resort to be considered when all else fails.</p>
                    <p>6. Proposed sum would be spent to establish national party <gloss target="#t_HQS_1">HQS</gloss> Leop and small offices in each chief’s
                        home town, and to enable chiefs to conduct membership drives in their
                        respective areas.</p>
                    <p>7. In answer request, Leop said only that idea sounded sensible, but would of
                        course have to consider it before making decision. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] then requested answer ASAP
                        since [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] wishes get
                        machinery in motion before chiefs begin returning home at impending close
                        parliamentary session. Also stated that if total sum not immediately
                        available, would welcome half now, half shortly thereafter.</p>
                    <p>8. In further discussion proposed party and its place in context <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                        objectives, [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] stated
                            [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] fed up with
                        parliamentary bribing as method remaining in power, particularly since many
                        parliamentarians appear create trouble whenever they need money. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] convinced proposed party can
                        reduce or eliminate need continuance this practice. Leop said <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> agreed completely on futility
                        continued bribing and therefore welcomed proposals for creation sound [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] base. At same time, Leop
                        creation [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] political
                        party only one of many problems facing Congo, and no party however strong
                        can support indefinitely govt which people feel is insufficiently active.
                            [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] said [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] agreed completely, and
                        hoped creation [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] party
                        would remove <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> handicap of having operate
                        in perpetual aura of compromise.</p>
                    <p>9. While Leop under no illusions proposed party will become greatest
                        political org since Tammany, must admit essential soundness [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] ideas convincing and prospect
                        of solid action attractive. Experience here seems have shown futility
                        attempting mould and hold together any purely political grouping (i.e. not
                        based on tribal lines) over any appreciable time span. Thus [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] party to be founded on other
                        than somewhat abstract (to Congolese) politico-social ideals would seem have
                        considerably better chance success than previous attempts. Two hindrances to
                        success proposed party appear possible: trend of rural to urban migration,
                        and fact that cities often centers of political effervescence. Impact of
                        such migration however usually long range, not immediate and Congolese
                        would-be politicos continue attempt draw support from countryside—even in
                        Stey—thus acknowledging importance rural political sentiment. Chances
                        probably less than even that urban politicos would attempt fly in face
                        chiefs in surrounding countryside, particularly if these chiefs enjoyed
                        support <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>.</p>
                    <pb n="166" facs="0199" xml:id="pg_166"/>
                    <p>10. Thus after careful consideration all factors here, Leop recommends
                        approval pass [<hi rend="italic">monetary amount not declassified</hi>] to
                            [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] for establishment
                        proposed party. Party may not be final solution to political stabilization
                            [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] but to Leop it
                        appears decided step forward with very good chance making significant
                        contribution to achievement <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss>
                        objectives Congo.</p>
                    <p>11. Still believe eventual [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not

                        (labor) support for maximum mass action. In this line, see Leop 4380 (In

                    <p>A. Discussion: Although the Congo is beset with many pressing problems, the
                        issue of reintegrating Katanga Province is emotionally foremost and takes
                        precedence over all others in the minds of virtually all Congolese
                        politicians. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>
                        came to office nearly a year ago with a mandate to solve the Katanga problem
                        as his primary task. A <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> military
                        operation in September 1961 and Congolese National Army (<gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss>) efforts in October and November failed in
                        this purpose; <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss>’s “Round Two” in
                        December was inconclusive. Since then, beginning with the Kitona meeting,
                            <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> have held a series of negotiations
                        leading to no agreement; these broke off in late June 1962. With each
                        failure of solution, left extremists have been emboldened to take action

                    <p>(7) The U.S. must be prepared to continue relatively large covert

                        Although only a stop-gap effort, I am convinced that there is no
                        alternative, as a long-range political action program cannot be implemented
                        as long as key leaders are concentrating all attention on Katanga. Also,
                        Leopoldville Station lacks sufficient staff/contract personnel to implement

                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Long-term Problem</hi></p>
                    <p>A. Discussion: Prior to independence, it was recognized that Congo would need
                        considerable foreign aid. But the mutiny of the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> caused the U.S. to channel all aid (with minor exceptions)
                        through the U.N. As a result, Agency covert action has furnished the U.S.
                        with its only instrument for unilateral action in the Congo. The Agency’s
                        actions have been relatively successful; we can claim major credit for
                            <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>’s overthrow, the success
                        of the <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> coup, and for
                            <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>’s nomination and the
                        survival of his government to date. Had the U.S. been able to exploit
                        Agency-created opportunities through overt military, technical or economic
                        aid programs (or had <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> met its
                        responsibilities effectively), U.S. policy would not now be hanging in the
                        balance. In addition to Katanga, the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                        faces the following major long-term problems:</p>
                    <p>(1) The <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss>: The 1960 <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> mutiny has never been fully contained.
                            <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> lacks a trained cadre and adequate
                        supplies. The U.N. has done nothing to resolve this problem and will not do
                        so as long as officers unfriendly to the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> are in charge of U.N. military efforts in the Congo. (<hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_AF_1">AF</gloss> Comment:</hi> Some
                        three months ago, the U.N. offered a military training team and sent it to
                        Leopoldville, but General <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                        seems to have remained convinced that the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> is quite all right as it is. The U.N. training team finally
                        left, lacking employment. As noted above, <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> has this problem under urgent consideration.)</p>
                    <pb n="170" facs="0203" xml:id="pg_170"/>
                    <p>(2) Administrative Breakdown: Few <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                        officials have the training or ability to carry out government decisions
                        effectively. <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> technical advisors
                        assigned to various <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> ministries are too
                        few in number and many are not competent. (<hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_AF_1">AF</gloss> Comment:</hi> Contributing to
                        administrative confusion is the running fight between U.N. technicians and
                        Belgians hired by the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>.)</p>
                    <p>(3) Unemployment: With the departure of many Belgian employers in July 1960
                        and the gradual breakdown of government administration, unemployment rose to
                        52% of the male labor force in Leopoldville by May 1961; it is probably even
                        higher now, and may be higher still in provincial cities. A problem of
                        tremendous political import, neither the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> nor the U.N. has been able to take effective measures. (<hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_AF_1">AF</gloss> Comment:</hi> Although
                        relief and stop-gap measures can and should be taken, the problem basically

                        the belief that the problem is distribution rather than production per
                        se.)</p>
                    <p>B. Recommendations: The U.S. Government should recognize that the policy of
                        channeling all efforts through the U.N. is not the reason for Soviet
                        difficulties in launching a program in the Congo, and that unilateral U.S.
                        aid to the Congo under a U.N. umbrella would not be objectionable to the
                        Afro-Asians if it contributed to reducing the Katanga secession and
                        restoring order to the Congo. Therefore, the U.S. should, with other
                        friendly governments undertake the following steps, with tacit U.N.
                        concurrence.</p>
                    <p>(1) Provide training outside of the Congo for selected <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> officers. Until effective cadres control
                        the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss>, it will not be an effective force
                        or a support for moderate political elements. (<hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_AF_1">AF</gloss> Comment:</hi> As noted above, <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> is looking into <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> training. Belgium is willing to undertake additional

                        accepted recent offers.)</p>
                    <p>(2) Provide a small number of military technicians for training of officers
                        and men in the Congo.</p>
                    <p>(3) Provide military equipment to replace material destroyed or in disrepair.

                        <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> is willing to recommend this as soon as
                        it has assurances that <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> personnel can
                        use and maintain it.)</p>
                    <p>(4) Provide public works administrators and technicians to supplement <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> personnel. (<hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_AF_1">AF</gloss> Comment:</hi> This is a complicated

                        political difficulties. Its fall might spell failure of U.S. policy in the
                        Congo. Should it survive, both it and the U.S. must be content with only
                        partial successes unless U.S. policy is changed to permit overt unilateral
                        assistance in key areas. Lacking such a change, the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> must continue to depend upon the compromise-prone and

                        aid in solving its problems. Lacking such aid in the form of a strong,
                        unilateral ally, and lacking solid and effective programs on which to base
                        actions, they believe their regime may well fall and be replaced by the sort
                        of extremist-nationalist regime which has appeared elsewhere in Africa. This
                        would destroy the strategic advantage the U.S. enjoys in the Congo today.
                        The moderate leaders around <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>
                        do not understand, therefore, why the U.S. withholds unilateral
                        assistance.</p>
                    <p>C. Should the Congo fall into the hands of extremists, which is likely unless
                        the moderates provide effective solutions, neighboring areas such as Angola,
                        Congo (Brazzaville), the Central African Republic, Sudan, Uganda, Kenya,
                        Tanganyika, Rwanda, Burundi, and the Rhodesias would become vulnerable to
                        Bloc penetration through subversive penetration from the Congo. Also,
                        political leaders in these countries, observing the failure of the West to
                        support friendly governments, might be expected to seek accommodation with
                        the Bloc and with internal extremist elements.</p>

                    <p>Telegram 4662 from Leopoldville to the Central Intelligence Agency, August
                        30, 1962, reported that <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Justin
                            Bomboko</persName> had discussed the development of new provinces in the
                        Congo with the Chief of Station on August 30, emphasizing that considerable
                        political jockeying was now going on to gain control of them and requesting
                        substantial aid to insure continuation of his influence and that of other
                            [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>]. The Station
                        strongly recommended providing support, pointing out that if the [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] did not have control of
                        their home provinces, they could easily lose their government jobs in
                        Leopoldville. Also the new constitution had to be ratified by a majority of
                        the new provinces prior to its final adoption. Thus, control over the new
                        provinces was important for overall U.S. objectives as well as specific [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] objectives. The cable
                        noted that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GEA_1">Gullion</persName>
                        concurred with this request. (Central Intelligence Agency Files, Job

                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> responded in telegram 33362, August
                        31, that it considered funding for such purposes valid but premature, in
                        that creation of new provinces required parliamentary action and parliament
                        was now recessed. (Ibid.) Leopoldville advised Headquarters in telegram
                        4676, August 31, that its information on the timing of formation of the new
                        provinces was not correct. Parliament had already approved many new
                        provinces; most provincial governments would be formed within the next few
                        weeks; and the campaign period for formation of the new provincial
                        governments was already in full swing. The cable reiterated that if the [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] did not have control of
                        their home provinces, they could easily be eliminated from the Leopoldville
                        scene, thus jeopardizing the entire political edifice on which U.S. Congo
                            <pb n="173" facs="0206" xml:id="pg_173"/>policy rested. The Station
                        recognized and shared Headquarters’ frustrations as a result of continued
                        spending requests to shore up the [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not
                            declassified</hi>]. “However, believe we must be realistic and recognize
                        this as fact of life in Congo. There just is no easy and rapid solution to
                        the Congo problem.” (Ibid.) <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> telegram
                        33690 to Leopoldville, September 1, approved funding. (Ibid.)</p>

                    <p>In telegram 4871 to the Central Intelligence Agency, September 28, 1962, the
                        Station in Leopoldville reported that in both its own and the Embassy’s
                        opinion, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Joseph Mobutu</persName> remained the
                        most effective Congolese National Army officer and key figure on the
                        political scene. Based on numerous discussions with attachés and others, the
                        Station did not believe there was any other <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> officer on the horizon with the political and military
                        qualifications to replace <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>.
                        Although he was not as effective as Leopoldville would like, he remained the
                        only available asset to control the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss>. If
                        his position fell to someone else this could easily terminate the [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] program. In view of the
                        continued critical political situation and the possibility of a [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] coup, the Station
                        recommended continuing support for <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss>, noting
                        that it did not believe the <persName corresp="#p_GML_1">Greene</persName>

                        altered the situation. To date the only steps taken to implement the report,
                        the Station commented, were an invitation for <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> to visit the United States and one “impact shipment”
                        which Leopoldville understood was on its way. (Central Intelligence Agency

                        headway over the past 6 months in extending and strengthening their
                        influence. The political control of <gloss target="#t_MNC_1">MNC</gloss>/L
                        extremists has been broken in Orientale (the last of the extremist office

                        of the Kasai and Kivu have been weakened if not fully eliminated. Despite
                        these plus factors, the Congo is again heading into a serious political
                        crisis, a crisis which stems largely from the failure of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> to implement its much publicized
                        reconciliation plan. It has been nearly 8 weeks since <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> accepted the plan (with
                        qualifications) but it has yet to be implemented. Opposition elements within

                            [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] suggested that if

                    <p>In an October 27, 1962, telegram to the Central Intelligence Agency, the
                        Station in Leopoldville proposed that the U.S. Government covertly arrange
                        to provide the Government of the Congo with the services of five pilots. The
                        proposal was submitted in response to a Department of State telegram
                        indicating that the Department was searching for a crash action program
                        which the U.S. Government could take prior to the November 5 meeting of
                        parliament to shore up Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>’s position. The Congolese Government had five Harvard
                        trainer aircraft and four transport aircraft but no pilots, the Station
                        noted. If pilots could be made available to the Congolese Government prior
                        to November 5 it would give <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> a
                        psychological and political lift out of all the proportion to the military
                        value of the aircraft. The proposal was discussed at a meeting of <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and Department of State representatives on
                        October 29. <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> informed the Department
                        that the most readily available pilots were refugee [<hi rend="italic">less
                            than 1 line not declassified</hi>] In an October 29 memorandum, Joseph
                        W. Scott of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research briefed Deputy Under
                        Secretary of State for Political Affairs <persName corresp="#p_MGC_1">McGhee
                            George </persName> on the proposal and recommended that he approve the
                        Department’s concurrence in its implementation. (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_INR_1">INR</gloss>/IL Historical Files, Congo, Sept.
                        1962–Dec. 1963)</p>
                    <p>The Department informed <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> of its
                        concurrence in an October 31 memorandum and added that its understanding was
                        that <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> would handle the matter in such a
                        way that only <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Joseph Mobutu</persName> would know of the U.S.
                        Government’s role. (Ibid.) On November 2 the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> notified State that it was proceeding with implementation
                        on an urgent basis, but indicated that although <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> would make every effort to confine knowledge of the U.S.
                        role to <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, there could be no assurances that
                        they would not inform other Congolese. (Ibid.)</p>
                    <p>Three and a half weeks later, in a November 26 memorandum, Scott informed U.
                        Alexis <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>, Under Secretary of
                        State for Political Affairs, that the Congolese Government now desired to
                        use the pilots for reconnaissance and combat missions in North Katanga.
                        Scott indicated, however, that according to the Agency there were urgent
                        problems of personnel and supply augmentation which must be met before the
                        pilots and the Congolese Government aircraft would have the capability to
                        fly missions outside the immediate area of Leopoldville. In view of the
                        possible financial magnitude of a program giving the Congolese Air Force a
                        combat capability and the possibility that Department of Defense equipment
                        and funds might be required, it appeared to Scott that the proposal should
                        go the Special Group. <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>
                        <pb n="177" facs="0210" xml:id="pg_177"/>approved his recommendation that he
                        ask <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> to prepare a proposal for the
                        Special Group’s consideration. (Ibid.)</p>

                            such training. It will provide the nucleus for a Congolese force to be

                    <p>1. This memorandum is forwarded for your use as background in the
                        presentation of attached memorandum<note n="2" xml:id="d125fn2">Dated
                            November 16, attached but not printed.</note> for Special Group.</p>
                    <p>2. The attached memorandum proposes that this Agency undertake the
                        organization, training, and, to some extent, the equipping of an airborne
                            company<note n="3" xml:id="d125fn3">At this point “125 men” is written
                            in an unidentified hand.</note> of Congolese gendarmes for the purpose
                        of providing a stopgap internal security and counter-insurgency striking
                        force during the interim between the phaseout of U.N. troops and the
                        long-range training of regular Congo National Army troops. It would also
                        provide an unconventional warfare capability in the event of communist
                        take-over of all or part of the Congo. First year costs would be about [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>]. Subsequent annual
                        costs should be half that amount.</p>
                    <p>3. On 6 November 1962, the Department of State submitted a contingency plan
                        for the Congo<note n="4" xml:id="d125fn4">See <ref target="frus1961-63v20#d323fn5">footnote 5 to Document 323</ref> and

                                Crisis</ref>.</note> which recommended, among other items, that the
                        U.S. undertake the training of an airborne gendarmerie unit. <pb n="178" facs="0211" xml:id="pg_178"/>The President approved this plan on 7

                    <p>4. The current Department of Defense plan for the reorganization and training
                        of the Congolese National Army, which has been approved by the President,
                        does not provide for an <gloss target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss> program but
                        recommends that the United Nations attempt its implementation, with the U.S.
                        willing to assume responsibility for an unspecified portion of the overall
                        plan. We do not believe this plan could be revised and implemented on a
                        timely basis to include provision for the program recommended in attached
                        memorandum, nor do we believe that such a revision would be readily accepted
                        by the U.N. For these reasons, it is proposed that C.I.A. be the executive
                        agency.</p>
                    <p>5. Implementation of attached proposal depends upon its acceptance by
                        Congolese Commander-in-Chief, General Joseph D. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, who will be visiting the U.S. as a guest of the U.S.
                        Army Chief-of-Staff between 3–15 December. If attached proposal is approved,
                        it would be presented to General <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> during his visit to Headquarters.<note n="6" xml:id="d125fn6">A November 27 memorandum from Assistant Secretary

                    <p>In telegram 5271 to the Central Intelligence Agency, November 26, 1962, the
                        Station in Leopoldville reported that the opposition had submitted a no
                        confidence motion to Chamber President Mwamba. He had so far refused
                        officially to accept it, but as this position was illegal, both the [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] and the opposition
                        believed he would be forced to accept it by November 27 at the latest.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Joseph Mobutu</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Victor Nendaka</persName>, and Minister of the
                        Interior <persName corresp="#p_KCL_1">Kamitatu</persName> were highly
                        pessimistic about the outcome of the crisis. <persName corresp="#p_KCL_1">Kamitatu</persName> estimated that the opposition <pb n="179" facs="0212" xml:id="pg_179"/> should be able to obtain the votes needed
                        to bring the government down. Katanga was widely believed to be the key
                        issue.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> took a slightly
                        more optimistic view in a meeting with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GEA_1">Gullion</persName> and the Chief of Station, the
                        telegram reported, but the Prime Minister expressed strong resentment over
                        U.S. failure to provide sufficient aid earlier to resolve the Katanga
                        crisis. <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> indicated that last
                        minute help might not do the trick but nevertheless gave the impression of a
                        man intending to fight. He believed that President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> would agree to prorogue
                        parliament for 30 days providing he was convinced strong action would be
                        taken during the interim to resolve the Katanga problem. Tangible evidence
                        of U.S. intentions was needed, <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> stated. With Congolese National Army troops in North
                        Katanga under constant attack by Government of Katanga aircraft, the
                        Government of the Congo had an urgent need for aircraft to redress the
                        balance of power. In concluding telegram 5271, the Station emphasized that
                            <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> was facing his most
                        serious crisis to date, and there were “only days or perhaps hours in which
                        to redress situation.” It was doubted that the [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym
                            not declassified</hi>] could pull the fat out of the fire without
                        receiving hardware immediately, including aircraft and other tactical
                        weapons. In any case, the Station planned to aid <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>. (Central Intelligence Agency
                        Files, Job 78–00435R, DDO/ISS Files, Box 1, Folder 12, [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] Operations)</p>
                    <p>Two days later, in telegram 5297, November 28, the Station reported that the
                            <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> government had escaped
                        defeat but that its narrow escape—and the 47 votes in favor of the
                        government—had not come easily. The Station had concentrated on the one
                        objective of preventing the government’s fall ever since the crisis had come
                        into the open on November 23; it doubted it could continue to hold the
                        present line unless dramatic steps were taken immediately. (Ibid.)</p>
                    <p>In telegram 5346 to <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, December 5,
                        Leopoldville reported that although the government had squeaked through on
                        November 28, the [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] and
                        other government supporters remained greatly concerned by the possibility
                        that the opposition, which now felt it had the government on the run, would
                        continue to try to bring it down. The [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not
                            declassified</hi>] appeared to be in a state of confusion regarding
                        which steps to take. <persName corresp="#p_NAL_1">Ndele</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Nendaka</persName> had contacted the Chief
                        of Station to ask whether they could count on U.S. support should the
                        government fall and they tried to maintain <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> in power by means of a military coup. The Chief of
                        Station replied he could not promise the necessary U.S. aid for a coup,
                        since the U.S. position would depend on many things, including alternative
                        leaders should the government fall, the Bloc position, and the policies
                        followed by the government installed by a coup. (Ibid.)</p>

                            capability was extremely important if a moderate government and
                            pro-Western chief of staff were to remain in power in Leopoldville.

                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Situation</hi></p>
                    <p>A. In early November 1962 the Katanga Air Force began bombing Congolese
                        National Army troops in North Katanga. The United Nations has been either
                        unwilling or unable to furnish air protection.</p>
                    <p>B. General <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has requested that
                        his five Harvard trainer aircraft now being flown by [<hi rend="italic">less
                            than 1 line not declassified</hi>] pilots supplied by <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, be augmented by more pilots and ground
                        crews, plus spare parts and armament for planes.</p>
                    <p>C. Unconfirmed reports indicate that Yugoslavia has offered jet aircraft with
                        pilots to the <gloss target="#t_CAF_1">CAF</gloss>, and that the Soviets are
                        preparing an offer of other military equipment.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Aims</hi></p>
                    <p>A. Provide the <gloss target="#t_CAF_1">CAF</gloss> with the capability to
                        undertake combat missions anywhere in the Congo using on-hand aircraft.</p>
                    <p>B. Restore morale of Congolese Army troops in North Katanga.</p>
                    <p>C. Prevent the <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> Government from
                        turning from the US/<gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> to undesirable
                        sources for military assistance.</p>

                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Coordination</hi></p>
                    <p>A. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GEA_1">Gullion</persName> concurred in
                        the original recommendation. On 27 November 1962 the Department of State
                        requested <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> to “prepare a memorandum
                        which will provide a basis for the Special Group to address itself to the
                        policy and financial consideration inherent in the suggested activity.” Mr.
                        Joseph Scott concurs in the submission of this memorandum.</p>
                    <p>B. The Office of the Secretary of Defense has been consulted. The feasibility
                        of <gloss target="#t_USAF_1">USAF</gloss> logistical support has not been
                        determined.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Cost</hi>—The total cost of this undertaking for the

                        special plea for approval of the proposal but recommends means of
                        implementing it should the <gloss target="#t_SG_1">SG</gloss> approve.)</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>Mr. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] observed that one of the
                        possibilities in the fast moving Congo situation is that the so-called
                            <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> Group (including
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, Ndaka and <persName corresp="#p_NAL_1">Ndele</persName>), would stage a coup i.e. prorogue
                        Parliament and carry on without it. If this should happen the leaders would
                        probably come knocking on the Station chief’s door for U.S. covert support.
                        The policy question therefore arises whether assistance should be provided
                        to them under the authorization of the program, approved by the Special
                        Group, for political support of the <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> Government.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>, who had just come from a
                        meeting in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGC_1">McGhee</persName>’s office said
                        that, at this point, he could not express an opinion. The <persName corresp="#p_MGC_1">McGhee</persName> meeting had considered possible
                        courses of action in the Congo, including the pros and cons of the
                        desirability of a coup by the <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>
                        group. There was a question in his mind as a result of the discussion at the
                        meeting, as to how much further the Department would <pb n="183" facs="0216" xml:id="pg_183"/>be willing to go in assisting the Central Congolese
                        Government without some evidence that it would be more forthcoming in trying
                        to solve the Katanga problem. After some discussion of the critical
                        situation in the Congo, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_THJ_1">Tasca</persName>
                        suggested that we consult Governor <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName>. The meeting then continued in Governor <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName>’ office where it was joined by
                        Mr. Wallner.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> summarized the situation
                        in the Congo as follows: Because of the personal dangers which the fall of
                        the <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> Government would pose for
                        them, such leaders of the <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>
                        group as <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, Ndaka and <persName corresp="#p_NAL_1">Ndele</persName> were considering a coup. Undoubtedly
                        they would seek to find out what help they could expect from the U.S. We
                        must therefore face up to this question. In the event the <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> Government falls the alternatives
                        before us in broad terms are to support the <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> group or face up to the fact that any other group
                        which would come to power would take an even harder position regarding
                        Katangan reintegration and probably would turn to the Soviet bloc for help.
                        It was not realistic to expect that any successor government could take a
                        more conciliatory line on Katanga. If the <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> group stages a coup we must expect that they will
                        press for solution of the Katanga problem. In all probability they would
                        seek an air force and continuing pressure for action on Katanga. It would be
                        shortsighted to expect less than continuing and very substantial demands.
                        While this is a disagreeable prospect the alternative is even worse; entry
                        of the Soviet bloc into the Congo in a big way.</p>
                    <p>There followed an extensive discussion of the probable consequences of our
                        looking favorably upon a coup, Governor <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName> posing a series of questions designed to explore
                        various aspects. The Agency representatives and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> tended to advocate continued
                        assistance to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, Ndaka et al.
                        emphasizing the need to give the Congolese Government an air capability and
                        pursuing the Thant plan.</p>

                        power. This resulted from fact that he consciously sought and obtained
                        middle ground position and thus was in position act as broker between Leop
                        and Stey factions. Such person essential so long as parliamentary govt
                        maintained. However, [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>]
                        abilities as compromiser proving weakness now that time for strong action
                        has arrived. This will be particularly true if parliament closed per plan.
                        At that time a strong and decisive leadership will be necessary and [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] does not seem be
                        constitutionally capable adopting such role.</p>
                    <p>2. [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] team appears realize
                        above facts. However at 28 Dec meeting team decided continue backing [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>]. This based on personal
                        friendship and loyalty toward him but primary factor seems to be their fear
                        that dropping [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] at this
                        time could lead to situation similar to that which developed when [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] and [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] clashed in Sep 60 and world debated

                            [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] work together
                        repetition this danger can be avoided. Thus, team does not want take any
                        action against [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] until
                        parliament closed. At that time they hope <persName corresp="#p_AJE_1">Anany</persName> [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not

                            January 1 announcement that parliament was being closed. It appeared
                            that they might have lucked through, despite the [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] failure to take the precautionary
                            steps recommended by the Station. (Central Intelligence Agency Files,
                            Job 78–00435R, DDO/ISS Files, Box 2, Folder 1, [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] Operations)</note> It had been
                        largely a matter of intelligence acquisition. He did, however, wish to raise
                        the question of what should be done about the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                            line not declassified</hi>] pilots who were now limited to flying in the
                        immediate vicinity of Leopoldville. As he saw it there were two valid
                        alternatives—either pull them out or augment their capability, generally as
                        outlined in the proposal that had gone to the Special Group. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TBR_1">Tweedy</persName> said that he was not at this time
                        making any recommendation—merely <pb n="189" facs="0222" xml:id="pg_189"/>
                        raising the question. Mr. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]
                        observed that he had discussed the matter with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>, Director of <gloss target="#t_AFC_1">AFC</gloss>, who was in favor of expanding the
                        Congolese Government’s air capability. The Congolese Government could well
                        use such an instrument to maintain order.<note n="3" xml:id="d133fn3">Katanga’s secession ended on January 21, 1963.</note> The tribal

                        which would take months, the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] pilots would be very useful. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fredericks</persName> indicated he also favored
                        providing the Congolese Government with an air force capability. Mr.
                        Wellborn reviewed the status of the proposal—it had been approved by the
                        Special Group but held in abeyance because of the rapid developments in the
                        Congo right after that and the emergence of other considerations.</p>
                    <p>As Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TBR_1">Tweedy</persName> was going to get the
                        views of the Embassy and the Station on what to do about the pilots, Mr.
                        Wellborn suggested the field’s views and the Agency’s recommendations be
                        submitted to the Department by [<hi rend="italic">less than one line not
                            declassified</hi>] memorandum. This could form the basis of a memorandum
                        to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>, from <gloss target="#t_INR_1">INR</gloss> incorporating <gloss target="#t_AF_1">AF</gloss>’s recommendation.<note n="5" xml:id="d133fn5">At a meeting

                                <persName corresp="#p_TBR_1">Tweedy</persName> noted that the
                            Cleveland Report considered valid the Congolese Air Force’s need for a
                            tactical air capability represented by six Harvard aircraft and that to
                            maintain this capability the services of non-Congolese pilots were
                            needed for at least a year, until Congolese pilots could be trained.
                            However, it was quite another matter to work out practical arrangements,
                                <persName corresp="#p_TBR_1">Tweedy</persName> remarked. The [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] were now there essentially
                            on a crash, short term basis. If their services were to be extended for
                            a year, or probably longer as it was difficult to foresee that Congolese
                            pilots could be trained in that time, the arrangements would have to be
                            on an entirely different basis. (Memorandum from Alfred Wellborn to

                            [<persName corresp="#p_GEA_1">Gullion</persName>] and passed to
                            [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] in late January
                        1963. As Headquarters is aware, the Station has been pushing the [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] to establish a strong
                        party mechanism for well over a year. While [Embassy] has always accepted
                        the need for such an organization, some of its members previously looked
                        upon such a development with mixed feelings, for some [Embassy] officers
                        objected to the patronage and other “questionable” aspects involved in
                        creating a strong political mechanism. However, [Embassy] views have evolved
                        with the local political situation and all [Embassy] officers are now strong
                        proponents of the plan. The [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not
                            declassified</hi>] are the main problem. As a result of the shortage of
                        qualified leaders, they do not have anyone available to work fulltime on
                        this problem, and, although the [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not
                            declassified</hi>] favor the creation of a new national party, the
                        project has not got off the ground. Also, the Station has not insisted upon
                        an immediate beginning, for Leopoldville is reluctant to expend the large
                        sums that would be involved in such an operation unless it has one qualified
                        asset to monitor expenditures and provide guidance on a day-to-day basis. In
                        the absence of such direction and supervision, it is doubtful that the
                        operation would succeed and it is probable that considerable funds would be
                        wasted.</p>

                        regards those matters on which the Station had had contact with him. He
                        appeared tired, disinterested, and lacking in the fighting spirit he had
                        shown in the past. This led to a discussion of his possible replacement. Mr.

                        number of political figures were mentioned as having certain assets but
                        these were counterbalanced by serious shortcomings so that no one loomed as

                    <p>In telegram 6298 from Leopoldville to the Central Intelligence Agency, March
                        14, 1963, the Chief of Station reported that the Congo Government was in
                        serious political trouble caused by lack of political organization and
                        know-how, [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>], and a multitude of
                        nearly insoluble problems which had plagued the Congo since independence.
                        When he warned [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] that the U.S
                        Government did not want to pour money into a lost cause, [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] said it would probably take at least a year
                        for the [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] to create a political
                        organization of the type required to eliminate or reduce constant
                        vote-buying. The Chief of Station noted that the United States had a choice
                        between terminating support for the moderates, which would probably result
                        in their fall, or continuing to provide support over the coming year, [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]. He pointed out that, although

                        had maintained a government which was as pro-American as any that could be

                    <p>The central objective of this project continues to be the strengthening of

                        pro-West, or at least genuinely neutral, government remains in power. The

                    <p>Approximately 200 field intelligence reports were received during 1962, a
                        very large percentage of which were disseminated. Much of the information
                        was semi-overt or highly perishable. Undoubtedly some of this information
                        was slanted since the [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>]
                        clearly knew they were talking to U.S. officials and it is doubtful that
                        they always made a clear distinction between Department of State and <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> officers. Nevertheless, on many occasions
                        valuable information was received in time for the U.S. Government to
                        consider it and act upon it before the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                        itself took certain steps. In addition, it is highly probable that because
                        of the special relationship with the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not

                        information was obtained which could not have been obtained by Embassy

                        has played a significant role in maintaining both the existence and the

                        secession and the ability of the <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> Government to focus its attention effectively upon
                        internal problems, particularly economic ones. Reasonable achievements in
                        this area should do much to ensure continued political support by the
                        population. Nevertheless, the future stability of the <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> Government is by no means ensured
                        even with the successful reintegration of Katanga. A slight de-emphasis on
                        public relations in the international arena is possible. The formation of a
                        political organization able to concentrate close local and provincial
                        political support for the <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>
                        Government is necessary. Increased internal propaganda support is
                        envisioned, and candidates for newspaper and radio jobs are currently being
                        interviewed and assessed.</p>

                    <p>7. In summation political situation remains even more confused than usual.
                        Opposition apparently has votes to bring down govt, but as opposition lacks
                        cohesion [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] belief that he
                        can split opposition may yet prove correct. Leop remains pessimistic insofar

                        through but anything possible when dealing with power-hungry individuals who
                        put personal objectives ahead of national good. Should govt fall believe

                        plans. Primary problem is that each opposition leader sets forth his views
                        as opposition policy when in reality these leaders are generally speaking
                        only for themselves or at most their small group. (However Leop continuing

                        but even then their statements cannot be accepted en toto. They too are
                        confused and desperately seeking and considering various alternative
                        solutions. As new developments arise their position shifts. In short, Leop

                            organization not be centered on <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> personally but be based on the inner [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] circle, which should

                            complexion. It suggested that the organization be built at two
                            levels—one (overt) based on the essential tribal structure of the Congo
                            and the second [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] to be a

                    <p>Telegram 6570 from the Station in Leopoldville to the Central Intelligence
                        Agency, April 10, 1963, reported that the political situation there was so
                        murky that it was difficult to determine whether Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Cyrille Adoula</persName> would survive. On April 9,
                        the Chief of Station met with the Prime Minister and told him that he
                        thought that the great mass of the Congolese population was disgusted with
                        the lack of government action and the ostentatious living and corruption of
                        its political leaders. He urged <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> to take decisive action to terminate the <pb n="198" facs="0231" xml:id="pg_198"/>incompetent parliament immediately,
                        suggesting that he select a small government of the most qualified
                        individuals and announce a program with limited objectives such as severe
                        austerity, an anti-corruption campaign, and immediate implementation of a
                        public works program. (Central Intelligence Agency Files, Job 78–00435R,

                    <p>The Agency responded in telegram 31679, April 10, that the disturbing aspect
                        of telegram 6570 was that even though Leopoldville agreed that <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> had shown himself thoroughly
                        incapable of taking any action—decisive or otherwise—during the crisis,
                        Leopoldville still believed that urging him to take such action would have
                        the desired results. Experience regretfully just did not permit such a
                        hopeful conclusion to be drawn. (Ibid.)</p>
                    <p>In telegram 6687 to Headquarters, April 20, Leopoldville reported that the
                            [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] were again in trouble and
                        facing a no confidence vote. On the urging of the Ambassador, funds had been
                        passed [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] for use in this vote.
                        The Station requested authorization to expend additional funds to keep the
                            [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] afloat. (Ibid.) The
                        Agency responded in telegram 34111, April 20, that its impression was that
                            <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>’s inept handling of
                        cabinet reorganization, his failure to take other [<hi rend="italic">text
                            not declassified</hi>] into his confidence, and the fact that he could
                        rely on only 48 chamber votes appeared to make it unlikely he could survive
                        until the end of June. Hence Headquarters, while authorizing additional
                        funds, was reluctant to pour in money with scant hope of success. Due to the
                        past failures of either <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> or the
                        Department of State to influence <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>’s tactics, the Agency was pessimistic that any new
                        radical approach could change the situation and get <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> out of his self made box.
                        (Ibid.)</p>
                    <p>Telegram 6708 from Leopoldville to <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>,
                        April 23, expressed the hope that <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> would close parliament before the end of April, and
                        said that in view of his success in the April 20 no confidence vote, he
                        might make it through. The Station was keeping its fingers crossed.

                        project is all right as the Clandestine Services have funds for the project
                        in both <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1963 and <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1964.</p>
                    <p>2. From the policy point of view, there appears to be ample support for the

                        U.S. Government. There appears to be some doubt, however, as to whether
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> must render this support or whether
                        it could come from other sources (the U.S. Air Force or <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>). The DD/P believes that practical
                        considerations make it extremely unlikely that another Government Agency

                    <p>Despite the frustrations and difficulties of operating in the Congo, our
                        actions there over the last 18 months have helped materially to reduce the
                        Katanga secession and to maintain in power a moderate, pro-Western
                        government. If the Congo is to consolidate the gains already made and move
                        into a nation-building phase, it is essential that these actions be carried
                        forward, as outlined below.</p>

                    <p>On May 23, 1963, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Joseph Mobutu</persName>
                        visited Central Intelligence Agency Headquarters for discussion and a
                        luncheon. That same day, in telegram 7032 to <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, the Chief of Station in Leopoldville spoke favorably of
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> while offering his last
                        views before leaving the Congo. He said that he continued to regard
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> as their best insurance
                        that the [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] effort would not
                        fail, and thought he was the most sincere U.S. friend in the Congo. Although
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> had many weaknesses, the
                        Chief of Station believed the United States should continue to bet on him,
                        as there was no alternative with similar power. (Central Intelligence Agency

                    <p>1. This dispatch is meant not so much to enlighten the field as to the
                        political realities of the Congo as to clarify our own thinking and commit
                        some specific thoughts to paper. We hope that you will read it thoughtfully,
                        discuss it with appropriate [Embassy] personnel, and comment upon it both
                        substantively and in context of the operational problems it raises. Because
                        of its sensitivity, we are not sending copies to either of the Bases, but
                        hope you will discuss it with Base personnel at first opportunity.</p>
                    <p>2. With each succeeding political crisis, the <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> Government has had increasing difficulty in
                        maintaining itself, even with substantial outside help. One result has been
                        that <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>, to maintain his
                        personal position, has been forced to make compromises with various
                        opposition members at the cost of his partially alienating and breaking the
                        cohesion of the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>].
                        On some occasions he has consulted the Group and rejected their advice, on
                        others he has not consulted them. Further, <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> has shown no particular aptitude for using
                        compromises to strengthen his position. He talks with the full spectrum of
                        political leaders, excluding the extreme nationalists, and makes or implies
                        numerous and contradictory commitments, many of which he cannot fulfill. The
                        result is that he displeases as many as he pleases and his net gains, if
                        any, are not significant.</p>
                    <p>4. In our talks with the [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>],
                        as well as by policy authorization, we are committed to support the [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] effort(s) to organize a
                        national political party and must therefore make at least a gesture to
                        follow through, not only because of our commitments but also as a matter of
                        prudence in hedging bets. <pb n="204" facs="0237" xml:id="pg_204"/>However,
                        the various forces in process of coalescence in the post-secessionist era
                        give strong indications that an <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> Government will probably be challenged with
                        increasing success as time goes on; it behooves <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss> to extend its range of contacts and to extend political
                        action aid to most individuals and groups whose capability, actual or
                        potential, to challenge <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>
                        successfully make them potential future allies. Our objective is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to perpetuate the <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> regime indefinitely, but to insure in the Congo a
                        moderate, friendly government capable of getting the Congo moving along the
                        road back. The ultimate purpose is to deny the Congo to the Bloc.</p>
                    <p>5. In considering the political forces in being or in formation in the Congo,
                        we should identify and give consideration to non-political organizations
                        which can exercise a palpable to decisive influence in politics. These
                        include: the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>, the Sûreté, the labor
                        unions. They also include foreign governments, <gloss target="#t_UMHK_1">UMHK</gloss> and other large, primarily Belgian, industrial and
                        commercial interests, plus the <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> and
                        the many individuals therein who are willing and able to intervene in
                        Congolese politics.</p>
                    <p>6. Among the parties whose actual and potential position should be reviewed
                        are: the Abako, representing the Bakongo tribe exclusively; the Conakat,
                        which traditionally represents the most powerful tribes of Katanga except
                        for the Balubas; the Balubakat, representing the Baluba tribes of Katanga;
                        the Baluba-Kasai; the <gloss target="#t_MNC_1">MNC</gloss>/L, whose strength
                        is largely regional at this point (Orientale and parts of Kivu) and which is
                        substantially the only identifiable organization left of the original <gloss target="#t_MNC_1">MNC</gloss>; and the <gloss target="#t_PSA_1">PSA</gloss>. Other parties either represent smaller tribal groups, are
                        largely the feeble instruments of individuals, or are small but potentially
                        powerful extremists; these include the Puna, Unimo, Reko, Cerka and
                        Kapwasa’s nascent party in Katanga.</p>
                    <p>6. The Traditional Chiefs Organization (TCO) in the Senate is of particular
                        interest. It is the only known political organization which cuts across
                        political lines, and the only one which forms a nucleus for political
                        discussion and decision by important tribal leaders as such. It is assumed
                        that tribalism will be an important if not decisive factor in Congo politics
                        for the foreseeable future.</p>
                    <p>7. In our thinking, the important facts are whether individuals or groups are
                        pro-West, pro-Bloc or “neutralist”; whether “moderate” or “radical.” In many
                        cases, it is easy to identify individuals or groups within these categories.
                        But in Congolese politics, individuals and groups do not nucleate within
                        these categories, i.e., the pro-Bloc groups do not necessarily band together
                        because they are pro-Bloc. Issues are usually quite local, frequently
                        evanescent and very often highly personal; leftists and moderates will band
                        together to undercut an individual too long in office, or to defeat a
                        measure which threatens their <pb n="205" facs="0238" xml:id="pg_205"/>official perquisites. Issues are rarely ideological or philosophical,
                        although they may sometimes assume such as protective coloration. This
                        factor makes our choice(s) difficult from an organizational standpoint. We
                        can select a series of groups who, by our logic, should combine themselves
                        into a potent organization; yet such an organization will inexplicably (to
                        us) shatter itself over an inconsequential issue.</p>
                    <p>8. The Abako Party for the foreseeable future, will continue to be moderate
                        and pro-West and federalist. It has no potential to become a national party.
                        It is the natural ally of other moderate, tribally-based parties which also
                        favor the continuation of tribal autonomy through fairly to very loose
                        federation within the Congo. Its hold over the significant Bakongo tribal
                        area is unlikely to be challenged. The major bar to its enduring alliance
                        with other tribal parties is the question of spoils of office and
                        regional/national sharing of revenues. Its leaders hold and will continue to
                        hold an important share in the Central Government cabinet and other
                        appointive offices. A major issue is the question of the jurisdiction over
                        Leopoldville city, traditionally Bakongo territory, and with great voting
                        power (population approaching 1,000,000). A secondary issue is Central
                        Government support of the Union of Angolan Peoples (UPA), which support is
                        contrary to the Abako’s unrealistic ambition to control the Bakongo tribes
                        of Angola and both Congos and in come mystical fashion to resurrect the old
                        Kongo Empire. The <gloss target="#t_ABAKO_1">ABAKO</gloss> probably
                        maintains greater unity between provincial and national leaders than do
                        other parties, primarily because of the location of Leopoldville. However,
                        it can hardly be described as a monolith.</p>
                    <p>9. The Conakat Party, consisting of the non-Baluba forces of Katanga (plus
                        Kasongo-Niembo’ Balubas), is dominated by Lunda and Bayeke leaders. Its
                        virtual exclusion of Balubas is based on the traditional hostility toward
                        the Baluba fostered by Baluba superiority in adapting to Katanga’s
                        industrial society. The Conakat has been supported heavily by <gloss target="#t_UMHK_1">UMHK</gloss> and conservative Belgian industrial and
                        intellectual circles, and its views generally favor the continuation of a
                        Belgian presence and of free enterprise; politically, it favors maximum
                        decentralization of central government and a minimal sharing of provincial
                        revenues. The degree to which it still enjoys Belgian support is still
                        undertermined; it is likely to return to secessionism if the final Congolese
                        constitution does not permit a large degree of provincial autonomy or if
                            <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> units in Katanga continue to act in
                        an undisciplined fashion.</p>
                    <p>10. The Balubakat party is traditionally opposed to the Conakat for tribal
                        reasons, and has in the past been its competitor for power in Katanga. Since
                        the end of Katanga’s secession, a large element of the Balubakat has favored
                        a rapprochement with the Conakat and the formation of a United Front in
                        central government parliament, and the <pb n="206" facs="0239" xml:id="pg_206"/>reunification of North and South Katanga. Some elements
                        of the Balubakat, particularly those members now holding official positions
                        in the North Katanga Government, oppose such reunification.</p>
                    <p>11. There are strong reasons why the United Front should hold together;
                        thereby, they could represent in the central government the largest and
                        richest province, and, with the resources at their disposal, could exercise
                        a decisive influence in national politics. Further, such a United Front
                        would have a natural affinity with the Abako party which has substantially
                        the same political aims, particularly regarding provincial autonomy. The
                        aims of the Baluba/Kasai group should also be substantially similar. So
                        there is the possibility of an alliance of the major parties of the entire
                        southern half of the Congo as a conservative, Western-oriented, coalition
                        representing the majority of the Congolese population, a majority which
                        embodies the highest percentage of skills, and an overwhelming percentage of
                        its wealth. While such a coalition would probably pursue acceptable
                        policies, it would also risk bringing about a sharp North-South cleavage.
                        The extremists of the <gloss target="#t_PSA_1">PSA</gloss>, MNC/L and Cerea
                        would oppose it by all means, probably including violence. The Mongo/Bangala
                        groups would oppose it as they would be relinquishing the important
                        positions they now occupy, and as—coming from a poor province—they would
                        favor more rather than less central government control of the provinces and
                        their revenues. Similarly, the moderates of Orientale and Kivu would oppose
                        such a coalition as it would seriously reduce their voices in the
                        parliament. Nevertheless, that serious opposition to a
                        Conakat/Balubakat/Baluba–Kasai/Abako coalition would arise should not be
                        over-stressed; there will be serious opposition to any force which threatens
                        to become predominant in Congo politics, and means can always be found to
                        ameliorate the sharpness of such opposition. It appears to us that the
                        emergence of such a coalition is the most probable political development,
                        given the “geopolitical” forces in play.</p>
                    <p>12. As for the other political groups in the Congo today, it is evident that
                        that formerly strong MNC/L, as well as the <gloss target="#t_PSA_1">PSA</gloss>, are deeply, perhaps irretrievably split between their
                        moderate and extremist wings; further, that there seems to be less and less
                        identity between party stalwarts at the provincial and national levels.
                        Cerea, if it still exists in fact, is similarly split
                        (Kashamura/Weregemere), and the remaining parties in parliament can hardly
                        be said to exist as such. There is the possibility, of course, that these
                        disparate elements could bury their differences for the immediate, tactical
                        purpose of surviving in the face of a coalescence of the southern tier
                        forces described above. Given the history of efforts elsewhere to form
                        “united fronts” between right and left (or moderate and extremist), and
                        given the ever-presence of Soviet assistance to the extremists, we believe
                        that a “united front” of the <pb n="207" facs="0240" xml:id="pg_207"/>northern tier should be discouraged, and attempts be made to prevent its
                        formation or, if formed, to fragment it, on the grounds that it is likely to
                        fall under radical influence.</p>
                    <p>13. Assuming that the above analysis has at least a shred of validity, there
                        are several courses of action available:</p>
                    <p>A. Continued support of the present ruling group. We are committed to do this
                        and have been given specific authority therefor, so some effort will have to
                        be made in this direction. The group, however, has the shortcomings cited in
                        Dir 36265, and it is doubtful if they could withstand the forces of a
                        southern tier coalition.</p>
                    <p>B. Observe the trend toward the formation of a southern tier coalition with
                        the possibility of supporting it (and fragmenting the opposition) at some
                        future point in time.</p>
                    <p>C. <gloss target="#t_Re_1">Re</gloss>-explore the tribal chiefs approach.
                        Despite the Traditional Chiefs Organization’s very poor showing to date, one
                        cannot help but feel that the Congo is going to be tribally-based for some
                        time to come, and that a viable political organization must take this into
                        account and channel it into productive channels.</p>
                    <p>D. Engage in tactical political action on an ad hoc basis, while reinforcing
                        the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>’s reliability and capabilities
                        through troop indoctrination programs with the aim of placing the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> in a totally decisive position in internal
                        affairs, at least to the extent that if our interest requires their
                        intervention in political affairs, we may be assured that such intervention
                        will be effective.</p>
                    <p>E. Approach Congolese political organizational problems on a clandestine
                        basis ([<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>]), attempting to
                        build “cells” or “control groups” in the major political entities.</p>
                    <p>14. Evidently, it is theoretically possible to combine more than one of the
                        above alternatives into a combined approach to the problem. And, it need
                        hardly be said, we must exercise a reasonable economy of effort, consistent
                        with our basic objective to deny the Congo to the Bloc.</p>
                    <p>15. Lastly, we have addressed ourselves alone largely to the political
                        situation of the immediate post-independence period during which the first
                        generation of politicians continue to dominate—leaders largely elected in
                        1960. We must be diligent in identifying and developing appropriate
                        relations with the men of the second generation as they emerge.</p>

                        claim that parties which are expected to merge with the <gloss target="#t_MPC_1">MPC</gloss> are the PDC (<persName corresp="#p_AJE_1">Anany</persName>) (also Kanany): the Parti de Reconstruction Nationale
                        (Manzikala): Cerea (<persName corresp="#p_MJE_1">Miruho</persName> and
                        Rudahindwa). Encouraging conversations have reportedly been held with
                        Interior Minister Maboti and Emile Zola. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 3</persName>] states that <persName corresp="#p_BJE_1">Bolikango</persName> represents a force in Lisala which cannot be
                        ignored. Nyembo and Yav are said to be in favor of the[<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] idea. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] reportedly intends the <gloss target="#t_MPC_1">MPC</gloss> to have a revolutionary platform designed
                        to preempt the nationalist area now claimed by the MNC/L.</p>
                    <p>6. To date we have not discussed with [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            1</persName>] the plans ascribed to him, and we would as a first and
                        precautionary step, do so promptly upon receipt of a favorable response from
                            <gloss target="#t_HQS_1">HQS</gloss> to this cable. To date we can only
                        report that [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] recently
                        demonstrated an active and interested awareness of our plan to bring a
                        political party adviser to Leopoldville on 17 June.</p>
                    <p>7. If <gloss target="#t_HQS_1">HQS</gloss> agrees, we would stress the
                        following points in our talks with [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            1</persName>] on this subject:</p>
                    <p>A. The importance of establishing party units at the local level in all
                        districts of the Congo, and in all significant institutions in the urban
                        areas, such as the trade unions, student organizations, chambers of
                        commerce, together with a special propaganda campaign directed at the army.
                        A dialogue should also be established with the church organizations.</p>
                    <p>B. An effective press and publicity section should be organized at once.</p>
                    <p>C. A provisional National Party Committee should be appointed by [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>], including the designation of
                        a treasurer through whom all receipts and disbursements must pass.</p>
                    <p>C. A forceful political and economic program should be drawn up, including
                        plans for a public works program and a program for constitutional reform
                        permitting the establishment of a strong executive with an assured term of
                        four years.</p>
                    <p>D. A fund-raising campaign should be initiated, canvassing business and
                        industry, and collecting dues from party members, [<hi rend="italic">1 line
                            not declassified</hi>] and other well-wishers.</p>
                    <p>E. Set up a membership committee to keep out extremist elements who might try
                        to take over the party later on.</p>
                    <p>F. Plan for the participation of the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> in
                        supervision of the polling places to ensure honest outcome.</p>
                    <p>G. Study ways of limiting the number of parties which may compete in the
                        national elections (but not set up a one-party system), <pb n="210" facs="0243" xml:id="pg_210"/>perhaps by requiring a certain number of
                        signatures from each province.</p>
                    <p>H. An independent auditor should be appointed to control mismanagement of
                        funds.</p>
                    <p>8. Station would appreciate early reaction to above proposal, since local
                        politicoes already beginning to look ahead actively toward elections, and
                        are beginning to press for financial aid; e.g. <persName corresp="#p_MJE_1">Miruho</persName>, Anekonzapa, [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            3</persName>] and [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>]
                        and we would like to exercise this leverage to force such applicants to turn
                        to the <gloss target="#t_MPC_1">MPC</gloss> for their money. This policy
                        naturally would not preclude our disbursing small amounts for purely
                        informational purposes.</p>
                    <p>9. Station not proposing detailed budget at this time, but if authorized
                        would draw up breakdown by categories of activity, and also a breakdown on
                        installment plan, to retain control.</p>
                    <p>10. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 3</persName>] now pressing for
                            [<hi rend="italic">amount not declassified</hi>] to enable <persName corresp="#p_ELE_1">Engulu</persName> to visit all provincial presidents

                    </list>
                    <p>1. This is my first monthly letter since assuming charge of the Leopoldville
                        Station from [former <gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] on 1 June 1963.
                        These first two months have been characterized by a lull in the normally
                        crisis-ridden Congo political scene. In fact, people are beginning to ask
                        themselves whether Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> is not more astute than they had supposed, since,
                        despite his much talked-about indecisiveness, his lack of skill in meeting
                        the electorate, and his seeming pedestrian gait in general, he has, as he
                        slyly points out himself, remained in office, he has weathered the
                        parliamentary storms, and he has even increased his international stature on
                        the African scene, mainly by his handling of the Angolan problem.</p>
                    <p>2. Operationally, the period has been one of reassessment of goals in the
                        light of the end of the Katanga secession. Whatever the final decision may
                        turn out to be on the extent to which we are to “give the country back to
                        the Belgians”, the Station is satisfied that <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss>
                        <pb n="212" facs="0245" xml:id="pg_212"/>must as a minimum continue to give
                        strong support to the Army and to the Security Services, as the best
                        guarantee against a takeover either by the Communists or by the more
                        unreconstructed Belgian conservatives, neither of which eventuality would be

                        how President’s <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>’s closure
                        of the Congolese Parliament affected the Agency’s political action program
                        in the Congo. “Mr. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] observed
                        that the Agency had been pursuing the policy of bolstering the [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] and of endeavoring to develop
                        an effective political organization to support Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>. It had found that the Congolese

                        apparently not doing badly. For the moment the funds authorized by the

                        Congolese and that U.S. and Belgian efforts might be cancelling each other
                        to a certain extent, but a recent development was expected to provided
                        adequate safeguards against that. (Department of State Files, <gloss target="#t_INR_1">INR</gloss>/IL Historical Files, <gloss target="#t_AF_1">AF</gloss> Meetings, 1963)</p>

                    <p>In telegram 76839 to Leopoldville, October 18, 1963, the Central Intelligence
                        Agency stated that it would appreciate as soon as possible the suggestions
                        of the Chief of Station and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GEA_1">Gullion</persName> regarding the nature of future U.S. support should

                        inferior to <pb n="215" facs="0248" xml:id="pg_215"/>the one he held now.
                        The Chief of Station and the Ambassador were to include in their
                        consideration such factors as the ascendancy of Belgian political influence,
                        and also extremist nationalist activity. (Central Intelligence Agency Files,

                    <p>In telegram 8639 to <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, October 19, the
                        Chief of Station and the Ambassador responded that they thought <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> would pull through again this time,
                        but agreed that they should not be caught without a contingency policy in
                        case he were demoted or removed completely. In case of the latter, their
                        best estimate was that <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> would
                        be replaced initially at least by a basically moderate leader whose cabinet
                        would reflect roughly the same political spectrum as was now running the
                        country. Whether <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> survived or
                        not, they recommended that the United States continue to keep a strong hand
                        in the Congolese political picture—partly as a brake on the more baneful
                        aspects of Belgian commercial policy, and partly because creation of a
                        national moderate political party (which the United States was covertly
                        supporting) would make a valuable contribution to future political stability
                        in the Congo. (Ibid.)</p>

                    <p>1. Pursuant to policy guidance from the Special Group, the [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] program has been operative since
                        November </p>
                    <pb n="217" facs="0250" xml:id="pg_217"/>
                    <p>1961. There was an initial Special Group authorization for [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>]. A progress and status report made
                        in April 1963 requested authority to continue certain covert actions at a
                        cost of [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] for <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1964. This authority was approved by the
                        Special Group.</p>
                    <p>2. The [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] program has been,
                        in effect, the covert action program to maintain and support the <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> government in the Congo in
                        implementation of U.S. policy directives. The judicious use of covertly
                        provided funds has kept opposition groups off-balance and uncoordinated to
                        the extent that the incumbent moderate government has survived. This
                        government is now able to focus for the first time on the establishment of a
                        national political party initially to provide an organizational base for the
                        projected national elections next spring. The Station has been urging the
                        incumbent government for sometime to systematize their political
                        activities.</p>
                    <p>3. The matter at issue is the extent of covert support to the formation of
                        this national political party. The Leopoldville Station has submitted a
                        budget of [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] for this
                        purpose. This request exceeds the current <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss>
                        1964 (within ceiling) operational program funds ear-marked for [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] activities by [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>]. In anticipation of
                        exceptional demands, [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>]
                        was requested over ceiling for [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not

                        Division alerting him to the possibility of such a request for additional

                    <p>4. The request for a budget of [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                            declassified</hi>] was arrived at after exhaustive discussions with
                        responsible members of the <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>

                    <p>1. As noted in [Embassy] traffic cited refs, [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] has emerged from the events of last two weeks,
                        despite his well known shortcomings, as the one figure who by his relative
                        moderation and patience is able to set a limit to impulses of his colleagues
                        in direction ruthless authoritarian regime. Believe [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>], despite their real fear of

                        matériel would have to be deferred. If the plan is to be initiated in the
                        Congo by 1 May 1964, the political decision should be made by 1 March 1964.
                        CINCSTRIKE/USCINCMEAFSA will recommend to the Office of the Director of
                        Military Assistance, <gloss target="#t_OASD_1">OASD</gloss>(ISA), priorities
                        for the deferral of matériel, if this plan is approved for
                        implementation.</p>
                    <p>3. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that, given a political requirement to
                        preserve a pro-Western regime in the Congo (Leopoldville), the retraining of
                        the Congolese National Army (<gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>) into a
                        disciplined force responsive to legitimate authority and loyal to the
                        established government continues to be an urgent military task. However, the
                        retraining effort is only one approach to the problem of instability in the
                        Congo (Leopoldville) and is related to US attempts to achieve objectives in
                        the economic and political spheres. Training, by itself, will not insure
                        that the pro-Western Congolese will remain in power. The <pb n="221" facs="0254" xml:id="pg_221"/>military effort can only be an instrument
                        to aid in the achievement of economic and political goals. This training
                        effort should in no way imply that the United States will commit its forces
                        to military or paramilitary operations in the maintenance of internal
                        security in the country. Further, the Joint Chiefs of Staff view with
                        concern the possibilities that action on the part of the United States to
                        undertake to increase its role in retraining of the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> might prove counterproductive for reasons enumerated below.
                        They therefore offer the following additional views:</p>
                    <p>a. The task of retraining should be undertaken by the Belgians and Italians
                        on the basis of policy and planning to date. Diplomatic and political
                        efforts at high level should be intensified by the United States to persuade
                        the Belgians and Italians to initiate, prior to 1 March 1964, an effective
                        retraining program.</p>
                    <p>b. While the United States should avoid identification with the Israeli
                        retraining program in the Congo (Leopoldville), discreet efforts should be
                        undertaken to contribute to the effectiveness of the Israeli program, as may
                        be appropriate.</p>
                    <p>c. The <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Secretary General (<gloss target="#t_UNSYG_1">UNSYG</gloss>) should be urged to require the
                        present <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Forces in the Congo (<gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss>) to reduce lawless activities in
                        coordination with and in anticipation of the turnover of responsibility for
                        internal security to the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> and, in the
                        meantime, to contribute in any way feasible to the increased effectiveness
                        of the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>d. The United States should not itself undertake direct operational training
                        of the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> pending:</p>
                    <p>(1) Further evidence, including a determination at the appropriate political
                        level, that it is demanded by US national interests.</p>
                    <p>(2) Approval by the appropriate Congolese authorities of training programs at
                        small unit levels as recommended by the United States.</p>
                    <p>(3) Mutually acceptable coordination with the appropriate Belgian
                        authorities.</p>
                    <p>(4) Consideration of its impact on other African nations.</p>
                    <p>(5) Consideration of the possibility that direct participation by the United
                        States might contribute to further internal instability, if exploited
                        sufficiently by communist and other political elements in opposition to the
                        Congolese Government.</p>
                    <p>e. In the event political considerations require the United States to
                        undertake a portion of the operational training, the United States should
                        offer to train, in priority, a battalion plus supporting units in the
                        Leopoldville area and two battalions plus supporting units in the
                        Elisabethville (Katanga) area, utilizing small Mobile Training Teams (MTTs)
                        plus command and staff personnel to control and coordinate the entire US
                        effort. MTTs would be phased in on a schedule designed to keep the number of
                        US personnel in the country at a minimum.</p>
                    <pb n="222" facs="0255" xml:id="pg_222"/>
                    <p>f. The commitment of these training teams might prove insufficient to
                        maintain a pro-Western regime in power in the light of the history of the
                        Congo (Leopoldville) and the factors now contributing to instability.</p>
                    <p>4. The commitment of US operational forces as distinct from training forces
                        is beyond the scope of this paper and has not been considered in the
                        formulation of the attached retraining plan.</p>

                    <p>1037. Please deliver following letter from Secretary to <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName>:</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Begin verbatim text.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>My dear Mr. Minister:</p>
                    <p>I am increasingly concerned about the prospect of widespread chaos in the
                        Congo which is likely to face us a few months from now when the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Force must leave. Even as matters now stand,
                        it can hardly be said that the Central Government exercises effective
                        control much beyond the major population centers. The recent insurgency in
                        Kwilu Province,<note n="2" xml:id="d159fn2">On January 21, Congolese
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Joseph Kasavubu</persName>
                            declared a state of emergency in Kwilu Province, where rebellious
                            tribesmen had seized control of one-third of the territory.</note>
                        organized by a Congolese trained in Communist China, is I fear but a sample
                        of what we may have to confront.</p>
                    <p>I know Ambassador MacArthur has spoken to you about this matter several times
                        and I know that I do not need to rehearse the argument <pb n="223" facs="0256" xml:id="pg_223"/> that fundamental cause of instability in
                        the Congo is the lack of a trained and disciplined army. I am mindful of the
                        efforts that you have personally been making to expedite Belgian
                        participation in the retraining efforts and I am aware of many of the
                        difficulties that you have faced in getting officers to the Congo. However,
                        the prospect of a debacle in the Congo putting us back to the days of 1960
                        is terrible to contemplate.</p>
                    <p>From where I sit, trying to look at our various responsibilities for free
                        world defense in several parts of the globe, I am impressed both with the
                        potential dangers of communist breakthrough in the Congo and with the
                        special responsibility which Belgium, because of its historical affiliation
                        with the Congo, has to shore up that particular front. With your unique
                        knowledge of and vast investment in the Congo, in manpower, in industry, and
                        in relevant experience, this particular part of the free world defense
                        effort should rest primarily, I believe, with your Government. I think it
                        would not be too much to say that this is the most important security task
                        which Belgium can assume in the common interest.</p>
                    <p>We share with you a vital interest in stability in the Congo and we are
                        prepared to consider any further step you may think useful for us to take to
                        that end.</p>
                    <p>For one reason or another, in the three and one-half difficult years since
                        Congolese independence, the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> has not
                        become a force capable of supporting an effective government and dealing
                        with an internal security problem of great scope and complexity. Retraining
                        the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> for this task will require, in our
                        best judgement, a substantial increase in your training program in the
                        immediate future. In particular, we would hope to see a substantial number
                        of Belgian officers placed in forward units at least down to the battalion
                        level. I therefore hope you will find it possible to redouble your efforts
                        and intensify the good work you are already doing.<note n="3" xml:id="d159fn3">In telegram 1182 from Brussels, February 15, Ambassador

                    </list>
                    <p>There will be a serious security situation in the Congo following the
                        withdrawal of United Nations forces at the end of June 1964, given the size
                        of the country and existence of a variety of actual and potential
                        insurgencies and secessions. The current insurgency in Kwilu province, led
                        by a Congolese long associated with both the Soviets and Chinese,
                        underscores the gravity of the problem. The poorly trained and
                        ill-disciplined Congolese army (<gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>) is
                        incapable of coping with that problem and is often a source of disorder
                        itself.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> forces in the Congo are greatly
                        reduced in number but still contribute substantially to stability in the two
                        critical urban areas, Leopoldville and Elisabethville. Retention of the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> forces beyond July 1 does not appear
                        feasible since it would require a special session of the General Assembly
                        which would raise the difficult problems of Chinese representation and of
                        applying Article 19 to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Moreover,
                        the Secretary General and a substantial number of delegations would oppose a
                        continuation of <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss>. In any event, an
                        extension of <gloss target="#t_UNOC_1">UNOC</gloss> would not solve the
                        basic problems because the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> is not engaged
                        in dealing with present insurgency in Kwilu province and is not engaged in
                        training the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The training problem therefore has to be faced now. While we will continue to
                        look to Belgium to assume primary responsibility for <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> training, we have (with Belgian
                        concurrence) also encouraged other countries to participate. In addition to
                        Belgian plans for training the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>, Israel
                        and Italy have also undertaken to provide some training to paracommando
                        units and the air force. However, the training programs of these three
                        countries have barely begun. We are doing everything possible to encourage
                        them to accelerate their programs and, in particular, we are encouraging the
                        Belgians to expand their program to include operational unit training and
                        placement of Belgian officers in line units. However, it now seems unlikely
                        that training programs of <pb n="225" facs="0258" xml:id="pg_225"/>those
                        three countries will bear fruit in time both to take on the growing
                        counterinsurgency job and (after June) to provide an effective substitute
                        for the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> forces in maintaining some
                        minimum security in Leopoldville, Katanga, and a few other population
                        centers.</p>
                    <p>In order to help meet the immediate security problem, the United States could
                        supply tactical mobile training teams (MTTs) in order to provide some
                        training to three battalions and appropriate support units in the two
                        important urban areas of Leopoldville and Elisabethville. The use of these
                        teams would not of course guarantee internal security but they would make an
                        important contribution to the training of a limited number of strategically
                        located units. They would represent an added United States role since our
                        efforts have heretofore been confined to supplying equipment and training
                        incidental to the use of that equipment. However, if tactical MTTs were
                        introduced their job would be clearly limited in time and scope and would be
                        designed to supplement and not supplant the training programs of
                        Belgium.</p>
                    <p>Naturally, the United States tactical MTTs could not be introduced in the
                        Congo without the agreement of the Congolese Government. Because of the weak
                        position of that Government, its fear of an adverse political reaction to
                        the introduction of tactical MTTs, and its lack of appreciation of the
                        seriousness of the problem it faces, there will be substantial difficulties
                        in getting its concurrence and in making appropriate arrangements for the
                        introduction of the teams. In addition, because of Belgium’s primary
                        responsibility for <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> training, such a
                        step should not be taken without full prior consultations with the Belgian
                        Government. Neither Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GEA_1">Gullion</persName> nor Ambassador-designate <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> see any satisfactory alternative
                        method of dealing with the immediate problem and both agree that such
                        consultation should be undertaken immediately. Since preparation for the
                        introduction of such teams will consume approximately sixty days, it seems
                        equally important that the Department of Defense begin immediately to make
                        preparations for the introduction of tactical MTTs at the earliest possible
                        time. Once consultation with Belgian and Congolese Governments has begun, we
                        will keep the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Secretary General and the
                        British Government informed.</p>
                    <p>The scope of the additional United States training effort that is suggested
                        is outlined in the contingency plan (enclosed)<note n="2" xml:id="d160fn2">Attached but not printed.</note> which was prepared by the Department
                        of Defense. It calls for the use of 17 technical and tactical MTTs utilizing
                        105 men, to be phased into the Congo for varying periods of time (12–20
                        weeks). This plan is in addition to approximately 7 technical MTTs (33 men)
                        that had already been programmed <pb n="226" facs="0259" xml:id="pg_226"/>
                        for training in the use and maintenance of equipment that the United States
                        is supplying to the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>. The number and
                        location of American military personnel present in the Congo will,
                        therefore, vary from time to time.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation</p>
                    <p>It is recommended that you authorize the Department of State immediately to
                        undertake consultations with the Governments of Belgium and of the Congo
                        with respect to the introduction of a limited number of tactical mobile
                        training teams for the purposes outlined above. This consultation would be
                        conducted on the basis that such teams would be assigned to the Congo on a
                        temporary basis and with a mission clearly limited in scope to the provision
                        of some training to three <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> battalions
                        and appropriate headquarters and support units in Leopoldville and
                        Elisabethville. These consultations would also proceed on the basis that the
                        scope and duration of the activities of such United States teams would be
                        correspondingly reduced or adjusted to the extent that effective additional
                        assistance becomes available from other sources.</p>
                    <p>It is also recommended that the Department of Defense be authorized
                        immediately to commence preparations for an expansion of the United States
                        effort in accordance with the enclosed contingency plan.<note n="3" xml:id="d160fn3">On February 20, <persName corresp="#p_BMG_1">McGeorge

                        <salute>Dear Cy:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>The internal security problem in the Congo continues to give us the greatest
                        concern. Apart from the question of training the Congolese Army (<gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>) which still remains of the utmost
                        importance in terms of our policy goals in the Congo, we are also faced with
                        an insurrection in Kwilu Province which poses a most serious threat to the
                        overall security problem.</p>
                    <p>Our Embassy in Leopoldville, together with Colonel <persName corresp="#p_DWA_1">William Dodds</persName>, the specialist on
                        counter-guerilla warfare detailed to the Congo by <gloss target="#t_CINCSTRIKE_1">CINCSTRIKE</gloss>, believes that if the Kwilu
                        rebellion is not rolled back before the departure of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> troops at the end of June, when the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> must accept sole responsibility for
                        internal security in the Congo, there is serious danger that it will act as
                        a catalyst for other similar insurgencies elsewhere in the Congo. Should
                        this happen, and there is a substantial danger that it will, it would be a
                        matter of grave concern to us, for there is little probability that the
                        untrained <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> would be able to contain
                        another insurrection so long as the Kwilu rebellion remains unchecked.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, the Embassy has recommended strongly that we take steps to roll
                        back the Kwilu insurrection now. The Embassy believes that the only
                        possibility of the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> accomplishing this
                        fairly quickly lies in providing it with some additional equipment and
                        transport capacity. The Embassy has recommended a list of equipment which
                        includes inter alia, helicopters, light aircraft, and vehicles for immediate
                        use in Kwilu. (The list is detailed in Leopoldville’s cables 1580 and 1754
                        to the Department.)<note n="2" xml:id="d161fn2">Dated February 16 and March
                            6, respectively. (Both in National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 23–9 THE
                        CONGO)</note></p>
                    <p>The Department of State fully shares the Embassy’s views of the imperative
                        necessity of ending the insurrection in Kwilu before the departure of the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> forces in June. We, therefore, urge
                        the Department of Defense to develop as a matter of very high priority a
                        program for the supply of such equipment as may be necessary to do the job
                        in Kwilu. In so doing, we are aware that funds within the <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1964 <gloss target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss>
                        program for the Congo will generally not be adequate for this purpose
                        because of important commitments to train the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>. We are therefore exploring <pb n="228" facs="0261" xml:id="pg_228"/> other finance possibilities and request that the
                        Department of Defense will join us on an urgent basis in locating whatever
                        funds may eventually become necessary.</p>

                            a fact-finding trip to the Congo.</note> I called on <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> on March 26. He was relaxed,
                        appeared unworried and in excellent spirits. He showed great pleasure on
                        receiving President’s photograph. Said he was glad to have a chance to talk
                        with me and asked if I had “brought good news.” I explained that the
                        President asked me to visit the Congo to show his personal interest in the
                        Congo specifically and Africa in general. He wanted report on the situation
                        and particularly <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>’s own views
                        on how he saw the future. He was prepared to support <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> and his government if it could be
                        done constructively. <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> then
                        stated he wished to talk about three subjects: Angola, Congo security, and
                        finance.</p>
                    <p>1. Angola. He expressed concern over deterioration of Holden’s position and
                        threat of radical takeover in <gloss target="#t_GRAE_1">GRAE</gloss>. He had
                        offered to serve as mediator between <gloss target="#t_GRAE_1">GRAE</gloss>
                        and Portuguese to bring about round-table talks but had been unsuccessful
                        and hopes for European and American support. He fears <gloss target="#t_Chicom_1">ChiCom</gloss> presence in Brazzaville will
                        increase likelihood of <gloss target="#t_Chicom_1">ChiCom</gloss>
                        penetration of <gloss target="#t_GRAE_1">GRAE</gloss> which might bring on
                        Holden’s overthrow. However, he believes that if Portugal agrees to
                        negotiate, he is prepared personally to guarantee that Holden will maintain
                        a moderate position. However, time is running out, and Holden is under
                        attack as agent of the imperialists for moving too slowly. <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> is fearful of left wing penetration
                        into Congo through <gloss target="#t_GRAE_1">GRAE</gloss> as well as adverse
                        effect on Congo of Communist revolution in Angola. I mentioned US efforts to
                        revive Portuguese-African talks and <pb n="229" facs="0262" xml:id="pg_229"/>reviewed our continuing efforts to bring pressure on Salazar, mentioning
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> visits to Salazar, our
                        pressures on him to accept <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> formula on
                        self-determination, etc. I explained the assistance we were giving refugees
                        in education but we did not know what further action we could take.</p>
                    <p>2. Congo security. In turning to security I expressed our continuing interest
                        in supporting his government and assistance in problem security. <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> stated after four years of <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> presence which was not normal, Congo must
                        now stand on its own without <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> forces. I
                        asked <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> directly whether he
                        trusted his army. He hesitated a moment and then replied “yes and no”, but
                        did not elaborate. He said that <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> had promised substantial increase in Belgian military
                        advisors before June 30 but that greatest need prior to June 30 was not
                        training but transport to assure <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>
                        mobility—helicopters and other air and ground transport. He explained that
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> had sent team here to help in
                        studying these problems looking for early US decision. I said plans for
                        technical training teams to reactivate deadlined vehicles and to train
                        maintenance personnel. He confirmed that he approved this program. In reply
                        to my question as to Belgian encadrement at battalion level, <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> expressed reluctance for fear of
                        provoking mutiny and indicated introduction of Belgians below staff level
                        would have to be handled carefully. He dismissed the police in giving
                        security and indicated that they must rely on USC. The Nigerian police
                        training program was not he maintained a significant contribution to
                        internal overall security. In reply to my question regarding the threat of
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> gendarmerie now in
                        Angola, he agreed that this posed a serious threat to Katanga after June 30
                        but solidly maintained that the government was consolidating its position in
                        Katanga and could take care of threat. He expressed strong opposition to
                        possibility British giving <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        visa. <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> interjected to ask
                            <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> whether there was a
                        possibility of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s returning
                        to Congo political scene. <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>
                        reacted strongly. Said <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> had
                        left Congo on his own volition and had not been threatened. He listed number
                        of Tshombists still here, unharmed and many in high government posts.
                        Reviewing <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> perfidies he
                        declared <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s own past
                        treacheries made him fear return, not Congo Government threats. He ended by
                        stating that if <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> wished to
                        return the initiative was up to him. He seemed quite relaxed about the Kwilu
                        and indicated that the uprising had been contained.</p>
                    <p>3. Economic situation. <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> brought
                        up the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> review just concluded and
                        Mladek’s opinion that the economy was improving. (I had had a talk with
                        Mladek the night before and <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>’s
                        statements substantially confirmed what Mladek had told me.) However,
                            <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> continued, the Congo was
                        not able to do it alone and needed assistance through 1965. I responded that
                        we were willing continue support to <pb n="230" facs="0263" xml:id="pg_230"/>Congo but that Congo’s own actions to control inflation, encourage
                        production and exports was essential as well as contributions from other
                        countries. I explained that we were not willing to be the only contributors
                        both because of our Congressional and public opinion at home and also
                        because it was not wise for the Congo to be dependent on one country. As
                        time was running out because of my engagement with President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>, I said that we could discuss
                        these matters in further detail and that I had another one to add to the
                        list, namely his political problems, the question of the new constitution,
                        the referendum and the elections, and what he was doing to strengthen his
                        own position and that of his party.</p>

                    <p>4614. From <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName>. In one and
                        one-half hour session with <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName>
                        Wednesday afternoon at Consulate, Nice, I covered full range of Congo
                        problems. I began by expressing gratification at Belgian and US military and
                        Embassies in Congo working in complete cooperation.</p>
                    <p>In course of talks, <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> made these
                        undertakings:</p>
                    <p>1. He will talk to Minister of Defense to be sure 100 Belgian officers reach
                        Congo before June 30.</p>
                    <p>2. He will press <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> on
                        forthcoming visit to Belgium to accept Israeli training of two existing
                        battalions immediately.</p>
                    <p>3. He will undertake to raise problem of ex-Katanga gendarmes in Angola in
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and request Portuguese agreement
                        to inspection of Katanga gendarme camps in Angola by agency such as
                        International Red Cross.</p>
                    <p>4. He will attempt to improve Belgian intelligence contacts on <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> capabilities and intentions.</p>
                    <p>5. He will look into political background of certain Belgian professors at
                        Elisabethville and question of Katangan need for Belgian technicians.</p>

                    <pb n="231" facs="0264" xml:id="pg_231"/>
                    <p>6. Belgians prepared explore with us possibilities of providing Belgian crews
                        and perhaps maintenance for possible US-loaned helicopters and combat
                        aircraft.</p>
                    <p>Full account follows:</p>
                    <p>I began with brief review of my trip and, when I mentioned <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> volunteered his concern that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> is over-confident and hard to
                        influence. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> thought <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> had agreed to Israeli training of
                        two battalions, is much concerned at hold up and will talk to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>.</p>
                    <p>We agreed Colonels Mulambe (Stanleyville) and Bobozo (Elisabethville) quite
                        competent, particularly former, and <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> seemed interested in my report that Mulambe thinks
                        that in time <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> will accept Belgian
                        advisers at company level. I mentioned excellent relations of Mulambe and
                        Belgian Col. Dacoster. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> agreed
                        Belgians will keep Dacoster there for another tour.</p>
                    <p>I reviewed our present thinking about need for <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> transport and communications; plans for MTTs; motor
                        transport and spare parts supply; and maintenance training program. I
                        stressed we look to Belgians for major tactical training functions with US
                        in supporting role.</p>
                    <p>I said also we hope to work closely with <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss>
                        on problems of Constitution and election. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> commented on difficulty of getting <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>, like other Africans, to look
                        beyond immediate problems to plan few months ahead. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> stressed <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>’s complacency regarding his
                        political plans and expressed opposition to early Congolese election.</p>
                    <p>In reply to my question about <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s activities, <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> said their intelligence is poor. While some Belgians
                        see him, those who do are unreliable people. He agreed to try to improve
                        intelligence and establish an effective contact.</p>
                    <p>He thinks <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> very mercurial.
                        When <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> saw him in Brussels he
                        was very reasonable, said he had abandoned Katanga secession and talked of
                        entering Leopoldville political scene. But shortly after, he attacked
                            <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> regarding <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>’s death. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> feels probably too late now for
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> play role in <gloss target="#t_Leo_1">Leo</gloss>. He thinks <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> working with some elements in Brazzaville.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> has only general reports re
                        ex-gendarmes in Angola but disturbed by <gloss target="#t_UMHK_1">UMHK</gloss> report of several hundred ex-gendarmes leaving jobs to go
                        join Angola force. Belgian Consul in Luanda has permission visit camps.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> proposes <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> discussion of problem with view to
                        getting Portuguese agreement for International Red Cross inspection of
                        gendarme camps in Angola.</p>
                    <p>I pointed out Portuguese will probably raise Roberto camps in Congo as other
                        side of issue and we discussed Roberto problem briefly <pb n="232" facs="0265" xml:id="pg_232"/>and inconclusively. He said the Belgian
                        Embassy in <gloss target="#t_Leo_1">Leo</gloss> has no contact with
                        Roberto.</p>
                    <p>We talked briefly also of SW Africa problem and <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss> case, and of its relation to Article 19 problem. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> said MacArthur had talked to him re
                        Article 19 and that <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> “has no clear
                        opinion on problem, it is very difficult.”</p>
                    <p>I then reviewed our analysis of 3-part Congo air requirement—airlift,
                        choppers, and either T–6 or AD–6 type combat aircraft. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> agreed it is major factor in <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> ability provide security. I indicated we
                        might supply equipment (on loan basis) and even maintenance but impossible
                        for US provide operating crews and suggested Belgian crews. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> showed interest and said <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> willing to explore further possible
                        Belgian role in operation and perhaps maintenance of choppers and AD–6,
                        providing Italians would not do so.</p>
                    <p>He then listed four short term priorities in this order: more Belgian
                        officers; Israeli training of two battalions; retention of Nigerian troops
                        after June 30; and US supply of air capability. I pointed out Nigerians
                        would require burden-sharing and mentioned that <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> suggested Tunisians as another possible source. He
                        commented Tunisians would be “second best.”</p>
                    <p>I then mentioned minor matter, regarding allegedly Communist Belgian
                        professors in University, Elisabethville, and need for Belgian technicians
                        in Katanga which he agreed to check.</p>
                    <p>With regard to French role in Congo, I reported French Ambassador in <gloss target="#t_Leo_1">Leo</gloss>’s interest in cultural affairs and rumor
                        regarding French military aid. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName>
                        expressed great doubt French prepared to make any substantial contribution
                        in Congo, but would welcome it.</p>
                    <p>On economic matters, I reported impression that large Belgian plantations
                        recovering to pre-independence production but vicious circle of inadequate
                        consumer goods incentives and consequent low production holding native
                        agriculture at low level as well as inadequate transport. I mentioned also
                        estimate by Mladek of <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> that economy on
                        upgrade, and US intention to continue import credit support. Although he
                        agreed, he appeared reluctant to discuss further commitments regarding
                        Belgian import credits.</p>
                    <p>He seemed gratified by my report that <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> had expressed satisfaction over his financial
                        agreements with <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName>.</p>
                    <p>With regard to Brazzaville, <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName>
                        feels it is dangerous base for subversion of Congo–Leo and that French
                        influence there is diminishing rapidly. However, he will talk with French
                        when opportunity offers about Brazzaville problem.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> I told <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> I would expect to keep in close touch on African

                    <p>The President said he had seen <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName>’s tentative recommendations and thought we would be
                        doing very well if we could handle the problem with a matériel program of
                        the size indicated.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> said that it would require
                        further discussions with the military to give the President precise
                        recommendations but that the cost of the transport airlift and air combat
                        program being contemplated would probably be under $10 million. However,
                        this will require an increase in the present $3.5 million Congo <gloss target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss> budget. He also stressed the need for

                        Brazzaville; and indicated he thinks early elections in the Congo would not
                        be a good idea. With a reasonable amount of help from ourselves and other

                    <p>The President opened the meeting with the Congressional Leaders by saying
                        that his purpose was to bring them up to date on recent developments.
                        Various Council members would report on current situations. He first called
                        on Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> for a summary of
                        developments in Brazil.</p>

                    <p>The President then introduced Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> to summarize his recent trip to Africa. (A copy of
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName>’s report to the

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> said that there was a
                        potentially explosive situation in the Congo because the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> forces would be leaving in June. He reported
                        increased economic stability in the Congo and said that real progress had
                        been made toward restoring economic health. Production of copper and coffee
                        has now almost reached the level of production prior to the departure of the
                        Belgians. He said that <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> is now
                        governing the State and is a thorough anti-Communist even though he follows
                        a policy of non-alignment.</p>
                    <pb n="235" facs="0268" xml:id="pg_235"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> described the program we
                        are undertaking to assist in training native Congo military forces. The U.S.
                        would contribute to the mobility of Congolese forces by providing trucks,
                        jeeps and transport planes. U.S. repair teams would go to the area on
                        temporary training assignments.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> said the Congo can
                        achieve stability if there is no pressure from outside the country. Leftists
                        in Brazzaville may cause trouble and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> may try a comeback. If both of these forces move
                        against <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>, he will be in real
                        trouble. There is a possibility, however, that Nigeria may come to his
                        assistance in the event either of these forces seeks to overthrow him.</p>

                    <p>Main points of the program:</p>
                    <p>1. Funds are almost all for combat air and airlift capacity—</p>
                    <p>six T28C fighter aircraft</p>
                    <p>six H21 coup lift helicopters</p>

                    <p>aircraft operation and maintenance costs</p>
                    <p>2. We will try to get the Belgians to operate these aircraft; if unsuccessful
                        we will try a civilian contract operation; but in any event US military will
                        not take an operational flight or ground crew function.</p>
                    <p>3. Additional aid may be required if the Congo situation worsens.</p>

                    <p>4. If <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> requests temporary loan
                        of military security forces from other Africans (e.g. Nigerians) we may have

                    <p>1. On 17 November 1961, Special Group approved a proposal to undertake
                        specific covert actions in the Congo in support of the moderate government
                        headed by Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> and
                        authorized the expenditure of up to [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                            declassified</hi>] for this purpose. On April 23, 1963, a progress
                        report was submitted to Special Group which approved the continuation of
                        these covert actions which were programmed for [<hi rend="italic">dollar
                            amount not declassified</hi>]. The [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not
                            declassified</hi>] project outline was initially approved for <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1962 for [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount
                            not declassified</hi>], the <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1963
                        renewal was approved for [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                            declassified</hi>].</p>
                    <p>2. The policy coordination of this project with the Department of State has
                        been singularly close since its inception. The U.S. Ambassador to the Congo
                        has been kept informed at all times and has frequently added his endorsement
                        to station proposals. Coordination with the Chief of the Bureau of African
                        Affairs in the Department of State has been most close and no major steps
                        have been taken without thorough <pb n="237" facs="0270" xml:id="pg_237"/>and detailed discussions both with the Department of State and with the
                        Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>3. The policy guidance laid down by the Department of State to strengthen the
                        moderate elements in the Government of the Congo led by Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> remains the central
                        objective of Project [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>].
                        During the first two years of this project the <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> Government was plagued by a crescendo of political
                        crises which led to a constant recourse to crash ad hoc funding. Because of
                        the immediacy of the crisis of the moment there was never an opportunity to
                        examine a request for support in detail, and the alternative to non-support
                        was the ever present danger that the moderate government would fall, being
                        replaced by extremist nationalists who, without cohesion or program would
                        rapidly reduce the Congo to chaos thereby inviting subversive Communist
                        activities. This approach did succeed in that the <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> Government has maintained itself in
                        power to some extent through this device of crisis-funding and has survived
                        not only the threat of the Katanga secessionist regime, but several
                        political crises notably in November 1962 and March 1963.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Political Program:</hi> In an effort to get away from
                        this crash funding and bring some order and organization to the political
                        operations of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>
                        and his close colleagues [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] negotiations were begun with them in the Fall of
                        1963. It was made abundantly clear to the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                            line not declassified</hi>] that the U.S. Government was not going to
                        continue the ad hoc funding and would require from them an organized program
                        leading to the formation of a national political party which would act as
                        their political instrument in the anticipated national elections.</p>
                    <p>5. A detailed budget was hammered out with the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                            line not declassified</hi>] (the details of which are given in
                        Attachment B) looking towards the formation of <gloss target="#t_RADECO_1">RADECO</gloss> (Rassemblement Democratique Congolaise). The Ambassador
                        participated in discussions on this budget and urged their favorable
                        consideration. The Chief of the Bureau of Central African Affairs also
                        participated in these discussions. Approval was given by the Department of
                        State and a cable was sent to the field on 8 November 1963 authorizing a
                        budget of [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] for these
                        purposes.</p>
                    <p>6. The station is satisfied that the funds are being expended for political
                        ends in support of the <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>
                        Government if not in adherence with the budget outline. The station is
                        obtaining accountings on those hard currency expenditures in Europe, but
                        despite all efforts cannot obtain accountings for funds expended locally.
                        Realistically, even if procured, such accountings would be relatively
                        meaningless. One built-in protection, however, is that the passage of funds
                        is always known to at <pb n="238" facs="0271" xml:id="pg_238"/>least two of
                        the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] thereby

                        guidance but a 90-day review clearly showed that the <gloss target="#t_RADECO_1">RADECO</gloss> organization had barely gotten off
                        the ground. The Chief of Station has been given authority to suspend
                        payments of funds. Although he has not fully exercised this authority yet,
                        by dragging his feet on the last installment, and giving the recipients a
                        rather blunt lecture, has paved the way for a total suspension or a
                        thorough-going revision of the current budget. Headquarters has also made
                        its dissatisfaction bluntly clear to [<hi rend="italic">5 lines not

                    <p>8. The dissatisfactions with the organization of <gloss target="#t_RADECO_1">RADECO</gloss> are now well known to all the principals and even the
                        Congolese have admitted its shortcomings. The station is now in a position
                        to examine coldly with the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] without mincing words, the political problem of their

                        been authorized by Special Group in April 1963 for General Joseph D.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, the Commander-in-Chief
                        of the Congolese National Army. General <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has been able to scotch at least one attempted
                        military coup against the government and has remained loyal throughout to
                        the <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> Government.</p>
                    <p>10. The Special Group also authorized in April 1963 support to the Congolese
                        National Army in order to retain its loyalty under General <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> to the incumbent moderate regime.
                        This authorization was not called upon until March 1964 when the station
                        requested, with the endorsement of the Ambassador, that support should be
                        provided the Congolese National Army at the rate of [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] per month at least for the balance
                        of <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1964, at which time the arrangement
                        would be renegotiated in light of existing circumstances.</p>
                    <p>11. This support was frankly intended to help maintain this key member of the

                        present position at a time when he was under fire by the violent exile
                        opposition operating out of Brazzaville, and through his efforts to ensure
                        the continued loyalty of the Army. The funds would be used largely to
                        improve the <pb n="239" facs="0272" xml:id="pg_239"/>amenities of the
                        officers, for amelioration of messes, and possibly small emergency loans to
                        deserving army personnel.</p>
                    <p>12. This matter was approved after coordination with the Department of State
                        and cabled authorization was given on 5 March 1964 for the station to expend
                        up to [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] through June
                        1964. It was agreed at that time with the DDP/PG/CA that the [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] project outline would be
                        amended to cover this additional amount.</p>

                    <p>1. This memorandum presents a status report on the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> program for assistance to the Congolese Air Force.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi></p>
                    <p>A. From January through March 1963, <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>,
                        with Special Group approval, covertly furnished to the Congolese Air Force
                            (<gloss target="#t_CAF_1">CAF</gloss>) pilot and maintenance personnel
                        and assorted supplies for the operation and maintenance of 6 Harvard T–6
                        aircraft which are the property of the <gloss target="#t_CAF_1">CAF</gloss>.
                        In April 1963, in coordination with the Departments of State and Defense, a
                        determination was made to expand this activity to include additional
                        aircraft, pilot and maintenance personnel. In February 1964, as a result of
                        the Kwilu uprising, the Department of State concurred in shifting the
                        mission of the air support program from a non-combat, psychological effort
                        to an active combat participation.</p>
                    <p>B. Anticipating the June 1964 withdrawal of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> forces in the Congo in face of an active Kwilu rebellion,
                        President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>, on 24 April 1964,
                        approved a Department of State recommendation to provide to the <gloss target="#t_CAF_1">CAF</gloss> on a loan basis six T–28 aircraft, and to
                        provide on a grant basis ten H–21 aircraft through the Military Assistance
                        Program. In the absence of Belgian or Italian willingness to fly the T–28s
                        in <pb n="240" facs="0273" xml:id="pg_240"/>combat, <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> has been requested by the Departments of State and Defense
                        to provide the necessary personnel to maintain a T–28 combat
                            capability.<note n="2" xml:id="d168fn2">On May 28, the 303 Committee

                        <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> intends to add a helicopter rescue
                        capability for the air support program, and to operate the T–28 aircraft as
                        replacements for the original Harvard T–6s for a period of one year
                        beginning 1 July 1964, or to terminate this activity should the Belgians
                        assume responsibility.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Discussion</hi></p>
                    <p>A. The continuance of an active air support program for the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> is necessitated by both political and
                        military considerations. Originated as a psychological effort to enhance the
                        prestige of the <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> government
                        when it was faced with the politically demoralizing Katanga secession and
                        the militarily superior Katangan air force, this support program was
                        continued after the Katangan conflict when it was determined that withdrawal
                        of this air arm would be interpreted by both Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> and Commander-in-Chief General
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> as a strong indication of
                        a U.S. policy decision to withdraw its support of the present Congolese
                        Government. The advent of the Kwilu uprising in February 1964 added a
                        genuine military significance to this support program, and the decision was
                        made by the Department of State to accede to a <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> request to fly the T–6 Harvards in combat, using .30
                        caliber machine guns and rockets. Although this force has been an effective
                        deterrent to the Kwilu revolt, the revolt continues. Upon withdrawal of the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> forces in June, the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> will be faced with the Kwilu situation as
                        well as a possible security threat in the Katanga and Kivu areas.</p>
                    <p>B. The U.S. Government has attempted to persuade either the Italian or
                        Belgian Governments to furnish pilot and maintenance crews for the aircraft
                        provided by the U.S. Department of Defense. The Italians have deferred
                        flying in combat areas to the Belgians. The latter have agreed to fly the
                        unarmed C–47s and H–21 helicopters in combat areas, but have not reached a
                        decision on operating the armed T–28s.</p>
                    <p>C. While it is possible that the Belgians would cooperate with <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> personnel and support them with a
                        helicopter rescue unit, there is no way of insuring control over such a
                        unit. <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> is prepared to provide necessary
                        personnel to establish a helicopter rescue capability under the direct
                        control of <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> operational personnel, and
                        to supply the necessary pilot and maintenance personnel to operate the armed
                        T–28 aircraft in lieu of the Harvard T–6 aircraft. The latter aircraft are
                        already <pb n="241" facs="0274" xml:id="pg_241"/>considered unsafe to fly in
                        combat conditions and will be retired on or about 1 July 1964. It is
                        anticipated that unless the Belgians agree to fly the T–28s in combat, this
                        activity will continue at least for an additional year at an annual cost of
                            [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>], exclusive of
                        those spare parts and ammunition furnished by the Department of Defense.
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> has the necessary funds for this
                        activity.</p>

                    <p>On 28 April 1964 the Station and American Ambassador to the Congo, G.M.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>, reviewed the
                        six-month-old effort to assist Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Cyrille Adoula</persName> and the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                            not declassified</hi>] in the formation of a national political party.
                        They reached the following conclusions, which agree in substance with those
                        of Headquarters:</p>
                    <p>1. No national political party has yet been formed.</p>
                    <p>2. A homogeneous national party will not be formed in the foreseeable future.
                        A probable alternative is the formation of one or more election alliances
                        grouping various strong provincial single parties.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> has not effectively
                        utilized the funds provided for the organization of a national political
                        party. The Station and <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>
                        recommend cutting in half the political party subsidy in an effort to force
                            <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> into effective
                        action.</p>
                    <p>This recommendation is prompted by the belief that <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> will achieve a more durable party
                        coalition on the basis of straight party program principles than on the
                        basis of the bought or rented loyalties of <pb n="242" facs="0275" xml:id="pg_242"/>selected regional strongmen. Predictably <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> would regard such a cut, as he has
                        past financial denials, as a sign the U.S. has lost confidence in him.</p>

                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Summary:</hi> On 22 November 1961, the Special Group
                        authorized [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] for
                        covert actions in the Congo in support of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Cyrille Adoula</persName>’s moderate government. On
                        23 April 1963, the Special Group authorized [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount
                            not declassified</hi>] for the continuation of this program. To date
                        covert support of <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>’s
                        government has cost a total of [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                            declassified</hi>].</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Problems and Progress:</hi> Timely application of covert
                        funds has been instrumental in maintaining in power the <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> government for the past three
                        years. Efforts to organize a moderate national party, however, have been
                        somewhat less successful, and no such party has materialized to date.</p>
                    <p>The Congolese National Army, currently a potential force for stability in the
                        Congo, will assume even broader significance with the withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> forces from the Congo on 30 June 1964.
                        Accordingly, it is planned to increase covert aid to <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> Commander-in-Chief <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>. Such aid in the past has helped to
                        retain the loyalty of <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> officers to the
                            <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> government and to
                        discourage opposition efforts to penetrate the army.</p>
                    <p>The public relations mechanism established in November 1961 has been
                        providing public relations guidance to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> and has been successful both
                        domestically and outside the Congo (L).</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Coordination:</hi> All major steps in the covert action
                        program for the Congo have been closely coordinated with the Department of
                        State and <pb n="243" facs="0276" xml:id="pg_243"/>the U.S. Ambassador to
                        the Congo. The Ambassador to the Congo, G.M. <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>, favors continuation of this program.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Conclusions:</hi> The organization of a national
                        political party has failed to materialize, and a review of the party program
                        and possible alternatives currently is in progress. A generally agreed upon
                        alternative is the creation of a united-front coalition of regional
                        political groups and leaders, rather than the originally-envisioned single,
                        national party.</p>
                    <p>The moderate, pro-Western Congo regime will continue to require major covert
                        political support for the foreseeable future. The anticipated commitment is
                        estimated at [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>]. Should
                        the postponed national elections be held in <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1965, an additional [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                            declassified</hi>] would be required for an election campaign.<note n="3" xml:id="d170fn3">The minutes of the May 21 Special Group meeting
                            recorded that the Group noted the paper, and that “Mr. Hughes indicated

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. <hi rend="italic">Situation:</hi></p>
                    <p>A. Since November 1962, <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> has been
                        providing covert personnel and logistical support to the <gloss target="#t_CAF_1">CAF</gloss>. In February 1964, upon the outbreak of
                        the Kwilu revolt in the Congo, the non-combat, psychological mission of the
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> unit was changed with State
                        Department approval to one of active combat participation.</p>
                    <p>B. On 24 April 1964, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> authorized the Department of Defense to provide to
                        the <gloss target="#t_CAF_1">CAF</gloss> six T–28, ten C–47, and six H–21
                        aircraft, plus a six month supply of parts and ammunition. In the absence of
                        Belgian crews to operate the T–28s, the Department of Defense and <gloss target="#t_AF_1">AF</gloss> Bureau in State have informally requested
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> to provide the necessary personnel
                        to operate and maintain the T–28s in addition to the T–6s.</p>
                    <p>C. Expansion of <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>’s present program to
                        include operation of the T–28s doubles the potential of air support to the
                        Congolese National Army. At the same time, however, this expansion means
                        doubling the present size of the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> unit
                        and thus reduces the security of the operation.</p>

                    <p>To provide the <gloss target="#t_CAF_1">CAF</gloss> with a combat air

                    <p>High level interagency meeting held May 22 to review present situation Congo
                        (Leopoldville) and possibilities for further action designed to assist in
                        meeting present crisis. Grave view taken of current developments
                        particularly in Kivu. It appeared that crisis originally expected to occur
                        following <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> withdrawal June 30 already
                        underway. Review of present US military program for improving transport and
                        mobility <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> appeared progressing
                        satisfactorily as well Belgian and Italian cooperation this respect. It was
                        concluded following are principal problem areas:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Urgent need for presence Belgian officers in <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> line units</hi>. Fully appreciate
                        background this subject, natural hesitancy of Belgians in light previous
                        experience place officers in local commands and similarly hesitancy of
                        Congolese to request Belgians to do so. Notwithstanding, we of opinion that
                        presence of Belgian officers Kivu might have avoided present disintegration
                        of command.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">General <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName></hi>. While General has many qualities and has
                        performed effectively in past, his vanity and irresponsibility would appear
                        to have contributed significantly to ineffectiveness and disarray <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>. Remains to be seen how he performs on

                        Would accordingly seem desirable explore additional channels for
                        communication with <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> (possibly
                        through individuals such as <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Nendaka</persName>
                        or Marliere) in order for us to get across our ideas to him. In this
                        connection, opportunities should continue to be sought to induce <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> to accept further training by

                        Best approach would seem raising this issue with <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_SYG_1">SYG</gloss> or in <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>. As to <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, initiative

                        on recommendation Osorio Tafal. Nigerians or possibly Senegalese might

                        regarding this matter to Mwami and Burundi delegation here, but Belgians
                        have greater assets for exercising pressure on Burundi. Reported Burundi

                        Burundi or retaliatory actions by Congo (L) against Brazza would be highly
                        undesirable. Despite erosion French influence Brazza, French may still be
                        able to take helpful action Brazza re <gloss target="#t_CNL_1">CNL</gloss>.
                        At same time every consideration must be given to sensitivity of both Congos

                    </p>
                    <p>We wholeheartedly endorse concept of Belgian preparedness to act in
                        emergency, and should necessity for intervention arise, our agreement
                        thereto would certainly entail our willingness to stand by Belgians and give
                        full moral and political support.</p>
                    <p>We fully agree would be most helpful if Belgian Government gave verbal
                        assurances to Congolese Government it prepared assist militarily if
                        necessary. Given special Belgian-Congolese relations, Belgium is in position
                        make unique contribution to security free world by preventing disintegration
                        Congo and possible takeover by elements hostile to West. Belgian willingness
                        give such commitment would undoubtedly bolster morale of Congolese
                        Government now shaken by events Kivu.</p>
                    <p>We assume, however, that <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> would
                        first wish make sure that request for secret pact was made on behalf
                            <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and does not simply constitute
                        idea floated by <persName corresp="#p_LMA_1">Lengema</persName> on own. It
                        seems to us as practical matter that in light present alignment of Congolese
                        political and military forces, were <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> ever make specific request for Belgian military
                        intervention, request should have firm approval of <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and concurrence or at least
                        non-opposition of <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>.</p>
                    <p>We of opinion disadvantages outweigh advantages to be gained from existence
                        secret written pact including legal basis prepared in advance for
                        intervention. If document to have any validity would presumably require
                        approval <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> cabinet, or at least its key
                        figures, with resultant likelihood matter would become public knowledge as
                        Congolese Cabinet not secure. If this happened it would provoke strong
                        Afro-Asian and Bloc reaction creating unnecessary embarrassment for <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> and jeopardizing position of <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> Government in Congolese domestic
                        scene and in many parts Africa. Secret verbal assurances would seem
                        sufficient for purpose.</p>
                    <pb n="248" facs="0281" xml:id="pg_248"/>
                    <p>We believe moreover that <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> would wish
                        qualify such assurances by making clear to <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>
                        that military intervention could not be automatic whenever and wherever
                        Congolese requested, but that final Belgian decision would have to be taken
                        in light all factors obtaining at that time. It is assumed that in any event
                        assurances would only apply after June 30. In addition Congolese request
                        would have to be made in writing according Congolese constitutional
                        procedures (i.e. having approval of Chief of State as well as of Government)
                        and Congolese would have to be prepared make such request public in view
                        likely international repercussions.</p>
                    <p>If <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> agrees with foregoing, we
                        would expect, were <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> to receive request
                        for military forces and if our moral and political support were desired,
                        that <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> would consult urgently with us in
                        order that we might have chance review with Belgians whether or not such
                        military forces seemed required.</p>

                            [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] or other entourage.
                        Though we far from certain how present muddle will resolve itself, we
                        reasonably optimistic that with fast footwork and pertinent decisions <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> can maintain its position vis-à-vis
                        any of the more probable successor regimes to that of [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>].</p>
                    <p>2. Must bear in mind however that <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss>
                        has for so long been associated in so many minds with unequivocal [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] support that if we were
                        to adopt traditional policy of “watchful waiting” toward any new regime such
                        posture would almost certainly be misinterpreted by that regime. We have
                        gone for broke for so long that our reservoir of trust among [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] is disturbingly low.</p>
                    <p>3. While we might be able count on Congolese venality and lust for power to
                        enable us to buy our way through any immediate crises, such tactics would
                        seem to return us to mid-62 morass rather than moving us ahead toward goal
                        of united and stable Congo. However difficult a nettle it may be to grasp,
                        it our conviction that there are all sorts of political figures in Congo who
                        while strongly anti-Communist simply do not like [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] or his associates. Given
                        basically conservative character [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            3</persName>], it seems highly likely these figures will play key role
                        in new regime.</p>
                    <p>4. Thus believe it incumbent on us to begin deciding which of these figures
                        we (<gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss>) can work with, can
                        influence, and therefore should support.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is further discussion of the political situation.]</p>
                    <p>5. While we cannot argue with conviction that <gloss target="#t_CDA_1">CDA</gloss> has yet become impressive political organization, mass
                        forces it claims to represent may be more formidable than those which [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] and/or <gloss target="#t_RADECO_1">RADECO</gloss> have rallied up to now. <gloss target="#t_RADECO_1">RADECO</gloss> currently <pb n="252" facs="0285" xml:id="pg_252"/>negotiating with Conakat and MNC/Kiwewa, but outcome
                        these negotiations remains very much an open question. And this seems to us
                        to be crux of problem. However desirable national party and “apolitical”
                        government may be, neither seem to be in cards for Congo at present time.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SCC_1">Strong</persName> leader might make these
                        goals feasible, but even [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                        4</persName>] had his problems. Thus inclined believe we should recognize
                        political appeal of regional groupings and alliances, and try to influence
                        and focus them on one objective—unified Congo. [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym
                            not declassified</hi>] have obviously tried political alliance system,
                        but in terms of mass support they have always dealt from weakness. Popular
                        dissatisfaction with [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>]
                        inability solve overwhelming problems overnight has only underscored this
                        weakness. Ineffectiveness [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not

                    <p>Both the political and military situations in the Congo are very confused.
                        The government is weak, political unrest is growing, the army is unreliable,
                        and insurgency is spreading.</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Politically</hi> a “transition government” will take
                        over by June 30, looking to a new constitution and elections. <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> is at the low point of his power
                        and prestige, and there is a lot of intrigue and maneuver. <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> seems completely indecisive and
                        incapable of action. However, the best bet for the new government is still
                            <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> with a broader base to
                        the right and, perhaps, to the moderate left (which the Belgians are
                        demanding). We probably have enough influence to force a change of
                        government but not to control the outcome—and it’s doubtful change <pb n="253" facs="0286" xml:id="pg_253"/>would solve much. We continue,
                        therefore, to play a waiting game, maintaining support for <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> for want of a better
                        alternative.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Militarily</hi> the Congo army (<gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>) has been almost a complete failure in the Kivu rebellion;
                        well armed troops are being routed by Pygmies carrying spears and machetes.
                        The rebellion is largely tribal with no real evidence of foreign
                        intervention or supply. However, rebels now have some arms and equipment
                        captured from the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>. After taking several
                        towns and routing the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> the rebels have
                        been quiet the past week. This weekend the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> began a counter offensive, have gone a few miles south and
                        reoccuppied a town formally [<hi rend="italic">formerly</hi>?] rebel-held,
                        but now seem to be stalled even though there is no resistance. If the rebels
                        counterattack the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> will probably run
                        again and there is no significant evidence of <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> leadership or fighting ability. If the rebels take Bukavu,
                        which could well happen, there may well be a serious political crisis in
                        Leopoldville and new fighting in other places, particularly
                        Stanleyville.</p>

                    <p>A memorandum prepared in the Central Intelligence Agency on June 18, 1964,
                        briefed Director of Central Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_MJA_1">McCone</persName> on U.S. assistance to the Congolese Air Force. The
                        occasion was a meeting the same day of the Special Group (<gloss target="#t_CI_1">CI</gloss>) at which the participation of two American
                        pilots in combat missions in the Congo was discussed. According to the
                        memorandum, on June 11, 12, and 13, “under heavy pressures from the
                        hard-pressed Congolese, these men exceeded their authority and flew
                        operational missions in the Kivu area.” On June 8 the field had been “cabled
                        instructions on the limitations on operational involvement of the American
                        pilots, restricting them to reconnaissance.” The pilots were contract
                        employees of <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and had signed contracts
                        with General <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> for the
                        Congolese Government. When first questioned about the matter, the memorandum
                        stated, the Department of State had said it had no knowledge that American
                        personnel were engaged in air operational activity in the Congo, but on June
                        16 the Department indicated it had checked with the Embassy and had been
                        informed that some American civilian pilots under contract to the Congo
                        Government had flown sorties in the last few days. (Central Intelligence

                    <p>In reviewing authorization for U.S. assistance to the Congolese Air Force,
                        the memorandum noted that on December 7, 1962, the Special Group had
                        approved a proposal presented by <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, based
                        on recommendations from the U.S. Ambassador in Leopoldville and the
                        Department of State, to increase the capability of the Congolese Air Force
                        to the extent of enabling it to operate with armament in the eastern regions
                        of the Congo for morale and reconnaissance purposes. Then, at its meeting on
                        May 28, 1964, the Special Group approved expansion of that assistance with
                        the operational objective of providing “the <gloss target="#t_CAF_1">CAF</gloss> with a fighter aircraft capability to render combat air
                        support to the Congolese National Army in suppressing the present
                        insurgencies, as well as any possible future insurgencies which might erupt
                        as a result of the withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> forces.”
                        The memorandum also noted that the Special Group authorization of May 28,
                        1964, included the following statement: “In February 1964, as a result of
                        the Kwilu uprising, the Department of State, at the request of the
                        Government of the Congo, authorized shifting the mission of the air support
                        program from a non-combat, psychological effort to an active combat
                        participation.”</p>
                    <p>According to the minutes of the Special Group (<gloss target="#t_CI_1">CI</gloss>) meeting at 2 p.m. on June 18, the following discussion took

                        strikes, Bukavu would have probably fallen before the rebel advance. He
                        informed the Group that these Americans were hired by the Congolese

                    <p>For eighteen months a group of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not

                            [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] has been
                        flying US-supplied T6 planes in support of the Congo army. The T6s have now
                        been replaced by T28s. The operation is managed and trained by two American
                        civilians. They were under certain restrictions but did do some
                        reconnaissance and combat missions in the Kwilu this spring, but were
                        subsequently ordered to do no more combat missions.</p>
                    <p>The two Americans were under heavy local pressure during the past two weeks,
                        however, to fly combat in the Eastern Congo crisis, as the only pilots
                        already trained to fly the T28s. They did so, and their contribution was
                        probably decisive in temporarily saving the Kivu. It would be hard to second
                        guess their decision now by hindsight.</p>
                    <p>However, our press handling of the problem here is open to criticism. After
                        several days of press rumors, and in response to questions last Monday,
                        State said “The Department’s present information is” no American civilian
                        pilots are flying combat. [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines not
                        declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>As a result, on Tuesday State told the press that we had now learned some
                        American civilians had in fact “flown T28 sorties in the past few days.” On
                        Wednesday in response to further questions, State said the contract pilots
                        had violated no US law but that we now had an understanding that the Congo
                        Government would no longer use them for operational missions. After that
                        interest began to die down.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comment:</p>
                    <p>The actual combat flying in the Congo was not the cause of our trouble. Press
                        handling was, even though there was ample high-level consideration of the
                        problem each day, in which I participated.</p>
                    <p>In retrospect we made three mistakes. We gave a qualified answer before we
                        knew the facts and then had to retract. We were too slow, once the story
                        broke, in giving the press an adequate explanation, so the story snowballed
                        on a speculative basis for several days. Undoubtedly encouraged by some
                        people in State looking for a scapegoat, the press made this into a
                            State–<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> fight; some papers implied, I
                        think unfairly, that <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> had engaged in
                        tricky dealing. The result, in addition to bad publicity on <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and damage to our general credibility, is
                        of course to cast doubt on our operations not only in the Congo but in
                        Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>In part the handling of the story was just bad judgment and we just have to
                        learn from the experience. Beyond that, State is trying to prevent any
                        further gossip to the press about <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>.
                        Also, because part of our trouble was inadequate briefing of the press, we
                        are systematically back-grounding key reporters so that they will have
                        better information on the Congo and we can avoid speculative stories.</p>

                    <p rend="center">THE SITUATION IN THE CONGO (U)</p>
                    <p>1. The situation in the Congo is deteriorating rapidly, and both the public
                        news and the intelligence reports indicate that the central government has
                        little, if any, control over the course of events. The <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> forces, except for some Nigerian troops,
                        have left the country. The Congolese National Army is an almost useless
                        instrument.</p>
                    <p>2. There are clear signs that the Communists are exploiting the growing
                        chaos. The Committee of National Liberation has had financial aid and
                        guidance from both the Soviets and the Chinese; there are Chinese and Czech
                        agents along the Burundi border in the east; and <persName corresp="#p_MPI_1">Mulele</persName>, the leader of the revolt in Kwilu,
                        was trained by the Communists in China.</p>
                    <p>3. Some moves are underway to promote bilateral arrangements by which the
                        incumbent Congo government would receive troop assistance from other
                        countries. It is not yet clear whether such efforts will be fruitful.</p>
                    <p>4. The consistent US policy has been to support a Congolese government of
                        coalition moderates and attempt to enforce control by <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>-supported military efforts. In four years of
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> presence, no Congolese government,
                        either under Premier <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> or his
                        predecessor, has been successful in establishing order.</p>
                    <p>5. The Council suggests that the situation is now so unpromising that the
                        basic US policy should be reconsidered. It is further suggested that, since
                        the “moderate coalition” concept has failed, the time has come to back a
                        strong leader who is opposed to the Communists. The only man who now meets
                        this description is <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, and if
                        we are to accept the reality that the moderate coalition concept has failed,
                        it would seem that we have little choice but to support <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> if we are to improve the political
                        situation. Only if this political situation is stabilized is there any hope
                        that military force (native or other) could be effective in establishing
                        order under a government which would be either neutral or pro-Western rather
                        than Communist.</p>
                    <p>6. It is perhaps an over-simplification to say that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> is a creature of the Union Minière
                        and of the Belgians, but it is fairly safe to say that he would be “on our
                        side” if we were to help him. Certainly he is a <pb n="260" facs="0293" xml:id="pg_260"/>strong leader in Katanga; he does command some
                        loyalties among other Congolese in addition to control of his own
                        gendarmerie; and the chances are that he could establish control and order
                        in Katanga initially, and, from this base, eventual control of the rest of
                        the country. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> could be
                        supported either as a member of, or a replacement for, the present
                        government.</p>
                    <p>7. There are many facets to a proposal to back <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, not the least of which would be the reluctance of
                        the State Department to support a man who was closely associated with the
                        former Belgian colonialism. But, if we do nothing, we will soon watch the
                        Republic of the Congo disintegrate and then emerge as a Communist-controlled
                        entity. Radical changes are needed if this is to be forestalled, and radical
                        changes in our favor will not be achieved through the Organization of
                        African Unity. The answer lies in a different direction.</p>
                    <p>8. a. The best solution would be to have President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> appoint <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> as Premier. If this were to
                        happen, the United States should give strong and overt political support to
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> as the legal
                        government.</p>
                    <p>b. If this overt solution does not come about, we should covertly support
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, [<hi rend="italic">2½
                            lines not declassified</hi>].</p>
                    <p>c. The chances of success under <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, one way or the other, appear to be considerably
                        brighter than those under the present course of events.</p>
                    <p>9. It is, therefore, recommended that the Joint Chiefs of Staff express their
                        concern over the present course of events in the Congo both to the Secretary
                        of Defense and at the next State–<gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss>

                    <p>a. The apparent failure of the present US policy of supporting the
                        broadly-based moderate-coalition type of government;</p>
                    <p>b. The prospects of success if <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> were to be installed as the head of a strong central
                        government, or covertly supported to replace the present government; and</p>
                    <p>c. The problems of rendering support through the Belgians.</p>
                    <p>10. It is further recommended that:</p>

                    <p>2451. Return of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to Congo.
                        Previous US position re ex-Katanga president Moise <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> was based on his efforts establish
                        separate, independent state of Katanga thus threatening fragmentation of
                        Congo. There was no US opposition to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> assuming a role to be determined by Congolese people
                        on national political level or even on provincial level within framework
                        Congolese nation.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> returned to Leopoldville June
                        26 at invitation of President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>. Speculation is rife as to what role he will play in
                        resolution of current Congo crisis. Possibilities include his becoming Prime
                        Minister, assuming an important Ministry, returning to Katanga, returning to
                        exile but there no firm indication of outcome of present maneuvering. On
                        balance we believe chances are good (but less good than a week ago) that
                            <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> will remain Prime
                        Minister.</p>
                    <p>In talks with government officials or other Africans following guidance is
                        provided:</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> views return of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> with some reserve at this point
                        and hopes that he will not be a disturbing factor in Congolese political
                        picture. However determination of his role is a Congolese internal
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>If he can contribute to internal stability in Congo and strengthen unity of
                        country his presence would be useful. He is still a popular and powerful
                        figure in Katanga and we hope he will anchor that key province to rest of
                        Congo. On other hand if his presence would give rise to secessionist
                        tendencies in Katanga or elsewhere <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                        would view return with grave concern.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> has shown himself to be a
                        gifted opportunist in the past. Recently he has associated himself with
                        extremist and leftist self-exiled Congolese politicians, publicly called for
                        a government of conciliation including elements of all tendencies, and paid
                        visit to Mali. These may be efforts improve his image as an African
                        nationalist and thus gain acceptance from Africans who have always opposed
                        him. He may believe that he can use leftists to come into power and then
                        effectively neutralize and eliminate them. However even if this the case his
                            <pb n="262" facs="0295" xml:id="pg_262"/>willingness accept them even
                        temporarily may serve to provide basis for increased Bloc, and perhaps
                            <gloss target="#t_Chicom_1">Chicom</gloss> influence in Congo.</p>
                    <p>Obviously US cannot make decision re <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s future but it following situation closely and
                        hopes that results of political palavers in Congo will result in moderate,
                        independent <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> which can maintain internal
                        peace and order, contribute to strengthening of Congolese unity and take

                        encourage recent economic upturn.</p>

                    <p>In telegram 1711 to the Central Intelligence Agency, July 2, 1964, the
                        Station in Leopoldville reported that the [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not

                        view of the split up of the [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not
                            declassified</hi>] group. If <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Cyrille
                            Adoula</persName> remained in or returned to his present position, he
                        would have a quite different basis of support, and established channels to
                        him were no longer usable. If he lost his present position his principal
                        role then would become leadership of a political grouping and hence any
                        future <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> support would necessarily be on
                        a different basis and presumably at a greatly reduced level. The very
                        fluidity of the situation indicated that it was time to build or solidify
                        channels over a broad spectrum. The Station expected soon to begin receiving
                        feelers and requests for support from many quarters and should be prepared
                        to respond thereto on an interim basis while seeking guidance from
                        Headquarters. (Central Intelligence Agency Files, Job 78–00435R, DDO/ISS

                        temporarily out of action with dysentery. However as background to above,
                        following are [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] impressions of currents
                        and cross currents among [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>]
                        during past week. First fact of life is that [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] and [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] have obviously committed themselves to course of
                        action which designed put [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            2</persName>] into Prime Minister job. Second fact of life is [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>] hostility to [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] whom he considers evil and
                        basically undemocratic. Third element is (somewhat inept) tactics of
                            [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>] in beating drums around
                        town on [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 3</persName>] behalf. Present
                        situation is that all concerned are acutely aware that [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] may end up as Prime Minister
                        and all concerned are trying hedge bets in case this happens as well as in
                        case it does not happen.</p>

                        than we have and because of support for him in non-official Belgian

                    <p>Our ability to work closely with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> if he becomes PriMin will depend in large measure on

                        themselves thereafter. It would give us particular concern if <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> under <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> were to withdraw recognition of <gloss target="#t_GRC_1">GRC</gloss> and subsequently recognize Chicoms, which

                        show his good faith in working toward a territorially intact, economically
                        viable Congo by ensuring that ex-Katangese gendarmes including mercenaries
                        in Katanga and Angola were effectively eliminated as threat to Congo
                        unity.</p>
                    <p>Finally we believe it essential that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> or any other prime minister continue economic
                        stabilization and fiscal austerity programs and resist any policy which

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>’s motives in
                        naming <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> as Prime Minister and
                        giving him the responsibility to form a transitional government are unclear.
                        He may be giving <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> enough rope
                        to hang himself or he may feel that it is necessary to get <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s support to prevent unrest and
                        instability in Katanga. <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> has
                        alleged that he is keeping <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>
                        out of the transitional government in order to keep him available for the
                        future.</p>
                    <p>It seems clear, however, that <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> intends to control the situation more closely than
                        he has in the past and the new constitution which has just been submitted to
                        a national referendum provides for a de Gaulle type of president with the
                        cabinet responsible to him rather than to Parliament. A further indication
                        of this is that he has placed the Defense Ministry in a committee, the
                        membership of which is still unknown, reporting directly to him rather than
                        to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The announced cabinet discards all of the old government, brings in <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s collaborator in Katanga as
                        Interior Minister, makes a gesture to the dissident Committee of National
                        Liberation (<gloss target="#t_CNL_1">CNL</gloss>) by including one of its
                        leaders and includes representatives of four other political groupings as
                        well as two so-called technicians. It is not so broadly representative as
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> seemed to indicate when
                        he called for a government of national reconciliation or as the Belgians
                        wanted. The ability of many of the ministers most of whom do not have high
                        positions in their political parties, is unknown.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and his Katangan colleague,
                            <persName corresp="#p_MGO_1">Munongo</persName>, have concentrated six
                        portfolios and the prime ministership in their hands. Although <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> has awakened many Congolese hopes
                        for an effective and unifying government, this fact may soon cause serious
                        difficulties. The individuals and groups not included will probably not wait
                        long to start harassing him.</p>
                    <p>Immediately after his installation <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> called in our Ambassador and complained of
                        breakdowns of the T–28 aircraft and demanded <pb n="268" facs="0301" xml:id="pg_268"/> immediate operational availability. We are sending a
                        maintenance mechanic to Leopoldville on Tuesday to work on the planes.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> stated that he planned
                        to repatriate his gendarmes, now in Angola, alleging a strength of 4,000, to
                        restore order in North Katanga and retake the provincial capital from the
                        rebels. Chief of Staff <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> was
                        present and raised no objection. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> pointed out these forces would be under Congolese
                        army command. The return of the gendarmes will probably cause strong African
                        criticism of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to whom the
                        Africans in the past have been hostile. After his first cabinet meeting
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> announced that all
                        political prisoners would be released. This presumably includes Gizenga,
                            <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName>’s senior supporter. It
                        is reported that <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> does not
                        want to free him.</p>
                    <p>We believe that we should support <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> in his efforts to promote unity, internal security
                        and economic stability. Our existing economic and military aid programs
                        should be quietly continued. Former Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> believes that there should be no
                        change in this regard. We should also endeavor to strengthen our ties and
                        relations with President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>
                        whose position is so much stronger now. However, until we have a clearer
                        indication of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s intentions
                        by his actions, we should be cautious in not appearing to give him
                        unqualified support.</p>

                            this would only take 24 hours. (Ibid.)</note></p>
                    <p>2. These letters were carried by [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] and close confidant of [<hi rend="italic">name not
                            declassified</hi>] and delivered to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DLA_1">Devlin</persName> in New York on the evening of 17 July 1964. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] instructions are to deliver
                        the original of the letter addressed to the <gloss target="#t_DCI_1">DCI</gloss> personally to the <gloss target="#t_DCI_1">DCI</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>3. While it is not entirely clear what is the exact Congolese purpose in
                        undertaking this action, it seems likely that the letter addressed to the
                            <gloss target="#t_DCI_1">DCI</gloss> [<hi rend="italic">1 line not
                            declassified</hi>]. It should be noted that both [<hi rend="italic">name
                            not declassified</hi>] and <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> have been key movers in arranging the return of
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. Further it has been
                        reported recently that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> is
                        sending emissaries to London, Paris, and Brussels possibly to determine what
                        support his government can expect in those countries.</p>
                    <p>4. [<hi rend="italic">4 lines not declassified</hi>] Recent reporting shows
                        further that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> is concerned at
                        the lack of support which he has both in the Congo and outside. In the Congo
                        it is confined to Katanga and Leopoldville. On the international scene it is
                        confined to Belgium, France and to a lesser extent Great Britain. Reportedly
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> believes that without US
                        public support the British will soon withdraw theirs.</p>
                    <pb n="271" facs="0304" xml:id="pg_271"/>
                    <p>5. Given the uncertainties of the situation in the Congo at the moment, it is
                        difficult for the Department of State to reach a policy decision regarding
                        public backing of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> in the
                        immediate future. For this reason, I recommend against [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] being given an appointment with the
                        Director. On the other hand, in the coming period while the Department is
                        determining what commitment it should make in the Congo it is important that
                        some channel to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> be
                        established and maintained. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]
                        appears to provide this channel. I, therefore, recommend that [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] letter be accepted by a
                        designated representative of the Director. It can be implied that the
                        Director is absent from Washington at this time. I believe further that the
                            [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] proposal that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DLA_1">Devlin</persName> meet with him, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and possibly others be accepted and
                            [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] be told that the Director
                        will give the matter his consideration.</p>
                    <p>6. The division would like to consider with the Department of State the
                        desirability of such a meeting and work out with them the timing and
                        location. [<hi rend="italic">2½ lines not declassified</hi>] <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s isolation from African leaders,
                        the Soviet Bloc, and at the same time the United States places him in a
                        rather weak position and in my opinion he is acutely aware of this. We can
                        conjecture that what [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] and
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> may be seeking is a
                        public statement by the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> endorsing the
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> government.
                        Alternatively, if such a statement is not forthcoming, it may be that [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] will want some indication from
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> as to whom he should back to obtain

                        cities of Stanleyville, Bukavu and Luluabourg and the major Army base at
                        Kamina. Evacuation of Americans from Stanleyville and Bukavu is

                    <p>The fall of one or more of the three cities to the rebels, whose operations
                        have little coordination, when added to the territory already lost by the
                        central government, might lead to foreign recognition of a rebel government.
                        A rebel government has already been proclaimed by <persName corresp="#p_SGE_1">Soumialot</persName> in the eastern Congo. The
                        Congolese National Army (<gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>), lacking
                        officer leadership and discipline, has shown itself incapable of stemming
                        the epidemic spread of the rebels despite our current military aid programs
                        and the help the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> is receiving in
                        advisers, training and matériel from Belgian and other sources. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> has attempted (so far
                        unsuccessfully) to enlist the cooperation of tribal chiefs in support of the
                        central government and to resist the spread of tribal unrest and rebel
                        uprisings.</p>
                    <p>Action we have already taken includes frequent consultations between
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> with President
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>, Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and other Congolese on
                        the internal security threat and how to meet it and instructions to
                        Ambassador MacArthur to urge Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> to make additional officers available either as
                        advisers or to command <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> units. We have
                        also asked our Embassy at Paris to attempt to get the French to use their
                        influence in Brazzaville to restrain the Congolese rebels there.</p>
                    <p>Earlier proposals for the use of foreign troops, preferably from friendly
                        African countries, have not so far appeared feasible because of African
                        reluctance to associate themselves with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s
                        unwillingness to make a request, and the unlikelihood that other African
                        countries would agree to allow their troops to fight Congolese
                        insurgents.</p>
                    <p>Recognizing the worthlessness of the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>,
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> has brought back his
                        ex-Katangan gendarmes from the bush and Angola. To be effective they would
                        require white officers. Some mercenaries have already arrived in
                        Leopoldville. While we wish <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        would choose mercenaries other than South Africans and Southern Rhodesians,
                        who are unacceptable to other African states, to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> they may represent the only
                        immediately available resources to stiffen the gendarmes and the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> is also faced with
                        political opposition in Leopoldville, since he has excluded many ambitious
                        politicians from his government, especially the Binza group, and his
                        relations with President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>
                        are not close. With the government as presently constituted, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> is facing growing political
                        opposition with the Binza group, particularly General <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, and President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> who under the new Constitution

                        for returning [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 5</persName>] to Congo.
                        Although not confirmed, appears he expected obtain future political credit
                        by this action. Also suspect [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            1</persName>] hoped obtain [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity

                            [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 5</persName>] premier. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] confirmed this view at 3 Aug
                        meeting. [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>], however, has
                        stated [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] had already
                        decided give up premiership to [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            5</persName>] when latter recalled. Difficult determine exact role
                        played by [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>]. Latter insists
                        his merely advisory role and carried out [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] instructions in arranging [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 5</persName>] return. However, suspect
                            [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] role in convincing
                            [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] turn govt over to
                            [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 5</persName>] greater than
                            [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] states, or perhaps
                        greater than he realizes. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            1</persName>] could have interpreted [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s] advice as indication [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] withdrawing his support, support which [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] knew he must have to remain in
                        office.</p>
                    <p>D. Basis info available, believe [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] only member of [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not
                            declassified</hi>] who directly involved [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 5</persName>] return and negotiations leading thereto.</p>
                    <p>E. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] apparently decided it
                        useless oppose [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 5</persName>] and thus
                        set out develop close working relationship. Believe this done to try
                        establish foothold in [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 5</persName>]
                        camp for [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>], to permit
                            [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] monitor [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 5</persName>] activities and to serve as
                        holding action pending final evaluation situation. In short, believe
                            [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] and other [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] had no long-term <pb n="276" facs="0309" xml:id="pg_276"/>plan and thus decided they had no
                        alternative but to go along with [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            5</persName>].</p>
                    <p>4. [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] remain without firm
                        plans other than to hope <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> will be
                        able solve Congo security problem. Only political plans [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] able suggest were continued support
                            <gloss target="#t_RADECO_1">RADECO</gloss>, together with parallel
                        effort establish voting block in next parliament based on ex-Orientale
                        province, Ubangi and Cuvette Centrale. They hope such minority block would
                        provide swing vote similar that of Abako in previous parliament. It also
                        clear [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] convinced <gloss target="#t_RADECO_1">RADECO</gloss> stands little or no chance under
                            [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] leadership, as they
                        believe he lacks political sex appeal and leadership qualities.</p>
                    <p>5. In addition to appearance of [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            5</persName>] and his entourage on the local scene, military successes
                        of <gloss target="#t_CNL_1">CNL</gloss> (or perhaps it more exact to say
                        military failures of <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>) have greatly
                        complicated political situation. The [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not
                            declassified</hi>] and probably [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            5</persName>] are desperately anxious head off the <gloss target="#t_CNL_1">CNL</gloss> advance. They believe they have little
                        time to do this, for with every chance of the <gloss target="#t_CNL_1">CNL</gloss> its prestige goes up and the prestige of the govt and
                        indirectly the [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>]
                        (particularly [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] goes down.
                        This based on old African phenomena that nothing succeeds like success or
                        fails like failure. Thus, [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not
                        declassified</hi>] appear be making sincere effort support [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 5</persName>] in face <gloss target="#t_CNL_1">CNL</gloss> danger. Believe this support will continue
                        so long as <gloss target="#t_CNL_1">CNL</gloss> poses actual danger.
                        However, [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] would prefer
                        find solution to <gloss target="#t_CNL_1">CNL</gloss> problem which would
                        enhance their prestige, rather than that of [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 5</persName>]. It to this reason [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] raised question of obtaining ChiNat, Philippine or
                        South Korean troops to shore up his forces. (Note: This earlier reported
                        [U.S. Embassy] channels.)</p>
                    <p>6. Although situation too fluid reach positive conclusions on basis one week
                        consultations, suggest following developments may well come to pass:</p>
                    <p>A. In absence other foreign support, suspect [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 5</persName>] will resort to use mercenaries in his efforts
                        limit expansion <gloss target="#t_CNL_1">CNL</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>B. Use mercenaries, particularly South Africans or white Southern Rhodesians,
                        will cause numerous political problems. Specifically this could well be
                        exploited by <gloss target="#t_CNL_1">CNL</gloss> as “proof” [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 5</persName>] serving as front man for
                        neo-colonialists. Also could result in some outside states collaborating
                        overtly with or even recognizing <gloss target="#t_CNL_1">CNL</gloss>
                        regime. However, use mercenaries might provide extra backbone needed by
                            <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> to defeat revolutionary forces. As
                        of now does not appear [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 5</persName>]
                        will receive sufficient help from more acceptable outside forces and thus
                        very possibly will turn to mercenaries for needed military assistance.</p>
                    <pb n="277" facs="0310" xml:id="pg_277"/>
                    <p>C. If [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 5</persName>] succeeds in
                        solving security problems by using mercenaries, it probable he may take
                        advantage this situation to eliminate [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>]. He might relegate [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] to position minor importance and avoid requesting
                            [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 4</persName>] agreement to
                        latter’s removal. Should this develop would assume [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 5</persName>] also would try eliminate
                            [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] thus insuring his
                        control of army and [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                        6</persName>].</p>
                    <p>D. Assume [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 5</persName>] and [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 4</persName>] eventually will clash in
                        effort win presidency. All persons contacted expect this rivalry to result
                        in power struggle. As of now there appears be little coordination between
                            [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 4</persName>] and [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 5</persName>].</p>
                    <p>E. Although anything can happen and much will depend upon [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] estimate of political power factors,

                        greatly worried and unsure what political future holds for them, as they
                        recognize dangers of [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 5</persName>]
                        and/or <gloss target="#t_CNL_1">CNL</gloss> regime.</p>
                    <p>7. It too early determine whether [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity

                        chance righting situation and confirming his position as key Congo figure.
                        Much depends upon military, political and economic developments of next few
                        months, but it normal in Congo for govt to lose popularity after several
                        months in office. Thus, expect [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity

                        economic break-through ASAP.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is further discussion of the political situation.]</p>
                    <p>9. Current security situation extremely serious and could well result in
                            <gloss target="#t_CNL_1">CNL</gloss> extremists winning control <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>. If Stan falls to <gloss target="#t_CNL_1">CNL</gloss>, as appears probable, Leop situation will become
                        precarious; would expect snowballing situation to result if Stan falls.
                        Should it appear <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> unable prevent <gloss target="#t_CNL_1">CNL</gloss> takeover Leop area, suspect [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 5</persName>] would endeavor return Katanga
                        and establish redoubt there. Thus Congo could once again be split, as during
                        time of Katanga secessionist movement. Difference might be that [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 5</persName>] would represent legal govt.
                        Much will depend upon [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 4</persName>]
                        actions and decisions. If <gloss target="#t_CNL_1">CNL</gloss> victorious

                    <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                    <p>A. In recent months, regional dissidence and violence have assumed serious
                        proportions, even by Congolese standards, and produced the threat of a total
                        breakdown in governmental authority. The difficulties confronting Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> are enormous. His
                        greatest need is a military force which can handle the various rebellions.
                        His political position will be threatened by other aspirants to <pb n="279" facs="0312" xml:id="pg_279"/>power. We think the chances are about even
                        that he will be able to remain Prime Minister over the next six to nine
                        months. If <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> is able to avoid
                        anarchy in the Congo, he will have scored a considerable achievement, but
                        there is little prospect of establishing a central government which will
                        have a substantial degree of authority throughout the country. (Paras. 1–6,
                        11–13, 15–16)</p>
                    <p>B. Should <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> fall, the prospects
                        are dark. Extremists would be likely to gain increased influence in
                        Leopoldville, secessionist regimes might break off and disorder would
                        spread. (Paras. 14, 18)</p>
                    <p>C. We believe <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> will adopt a
                        generally pro-West orientation within the confines of a pro forma
                        non-aligned policy. He will probably remain close to the Belgians and
                        susceptible to their influence; we believe he will cooperate with the US.
                        Although still suspect by many African leaders, we believe <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> would become generally acceptable
                        in Black Africa if he succeeded in providing a workable solution to the
                        Congo’s problems. (Paras. 21–23)</p>

                    <p>2. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] arrived at <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s residence at 1300 hours and
                        introduced himself. He had been dropped off by the Ambassador. After some
                        misunderstanding [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] was ushered
                        into <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s office.</p>
                    <p>3. After brief interval of small talk, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, who was obviously turning on the charm, launched
                        into a long discourse on his boyhood, <pb n="280" facs="0313" xml:id="pg_280"/>the fact that he was educated by U.S. missionaries, and
                        his great affection for the U.S. Government. He concluded by saying that
                        with such a background he could not be suspected of being anti-U.S.
                        Government. However, he noted that U.S. Government authorities had never
                        understood his position and thus, erroneously, misinterpreted his plans and
                        ambitions.</p>
                    <p>4. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] thanked <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> for his frank statement, adding
                        that such frankness deserved an equally frank reply. [<hi rend="italic">name
                            not declassified</hi>] informed <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> that he had served for nearly three years in Leop,
                        adding that he had done his best as an officer of the U.S. Government to
                        implement the U.S. Government Congo policy and that he had sometimes found
                        himself in opposition to all repeat all efforts to divide the Congo. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] emphasized that his actions
                        had been based on the general policy decision to oppose the division of the
                        Congo and not on personal motives. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> replied he well aware of [<hi rend="italic">name not
                            declassified</hi>] background, that he appreciated frankness, that he
                        desired establish a frank relationship with [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                            line not declassified</hi>] all U.S. Government officers and that he had
                        sought this meeting with [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]
                        precisely because he aware of [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]
                        background. He continued saying he understood and respected the reasons for
                            [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] past activities. However,
                        said he must say [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]
                        U.S. Government had been ill advised by persons who for selfish or other
                        reasons had failed provide U.S. Government with a clear understanding of
                        realities of Congo situation. Also, he noted [<hi rend="italic">name not
                            declassified</hi>] and other U.S. officials had failed establish direct
                        contact with him in years past, and he commented that had the U.S.
                        Government conducted frank talks with him at that time that many problems
                        might have been avoided, particularly the current chaotic situation. To keep
                        conversation going on a friendly plane (and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s remarks were made in an apparently friendly and
                        candid manner) [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] avoided
                        pointing out that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> had always
                        had access to the U.S. Consulate Elisabethville. Instead he noted that he
                        had accompanied <persName corresp="#p_TCH_1">Timberlake</persName> to Eville
                        in Nov 60 and that in July 61 he had tried without success to contact
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> in Brazzaville to urge
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to attend the Lovanium
                        conclave.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> implied there might have
                        been some cause for misunderstanding during period of the Eville secession.
                        However, he expressed view that U.S. Government should have accepted at face
                        value his declaration that he was abandoning secessionist efforts and worked
                        for a reconciliation between the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and
                        himself. Added he recognized many persons in the U.S. believe he merely
                        awaiting opportunity lead another secessionist movement, but he explained
                        such a path no longer open to him. He said that, were he to lead again Lunda
                        people in <pb n="281" facs="0314" xml:id="pg_281"/>a secessionist movement
                        and were it to fail, he and his entire family would lose their lives and
                        property, for the tribe would not forgive him for such an error. Said anyone
                        who understood Lunda tribal customs and the danger which he and his entire
                        family would run were he to so act should have understood he had been
                        seeking honest reconciliation with <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>6. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] replied it regrettable that
                        earlier reconciliation had not taken place, but added little could be
                        accomplished by looking to the past. The important point being that
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> had finally returned to
                        Leop, that he heading central govt, that he was prepared to put down
                        rebellion in the provinces and that, as <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> already aware, U.S. Government was prepared continue

                        one repeat one U.S. Govt foreign policy, that contrary to case in some

                            not declassified</hi>] involved in efforts undermine his govt. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] assured <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> this could not be the case as U.S.
                        policy directed by one head and that U.S. policy is as communicated to him
                        by <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> and other U.S. <gloss target="#t_reps_1">reps</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> did not comment on [<hi rend="italic">name not
                            declassified</hi>] matter at that time, but at end of meeting he stated
                        that he fully reassured re [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]
                        and that the matter is closed.</p>
                    <p>7. Taking up the point of U.S. policy, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> said he had found Congo situation much more
                        difficult and dangerous than he had realized it be prior his return Leop. He
                        explained he seeking win back people from “the Communists”; to leave
                        Gizenga, <persName corresp="#p_MPI_1">Mulele</persName> and other extremists
                        without followers. Said he needs U.S. help to accomplish this, for without
                        U.S. Govt economic help over the next five years there no hope of avoiding
                        chaos and Communist penetration of Congo. After <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> had expounded at great length about his need for
                        U.S. help and his desire cooperate with U.S. Govt, and in accordance with
                        suggestions made by Deputy Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fredericks</persName>, urged <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> maintain close contact with <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> and other <gloss target="#t_reps_1">reps</gloss> of US, noting that U.S. Embassy could support <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> only insofar as it fully aware his
                        plans and objectives and thus able to communicate these plans to Department
                        of State. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> acknowledged need
                        for such contact and indicated his willingness work closely with U.S. <gloss target="#t_reps_1">reps</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> said he had been unsure
                        that such U.S. Embassy collaboration would be forthcoming, stating that he
                        aware U.S. Embassy had done everything possible block his return Leop and
                        his nomination as Prime Minister. He admitted these alleged actions
                        preceeded his appointment <pb n="282" facs="0315" xml:id="pg_282"/> as Prime
                        Minister. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] again reassured
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> that U.S. policy is as
                        reported to him by <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>. When
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> implied there might be
                        divergent policies between Washington and U.S. Embassy, [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] repeated there only one Congo policy, and
                        added that were anyone in U.S. Embassy to fail to adhere to this policy line
                        he would face immediate recall.</p>
                    <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> next referred to Radeco,
                        implying it supported by U.S. He did not dwell on this point but assured
                            [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] that <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> finished politically. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>’s only hope was to cooperate with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, that he, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, could and would help <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> retain some position influence if
                            <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> played game. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> concluded comments this point
                        saying U.S. had bet on a poor horse and making it clear he has little
                        respect for <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> as a political
                        opponent.</p>
                    <p>10. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] took advantage ref to
                            <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> to say he, [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] had many friends or contacts
                        in Congo and noted he seeing persons from various political groups in order
                        try provide his superiors with valid appreciation current political
                        situation. Added these contacts made only for purposes obtaining cross
                        section political views and not to oppose <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> regime. Also said had urged upon all contacts need
                        for moritorium on political maneuvering until danger posed by <gloss target="#t_CNL_1">CNL</gloss> rebellion contained. Stressed that
                        contacts based on personal friendship developed over long period and
                        referred to fact that [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] had

                    <p>12. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] stressed importance [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] collaboration,
                        stating primary objective [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not

                        objectives, particularly in view of “fact” <gloss target="#t_CNL_1">CNL</gloss> being exploited by <gloss target="#t_Chicom_1">ChiCom</gloss>s and Sov. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> concurred this point and again repeated his desire

                    <p>164. Please deliver ASAP following message from the Secretary to <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName>:</p>
                    <p>It is our judgment that events in the Congo have reached so critical a point
                        that you and we and all our European friends must move immediately and
                        vigorously to prevent total collapse. We estimate that there is no effective
                        internal security force and none in prospect without outside help.
                        Deterioration is so rapid that Elisabethville, Leopoldville and central
                        government may be gone in next several weeks.</p>
                    <p>Not only is Congo key to central Africa but also chronic instability provides
                        fertile ground for Communist infiltration, prevention of which has been
                        cornerstone our Congo policy last four years. I want you to know that
                        President shares my deep concern over the situation. While appreciating
                        considerations you raised with MacArthur, President and I are convinced that
                        you and we must concert urgently on tangible, specific measures to save the
                        Congo. We agree with you on need to elicit <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s plans and are attempting to do so.</p>
                    <p>In view of the foregoing we are requesting Averell <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> to leave tomorrow to discuss with
                        you what can be done on an emergency basis. I very much hope you and we can
                        develop such a program of action adequate to save the immediate situation. I
                        have asked him to discuss with you the following:</p>
                    <p>1. In view of the vital European interests in central Africa, what assistance
                        might be forthcoming from a joint military force of the Six, or of some of
                        its member nations. What help can we be to you if you should take the lead
                        in the organization of such a European rescue mission. I should think it
                        possible even the French might participate now that <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> military presence has been withdrawn.</p>
                    <p>2. The need for additional military forces in the Congo which we believe
                        Belgium is in the best position to provide. Averell can go into details of
                        what we might be able to do in this connection.</p>
                    <p>3. The measures which your government can take to ensure continued Central
                        Government control of Kamina, Bukavu and Luluabourg and to strengthen the
                        government of Rwanda which is put in <pb n="284" facs="0317" xml:id="pg_284"/>jeopardy by rebel control of the eastern Congo. This probably requires, on
                        an emergency basis at least, that Belgian officers now in the Congo join and
                        exercise de facto command of operational <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> forces in the field.</p>
                    <p>4. Establishment as soon as possible of gendarmerie force with mercenary
                        officers.</p>
                    <p>5. Need for joint efforts on the part of all the Western allies to induce
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to broaden the base of the present
                        government and to gain greater acceptance for it among African states. I do
                        not understand for example why <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> does not utilize <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>, in explaining the Congo problem to the Congo’s
                        African friends and to request support both diplomatic and military from
                        them.</p>

                            August 6, MacArthur reported that he delivered the Secretary’s message

                    <p>Late last night, a message was received from our Consulate at Stanleyville
                        that four of its staff members were in the communications <pb n="285" facs="0318" xml:id="pg_285"/>vault of the Consulate and a fifth was in
                        an apartment building about one mile away (Tab A).<note n="2" xml:id="d198fn2">None of the tabs is attached.</note> The message
                        indicated that in the early hours of the morning the rebels had cut off the
                        Consulate power supply and tried to enter the communications vault. Shortly
                        afterwards, the rebels departed and the Consulate reported that the city
                        seemed quiet before the Consulate staff returned to the communications vault
                        after turning on the power again.</p>
                    <p>Shortly before midnight, Bill <persName corresp="#p_BWH_1">Brubeck</persName>
                        asked us to examine whether it would be feasible to evacuate the Consulate
                        personnel by airlift from Stanleyville. After informally alerting <gloss target="#t_CINCSTRIKE_1">CINCSTRIKE</gloss> of this request, we examined
                        the problem based on information available here. We concluded that no
                        operations involving resources in the Congo could be carried out today. The
                        airport is in rebel hands, and H–21 helicopters could not be flown to the
                        area in sufficient time to carry out rescue operations while daylight
                        remained. More importantly, we could not find any airfield sufficiently
                        close to Stanleyville, from which the H–21s could mount a round trip to
                        Stanleyville. (This also applied to any T–28s that might be used for air
                        cover.)</p>
                    <p>By Tab B, Embassy Leopoldville reported that it planned to carry out a rescue
                        operation involving T–28s and H–21 helicopters along the lines that we had
                        considered impracticable. As a result, we sent the message at Tab C asking
                        for further details from Leopoldville. We have not yet had a response. Tab D
                        outlines <gloss target="#t_CINCSTRIKE_1">CINCSTRIKE</gloss>’s proposed
                        course of action. It involves bringing in between a platoon and a company of
                        US troops by helicopter, presumably to secure the area around the Consulate
                        while the rescue is carried out. The STRIKE plan would involve three or four
                        days of preparation.</p>
                    <p>We informed Bill <persName corresp="#p_BWH_1">Brubeck</persName> this morning
                        of the foregoing. We also raised with him the possibility that the rebels
                        might retaliate against the remaining white population in Stanleyville which
                        is substantial in number if the rescue operation involved any hostilities.
                        We suggested that a more feasible course would be an attempt, through
                        negotiations with the rebels, to arrange for the safe passage of all members
                        of the white population who might wish to leave Stanleyville. The rebels
                        permitted such a safe passage after Albertville fell. <persName corresp="#p_BWH_1">Brubeck</persName> thought this idea had considerable
                        merit, as did representatives of the State Department with whom we discussed
                        it last evening.</p>

                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Situation:</hi> Stanleyville is in rebel hands. All of
                        Eastern Congo may go in next several days; Katanga, Leopoldville and entire
                        Central Government may collapse in next several weeks. Although situation
                        largely the result of tribal violence there is real danger Communists will
                        be able to exploit in near future. Situation is basically power vacuum,
                        could probably be retrieved by small security force (ideally white, at a
                        minimum white-led and, if really good, as few as 1000).</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic"> Problem:</hi> No useable force exists or is now in
                        prospect in Congo. <hi rend="italic">The basic immediate problem is how to
                            get such a force in a hurry</hi>.</p>
                    <p>3. Although <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> flatly declares
                        Belgians can take no significant action, <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> is going to Brussels tonight for a final effort
                        with him. <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> will offer range
                        of alternatives—</p>
                    <p>(a) Belgium provide the white military personnel required (Belgians
                        absolutely refuse, from fear of reprisals against Belgian citizens in rebel
                        held territories).</p>
                    <p>(b) Belgian leadership in organizing a multi-national European force for
                        Congo (very unlikely—other Europeans even less willing than Belgians to
                        commit troops).</p>
                    <p>(c) US-Belgian cooperation to help <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> organize and equip a force of Katanga ex-gendarmes
                        led by white mercenaries (best practical prospect, but <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> so far refuses to let Belgians serve
                        as mercenaries, which is most critical need).</p>
                    <p>(d) Try to get African forces into Congo (Nigerians, Tunisians, etc.)—very
                        doubtful, very complicated and would take time. We would have to compel
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to broaden Congo
                        Government in order to get any African help.</p>
                    <p>4. The <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> talks will probably show Belgians
                        absolutely unwilling to do anything except perhaps supply and equip
                        mercenary-gendarmes force. If so, by this weekend the problem of short run
                        salvage of Congo will be squarely in our laps, raising questions—</p>
                    <pb n="287" facs="0320" xml:id="pg_287"/>
                    <p>(a) How much support are we prepared to give mercenary force (e.g. covert
                        recruiting, US money, etc.) as first choice?</p>
                    <p>(b) If this fails how tough will we get in ultimatum to Congo Government to
                        compel changes necessary to get African force into Congo?</p>
                    <p>5. If these efforts fail and/or continued disintegration forces our hand (as
                        is possible) we are reduced to three alternatives—</p>
                    <p>(a) Go back to <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Security Council and try to
                        make a deal with Russia to permit a new <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                        force in Congo.</p>
                    <p>(b) Explore putting in small US force or US-Belgian force on short term
                        basis.</p>
                    <p>(c) Let the chaos run its course, hoping the Congolese will work out an
                        adjustment without serious Communist intrusion; and rely on Congo’s need of
                        our aid and support for influence with the eventual government. This would
                        be hard to explain politically in US, but it is essentially what Belgians
                        and Europeans are doing.</p>
                    <p>6. My own feeling is the practical alternative offering early results on
                        which we should concentrate now is to help the Congolese in every way to
                        organize a mercenary-led force and, at same time, use our heaviest pressures
                        (including threats to withdraw support) to compel reorganization of Congo
                        Government in order to try to win broader African acceptance, as political
                        basis for mercenary military operation.</p>

                        With all the muscle you can put into it, you should press upon them
                        necessity of maintaining government control where it now exists and
                        particular necessity of preventing rebels from capturing Kamina (which
                        covers approaches to Elisabethville) as well as Bukavu and Luluabourg. To
                        this end you should urge them to use resources immediately available, such
                        as getting into operational units Belgian officers whom they now have in
                        Congo serving as military advisors and using available technicians for this

                    <p>You should make clear to them our belief that government should be as

                    <p>2273 (In 44709). 1. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] and
                        [former <gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] had long meeting with
                            [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] afternoon 5 Aug and
                        exchanged views on current situation. Intel and ops info obtained cabled
                        earlier messages.<note n="2" xml:id="d202fn2">Not further
                        identified.</note></p>
                    <p>2. Later in evening [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>]
                        phoned requesting immediate meeting. As [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] occupied other duties, [former <gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] covered meeting. In addition [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>], [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 3</persName>] also present. Both men <pb n="290" facs="0323" xml:id="pg_290"/>greatly worried by developments, particularly by fall
                            <gloss target="#t_STAN_1">Stan</gloss>. They believe rebel capture this
                        city, combined with rapid rebel progress in Kivu, Kasai and Katanga, will
                        give rebel movement great psychological lift. Both expressed view that
                        disorders will break out in <gloss target="#t_LEOP_1">Leop</gloss> within
                        one week. They believe bandwagon psychology will encourage rebel supporters
                        already in native city <gloss target="#t_LEOP_1">Leop</gloss> to try all the
                        harder arouse popular disorders and that rebels may not even have to attack
                        city. Comment: Difficult judge whether they being too pessimistic, but view
                        fact it normal Congolese practice for people jump on bandwagon and view
                        general dissatisfaction masses over unemployment, high cost living, lack
                        political maturity people, etc, they may well be correct. If trouble does
                        not come quite as soon as they expect, Station would nonetheless expect
                        disorders within few weeks unless <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>
                        successful in arresting progress of rebels.</p>
                    <p>3. Both men appeared believe <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> has
                        some secret plan to resolve Congo rebellion. They commented they could not
                        believe <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> which has expended great
                        sums and wagered its prestige on support moderates would sit back and permit
                        men who would be hostile <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> and
                        probably under Commie influence to take over. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 3</persName>] who obviously trying plant idea, then suggested
                        following might be <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> policy:</p>
                    <p>A. Make secret deal with [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 4</persName>]
                        whereby latter would agree oust [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            5</persName>] in return for <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss>
                        military intervention. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 3</persName>]
                        noted that, as [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 5</persName>]
                        reconciliation policy has failed, [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            4</persName>] would have good reason to dump [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 5</persName>]. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 3</persName>] suggested [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            4</persName>] should then be encouraged to appoint member [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] group as temporary Prime
                        Minister, specifically mentioning [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            2</persName>] as best possible candidate.</p>
                    <p>B. Once steps outlined sub-para 3A accomplished, [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 3</persName>] suggested new govt would
                        immediately arrest [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 5</persName>] to
                        insure he could not return to home province to launch new secessionist
                        movement.</p>
                    <p>C. <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> military intervention would
                        take place concurrently with nomination [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 5</persName>] replacement. Thus new govt would have
                        opportunity crack down on all extremists (right or left) while <gloss target="#t_PBPRIME_1">PBPRIME</gloss> troops settling rebellion.</p>
                    <p>4. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] and [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 3</persName>] obviously suggested para 3
                        plan because they desperately grasping at straws and in typical Congolese
                        fashion seeking place burden responsibility on shoulders of others. [former
                            <gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] scoffed at idea, noting he aware
                            [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 3</persName>] effort plant idea.
                        [former <gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] pointed out following
                        weaknesses para 3 plan:</p>
                    <p>A. <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> does not look with favor on
                        idea intervening militarily in Congo rebellion.</p>
                    <p>B. Such intervention would be most obvious to entire world.</p>
                    <pb n="291" facs="0324" xml:id="pg_291"/>
                    <p>C. Dumping [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 5</persName>] might result
                        in yet additional political infighting that would only serve assist
                        rebels.</p>
                    <p>D. [former <gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] not at all sure new govt
                        would be able prevent escape [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            5</persName>] or other key leaders from his home area.</p>
                    <p>E. Such coup d’etat could be used as pretext by many persons to withdraw
                        support from central govt.</p>
                    <p>F. Suggestion no more than outright coup d’etat with local trappings, and
                        would alienate many countries. Such action would particularly upset Belgians
                        and thus might preclude Belgian intervention. [former <gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] added that, after African solution,
                        direct Belgian intervention appeared offer good alternative. Took advantage
                        this statement to again run over <gloss target="#t_ODACID_1">ODACID</gloss>
                        policy guidances as [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>] had
                        requested be done.</p>
                    <p>5. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] and [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 3</persName>] appeared accept this advice.
                        Both recognized problems involved <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss>
                        direct intervention. They also recognized advantages African involvement but
                        flatly stated would much prefer Belgian troops. However, they came around to
                        idea African troops might be used police non-combat areas.</p>
                    <p>6. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] and [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 3</persName>] volunteered view that <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss> with exception first paracommando
                        battalion should be disarmed, if Belgian troops intervened in Congo. Thus
                        they recognized need get rid of current rabble and replace with
                        newly-trained and hopefully disciplined army. This does not mean they favor
                        removing [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] from his army
                        job.</p>
                    <p>7. [former <gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] and [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] decided it advisable not pass
                        above report to [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>]. <gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss> only: [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not
                            declassified</hi>] down on him and <gloss target="#t_LEOP_1">Leop</gloss> fears [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>]
                        might in some way reveal his knowledge [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] and [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            3</persName>] had toyed with ideas reported para 3 above. In any case,
                        believe they have put this idea aside, at least for immediate future.
                        [former <gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] and [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] will endeavor regularly
                        monitor their feelings this subject. Believe we will obtain advance warning
                        if they return to para 3 ideas.</p>

                        difficulties obtaining mercenaries.</p>
                    <p>Propose you explore following general plan with <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName>:</p>
                    <p>1. U.S. and Belgium give commitment in principle to creation of mercenary
                        officered gendarmerie force, as only alternative to continued disintegration
                        of security situation, with tentative force level of four thousand gendarmes
                        and two hundred white officers. We recognize and are prepared to share
                        political responsibility this course with <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>2. Immediate objective is at earliest possible time to provide equipment and
                        funds to establish pilot group of about 500 men to meet most urgent security
                        needs in next several weeks.</p>
                    <p>3. Belgian and American Ambassadors with experts in <gloss target="#t_Leo_1">Leo</gloss> should develop detailed plan for creation, organization,
                        and use of force and equipment with immediate priority on mounting 500 man
                        force.</p>
                    <p>4. Points you should particularly explore with <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName>:</p>

                        not as critical as we think. Also he tried to minimize adverse effect to
                        Belgian business of rebel takeover. After I expressed our judgment that
                        rebels would in time be dominated by ChiComs, he modified his position and
                        discussed a step-by-step program (details septel).<note n="2" xml:id="d204fn2">Telegram 200 from Brussels, August 8, transmitted the

                    <p>Belgians request us to add six additional T–28s or armed T–6s. I agreed we
                        would consider promptly. We expected to contribute needed motor
                        vehicles.</p>

                    <p>C. While maintaining his refusal to have Belgian officers encadred in <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>, we [<hi rend="italic">he</hi>?] did agree
                        to authorize Belgian advisors to go to Bukavu and critical forward points,
                        and agreed desirability of Congo request for French officers for encadrement
                        of gendarmerie.</p>
                    <p>D. He agreed instruct his Ambassador to discuss with <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>

                        initiative.</p>
                    <p>E. We discussed at some length possible necessity of Western peace-keeping
                        forces in which the Belgians would participate. While initially <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> was reticent he finally offered to
                        talk to British, German, French and Italian Ambassadors over the weekend or
                        latest on Monday stressing gravity of situation, importance of preserving
                        Congo to protect interests of all in Africa and possibility of requirement
                        of some form of Western participation. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> assumed that we would also participate. I took no
                        commitment but indicated that our contribution, if any, could better be in
                        an air support unit. On <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName>’s
                        insistence I agreed that we would have similar talks with above Ambassadors
                        in Washington early next week.</p>
                    <p>Thus at the end we appeared to be in full agreement on matters that should be
                        given urgent consideration.</p>

                        assistance from Belgium. He expected us to support this position.</p>

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BMG_1">Bundy</persName>: The other one you need to know
                        about is in the Congo where there’s shakiness today in Leopoldville. We’ve
                        had a rather panicky request from the Ambassador to authorize a flyover of
                        jets from the aircraft carrier <hi rend="italic">Enterprise</hi> to try to
                        scare off rebels. We are not disposed to authorize that and would prefer not
                        to have any U.S. military hand showing there at all and we’ll go back to him
                        in that sense unless, against all my expectations, you want to have another
                        aircraft carrier in action in another continent this weekend.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: No.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BMG_1">Bundy</persName>: Finally we’ve got to go

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: Why does he think—</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BMG_1">Bundy</persName>: Well, he thinks a show of
                        force may strengthen <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s hand
                        but that seems to us the least desirable show of force. We’re going to have
                        a couple of cargo planes fly in there landing things and get out some black
                        propaganda about how strong he is, and wait for <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> to get back here tomorrow morning and then go on
                        with the plan that he and <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> have
                        put together which, if we have time enough, makes pretty good sense.</p>

                        than general idea of what he would like to have, and did not have benefit of
                        careful thought on organization or use). As a result your consultation we
                        would also like to get a clearer picture of what matériel requirements could
                        be met out of stocks in the Congo, and what new equipment would be
                        needed.</p>
                    <p>4. In preparation for discussions, Embassy will want to consider following
                        matters:</p>
                    <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Chain of Command</hi></p>
                    <p>Should new force be: (a) connected to the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> or existing gendarmes; (b) separately assigned to control
                        of Defense Committee; or (c) under control of Minister of Interior.</p>
                    <p>While we want to avoid problem with <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, believe it important he not be able to control or
                        frustrate this force. (<persName corresp="#p_DLA_1">Devlin</persName> may
                        have <pb n="298" facs="0331" xml:id="pg_298"/>some ideas on how he can be
                        kept happy because we want to avoid his active opposition.)</p>
                    <p>It seems to us also that new force should not be attached directly to
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> for the simple reason
                        that he already has too much to do and would not be in position to make
                        decisions even if he were readily accessible. <persName corresp="#p_MGO_1">Munongo</persName> therefore would seem logical candidate, as Minister
                        of Interior. However, Embassy should consider other alternatives.</p>
                    <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Organization of the Force</hi></p>
                    <p>Unit organization of new force will depend in large measure on the
                        operational concepts under which it will operate and the resources readily
                        available. In developing first component (para 2) as well as follow-on
                        units, consideration should be given to “attack unit” composed entirely of
                        military technicians to form cutting edge. In addition to combat units,
                        consideration should be given to development of logistical support system,
                        manned by Belgian or military technicians. Thought should also be given to
                        development of logistical base (possibly Kamina).</p>
                    <p>C. <hi rend="italic">Concept of Operations</hi></p>
                    <p>Consideration should be given to:</p>
                    <p>(a) How units would be organized and used to capture rebel strong points;</p>
                    <p>(b) How strong points, when captured, will be held; and</p>
                    <p>(c) How new force would work with <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> and
                        forces from other African countries. Consideration should also be given to
                        follow-up measures to be taken in areas freed from rebel control. From
                        experience in Baudoinville, building materials in addition to consumer goods
                        and such things as medicines should be brought into the area immediately,
                        with special attention paid to tribal chiefs to obtain their loyalty to
                        central government.</p>
                    <p>4. Aside from para 2 program would appreciate soonest country team’s views on
                        foregoing together with whatever other substantive matters it considers
                        would be helpful to raise with Belgians and Congolese.<note n="3" xml:id="d207fn3">In telegram 450 from Leopoldville, August 10, <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> reported that he discussed

                    <p>2343 (In 47324). [<persName corresp="#p_MJA_1">McCone</persName>], [<persName corresp="#p_HRI_1">Helms</persName>] and [<persName corresp="#p_FGD_1">Fields</persName>] from [former <gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>]
                        and [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>].</p>
                    <p>1. In past few days security and military situation has deteriorated
                        seriously. Rebel capture Stan has given rebels and persons favoring their
                        cause great psychological fillip. This extremely important asset for the
                        rebels, more important than an additional BN, for the bandwagon effect plays
                        even greater role in Congolese politics than in more sophisticated nations.
                        Also, fall of Stan when added to considerable rebel successes Kivu, Maniema,
                        some areas Katanga and Kasai and fact many other areas appear open to
                        subversion has depressed <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> leaders and
                        supporters. Although spirits of leaders fluctuate, a sense of pessimism and
                        defeatism prevails. It stems from recent rebel successes and fact most
                        leaders realize <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> is a weak reed, if
                        indeed not a broken reed, on which to rest the internal security of the
                        Congo.</p>
                    <p>2. As reported previously, rebel activists already working in <gloss target="#t_Leo_1">Leo</gloss>, and presumably in other areas not under
                        rebel control, endeavoring to exploit rebel successes by fanning flames of
                        discontent of people and army (based on high unemployment rate,
                        dissatisfaction with incompetent and venal leaders, tribal enmities, etc)
                        and to weaken their will to fight. <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                        expects these agitators, some of whom have been trained abroad, to step up
                        their activities and to resort to violent tactics. In 60 Gizenga, <persName corresp="#p_MPI_1">Mulele</persName> and some others who now <gloss target="#t_CNL_1">CNL</gloss> leaders did not hesitate to try
                        assassinate opponents; thus such tactics are again expected. Should this
                        come to pass, and should even three or four key <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> leaders be assassinated, it could result in rebel victory,
                        for there are only a few leaders available with capacity and courage to
                        oppose rebel objectives.</p>
                    <p>3. Leaders such as <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Nendaka</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, Kithima, <persName corresp="#p_BJE_1">Bolikango</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NAL_1">Ndele</persName>
                        have stated at one time or another in last few days that they expect
                        security situation continue deteriorate. Specifically, <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Nendaka</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName>, both of whom have been fairly reliable interpretors
                        of the feelings of the people and who have proved their personal courage
                        many times in past few years, fear <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> will
                        collapse under rebel pressure, take easy way out by joining rebels and that
                            <gloss target="#t_Leo_1">Leo</gloss> will fall from within through
                        subversion and internal disorder. (Interestingly <pb n="300" facs="0333" xml:id="pg_300"/> enough <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Nendaka</persName>
                        has sent his family to Europe for “school registration” and <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> plans do same with his family.
                        Also <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> has requested [US
                        Embassy] to pass message to his family in Rome that he hopes to join them 15
                        Aug.)</p>
                    <p>4. The <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> is in poor shape. Only a few
                        units have had the courage of capacity to oppose effectively the rebels.
                        Main problems of the army are lack of leadership, discipline, knowhow and
                        motivation. This point driven home to [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            1</persName>] and other [US Embassy] personnel in Lisala and Bumba
                        during aborted attempt rescue Stan [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            2</persName>] personnel. They found state of <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> morale precarious and rebel fever beginning seize the area.
                        Troops were restive, surly and near rebellion. Lisala troops appeared
                        dominated by some noncoms and purposeful agitators. Also presence of about
                        three hundred soldiers at Bumba who escaped from Stan creates potentially
                        explosive situation. The virus could easily spread to the limited number of
                            <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> troops remaining in the western
                        Congo and set stage for a domino-like collapse of the army similar to that
                        which occurred in 60. Seriousness of situation can be recognized when one
                        realizes that only troops in Equateur and Leopoldville provinces which now
                        stand immediately between rebel forces in Stan and those in <gloss target="#t_Leo_1">Leo</gloss> are the fourth gendarmerie BN (whose
                        contingents in Lisala do not instill confidence), one company at Bolobo and
                        disorganized remnants of the Stan garrison. While other organized troops
                        might be flown in, such step would weaken <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> positions other areas.</p>
                    <p>5. One alternative which being suggested from all sides is encadrement of
                            <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> with mercenaries or officers on
                        loan. However, this assumes that morale of troops is such that they willing
                        and able fight under proper leadership. Many here doubt time exists for
                        imported officers raise troop morale and reinstill discipline and will to
                        fight. One possibility to which some <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                        leaders cling is use of Katangan gendarmes (Katgens). Many Katgens
                        available, and if sufficient arms and other supplies could be provided along
                        with proper encadrement, they might be able save the situation. Recognize
                        many believe this would be most palatable solution of various alternatives
                        explored recently. However we and local <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> military doubt Katgens offer rapid short term solution.
                        View fact many of Katgens have been demobilized since Dec 62, they would
                        probably need considerable training before they could be whipped into shape
                        and unfortunate fact that during Katanga secession they did not prove better
                        than average <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> troops (believe
                        mercenaries responsible for majority Katgen victories), cannot help wonder
                        whether this solution can be achieved fast enough and whether it offers a
                        sufficient margin of security, one on which <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> is prepared consciously to base its Congo (and perhaps
                        African) policy.</p>
                    <p>6. During 8 Aug meeting Cols <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName>
                        (Chief <gloss target="#t_COMISH_1">COMISH</gloss>) and <persName corresp="#p_DWA_1">Dodds</persName> expressed their personal views that
                        the introduction of additional <pb n="301" facs="0334" xml:id="pg_301"/>
                        mercenaries does not offer a sufficiently sure margin of security. Also they
                        doubt additional hardware would, alone, do the job, for if the Congo is to
                        remain a national entity the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> must
                        regain and occupy the vast territories over which it has lost control. These
                        officers concluded that, to obtain a sufficient margin of safety to permit
                        the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> to encadre troops, either Katgens
                        or <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>, it would be necessary to station at
                        least one non-African battalion in <gloss target="#t_Leo_1">Leo</gloss>.
                        They specifically mentioned non-African troops, for they doubted African
                        troops would be prepared intervene directly, in local security problems.
                        Station not qualified militarily to pass judgement on these views, but on
                        the basis of intel available, it shares view that intervention of foreign
                        troops probably would be required to insure <gloss target="#t_Leo_1">Leo</gloss> held long enough to train and encadre units needed to
                        defeat rebels and occupy lost areas. These views shared by many Station
                        contacts (Kithima, <persName corresp="#p_BJE_1">Bolikango</persName> and
                            <gloss target="#t_CDA_1">CDA</gloss> executive committee). <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Nendaka</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> specifically favor foreign intervention, for they
                        look upon it as only way of disarming rebels, <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>, of securing some semblance of peace in the country and of
                        providing a respite during which <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> could
                        create and train an entirely new army. They convinced this step will be
                        necessary, for even if by a miracle the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>
                        resolved the current rebellion, peace and order cannot be guaranteed in the
                        Congo until current rabble which passes for an army is reorganized and
                        retrained.</p>
                    <p>7. One problem of awaiting the encadrement of Katgens is that, per above, it
                        will take time and thus might allow Commies or extremist African states time
                        to recognize rebels. Thus, such military policy could conceivably allow
                        outside powers who oppose <gloss target="#t_Leo_1">Leo</gloss> govt to
                        supply arms and/or “volunteers” to rebels.</p>
                    <p>8. Should use of mercenaries and Katgens fail turn tide, foresee Commie field
                        day in the Congo. Although doubt more than a few rebel leaders motivated by
                        Commie ideas and thus trained agents of influence, most rebel leaders have
                        come under some degree of Commie influence. If Commies worked fast enough,
                        they might be able to exploit rebel govt for Commie ends, just as Bloc tried
                        do immediately after independence in July and Aug 60. However, unless Commie
                        civil and military technicians were able to move in behind the rebels,
                        suspect rebel victory would in very short time result in struggle for power
                        between various leaders, factions and tribal groups now closely allied under
                            <gloss target="#t_CNL_1">CNL</gloss> flag. While an outstanding leader
                        might come to fore and build a monolithic state, one which at very best
                        would be less than friendly and at worst would be actively hostile to <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> interests, believe chances much
                        greater that chaos and anarchy would be the result. Together with many other
                        local observers, suspect Congo would gradually splinter under pressures of
                        personal ambition and tribal rivalries into numerous semi-autonomous states,
                        some of which might <pb n="302" facs="0335" xml:id="pg_302"/>obtain actual
                        or defacto independence. One such state might be Katanga, but to retain its
                        independence, it would probably have to align itself with South Africa,
                        Southern Rhodesia and Portugal. Obviously, such a state would provide
                        Commies, not to mention more extremist African states, with a ready-made
                        opportunity for intervention. Similarly, many of the states which might
                        develop would not be viable and thus would make easy targets for subversion.
                        In short, Congo would become the sick man of Africa. Commie toe holds in
                        petty Congo states would provide bases for subversion ops into many east,
                        central and west African countries, most if not all of which are ripe for
                        subversion.</p>
                    <p>9. If neither <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> nor other Western
                        states prepared send troops to Congo, believe <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> must face the other alternative, i.e., the almost
                        certain collapse of the central govt and establishment of a regime
                        controlled by rebels. Recognize Belgians believe it possible come to terms
                        with rebels but per above we consider this fallacious thinking. Although
                        recognize few, if any, rebels actual Communists, continue believe their
                        control of govt would open the way to Communist penetration of Congo and
                        possibly undermine <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss>’s African
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>10. While recognize <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss> is not and
                        should not become involved policy decisions, we have prepared this cable to
                        provide <gloss target="#t_HQS_1">HQS</gloss> with Station appreciation of
                        the intelligence factors. Also recognize some of this message based on
                        speculation. However, this speculation represents a consensus of many local
                        observers, including such Station contacts as <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Nendaka</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName>,

                        us to submit these views through <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss>
                        channels to assist <gloss target="#t_HQS_1">HQS</gloss> in interpreting the

                    <p>11. Discussed above informally with [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>] who states he finds “nothing with which to quarrel”
                        in the preceding message. He specifically requested this message be passed

                    <p>What is very unclear is how deep the Chinese hand is in the rebel efforts.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> thinks it is pretty
                        deep; most of the intelligence community thinks it is more marginal.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BWH_1">Brubeck</persName> raises hard questions at the
                        end of his memorandum, and I think that the dominant judgment at the moment
                        is that we ought not go beyond the steps currently in train, and that
                        particularly we should not now plan on sending a Special Forces of U.S.
                        forces—that could not only come if a lot of other people were willing to
                        act, which is not currently the case. The CINC Strike C–130 force is another
                        matter because of its relation to a possible need for evacuation of
                        Americans.</p>

                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> reported on his
                        talk with <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> in Brussels and on
                        agreements reached there regarding support for gendarmerie and mercenary
                        forces and additional US military assistance. <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> felt that these steps while useful would probably
                        not meet fully the military need, and expressed concern with <gloss target="#t_Chicom_1">Chicom</gloss> involvement. He said the Congolese
                        army in most cases has proved useless, that the people in the government are
                        demoralized and Leopoldville in danger.</p>
                    <p>With regard to possible US-European forces, he said the Europeans are
                        unlikely to participate without US involvement but thought the US role could
                        be limited to an air contribution. He will talk to the Western European
                        Ambassadors in Washington along these lines.</p>
                    <p>The President asked what countries and how much force are being
                        considered.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> said France, Great Britain,
                        Germany, the Netherlands, Italy and Canada with a maximum of 3,000 men for
                        garrison duty only. Actual combat operations would be left to Congolese army
                        and gendarmes but they would require white officers. Although the Belgians
                        have talked of the possibility of “doing business” with the rebels <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> believes he convinced <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> that this is a myth.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_MJA_1">McCone</persName> endorsed <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName>’s stress on the <gloss target="#t_Chicom_1">Chicom</gloss> role and expressed similar
                        skepticism about doing business with the rebels. Although <pb n="306" facs="0339" xml:id="pg_306"/> he thought the military problem is
                        quantitatively small, he was pessimistic about the Congolese military
                        capacity and thought Western troops would be necessary.</p>
                    <p>In response to a <persName corresp="#p_BMG_1">Bundy</persName> question
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> said that if Nigerians
                        or other Africans will provide troops, European intervention is avoidable.
                        Without African help, European help might be needed within two weeks.
                        Immediate US efforts should be concentrated on air support and pressure for
                        African assistance to the Congo. <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> help is
                        unlikely because the Russians would veto Security Council action and a
                        General Assembly at this time is undesirable.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> said that while the present
                        trouble is tribal unrest and rebel bands moving freely in the absence of
                        effective police, we must assume that if disintegration continues the
                        Communists will take over. The job can be done on a small scale if done now,
                        and it should be put squarely to the Europeans as their responsibility. We
                        should urge them immediately to put troops into Leopoldville, using
                        Presidential pressure if necessary.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> reported on the military
                        situation and status of US air-craft being supplied. McNamara expressed his
                        strong agreement with <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> and
                        suggested that, if the Europeans fail to accept responsibility, we should
                        not continue to carry the burden alone in the Congo.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed doubt as to whether such a choice is open to us, and
                        said we may have to continue our role regardless of what others do. However,
                        he added, this may be the point at which to make a basic issue with the
                        Europeans of their accepting a share of responsibility in situations such as
                        the Congo.</p>
                    <p>McNamara indicated his belief that we should be prepared to increase our
                        military assistance to Ethiopia and Nigeria perhaps as much as $10 million,
                        if this would help them in providing military support to the Congo.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_DCD_1">Dillon</persName> expressed the view that direct
                        American involvement in the Congo should be considered only as extreme last
                        resort. General <persName corresp="#p_WEG_1">Wheeler</persName> concurred in
                        this as “the long held view of the <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss>.”</p>
                    <p>The President said emphatically that we all share this view. He said that
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> has authority to make
                        strong representations to the Europeans for help and should ask <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> to make similar approaches. The
                        President asked for a report by Friday, August 14 on our success in getting
                        European or African military help for the Congo.<note n="2" xml:id="d211fn2">See <ref target="#d220">Document 220</ref>.</note></p>
                    <pb n="307" facs="0340" xml:id="pg_307"/>
                    <p>The President also authorized financial and logistic support to any African
                        countries in meeting the expense of any such help; and air transport
                        assistance for moving European troops.</p>
                    <p>The President observed that time is running out and the Congo must be saved.
                        When these steps have been tried, he said, we will look at the situation
                        again to consider what further decisions may be required.</p>

                    <p>249. From the Secretary. I am convinced that requests to Governments from
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> for African troops constitutes key
                        to present Congo impasse. Without such requests from <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>, problem of trying assist Congo becomes
                        much more complicated. It is essential US exert every pressure now to this
                        end.</p>
                    <p>You are therefore instructed to request an immediate audience with <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to get them to despatch today requests to other
                        African countries, particularly Ethiopia and Sudan. In this connection might
                        be useful to have ready draft text of letter of request. In case of
                        Nigerians letter should be follow up to earlier request. Indicate US will
                        support strongly <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> efforts. For obvious
                        reasons <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> should figure
                        prominently in request to other African governments. Should also follow up
                        if possible with expressions of support from <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> et
                        cetera (perhaps as special ambassadors).</p>
                    <p>You should inform <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> that it is
                        essential to our cooperation that he put his cards on table and explain his
                        political objectives, tactics and problems. I believe you should also tell
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> that more evidence of realism and
                        cooperation must be forthcoming from them if our collaboration is to be
                        fruitful.</p>
                    <p>You should also tell ambassadors of countries receiving requests that US
                        prepared provide necessary airlift and support costs above normal salary,
                        allowances and maintenance.</p>
                    <p>To maximize chance of African help terms of request should be limited and
                        precise, e.g. that mission is to garrison and secure two or three key
                        cities, not to act as assault troops.</p>
                    <p>US and Belgian efforts will be frustrated unless you persuade <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> soonest to act with energy in area of African
                        assistance and create image of Congolese Government representative of
                        Congolese people struggling to maintain unity and independence in face of
                        great difficulties and external attempts at subversion.</p>

                    <p>On August 11, 1964, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>
                        reported that the Embassy had received a commercial telegram in French from
                        Consul Michael <persName corresp="#p_HMP_1">Hoyt</persName> in Stanleyville
                        stating that Lieutenant General <persName corresp="#p_ONI_1">Nicholas
                            Olenga</persName>, Commander-in-Chief of the Popular Liberation Army,
                        had told him that because they had seen U.S. troops in action against the
                        Popular Army, the Consulate had to be evacuated. Despite <persName corresp="#p_HMP_1">Hoyt</persName>’s denial that any U.S. troops were
                        engaged in operations against <persName corresp="#p_ONI_1">Olenga</persName>’s army, the General ordered that all the personnel of the
                        Consulate be evacuated by the first available plane. <persName corresp="#p_HMP_1">Hoyt</persName> asked for instructions. The
                        Ambassador sent a reply asking <persName corresp="#p_HMP_1">Hoyt</persName>
                        to inform <persName corresp="#p_ONI_1">Olenga</persName> that he had been
                        misinformed, but nonetheless authorizing <persName corresp="#p_HMP_1">Hoyt</persName> and other U.S. personnel to depart on the first
                        available aircraft. <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> asked
                            <persName corresp="#p_HMP_1">Hoyt</persName> to tell <persName corresp="#p_ONI_1">Olenga</persName> that U.N. Representative <persName corresp="#p_OBF_1">Osorio-Tafall</persName> was willing to send aircraft
                        carrying <gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss> doctors and medicine, which
                        could evacuate the Consulate personnel to Leopoldville, but he must have the
                        General’s assurance that its landing and subsequent departure would be
                        permitted and that the safety of the doctors and crew would be assured.

                    <p>On August 12, <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> informed
                        Washington that the Embassy had received a message in French from <persName corresp="#p_ONI_1">Olenga</persName> via public telex, warning that if
                        military or technical aid were furnished to the <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> government, he would consider himself obliged, with

                        of those countries providing aid. (Telegram 471 from Leopoldville; ibid.)
                        The Ambassador reported that he responded to the <persName corresp="#p_ONI_1">Olenga</persName>’s message via public telex, warning
                        the General that the U.S. Government would hold him personally responsible
                        for the security of every American in the Stanleyville region. (Telegram 480

                    <p>Relying on <gloss target="#t_Deptel_1">Deptel</gloss> 223 to <gloss target="#t_Leo_1">Leo</gloss><note n="3" xml:id="d215fn3"><ref target="#d207">Document 207</ref>.</note> I then said <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> had decided, as requested by <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> support development of 3,000 man gendarme
                        force to be led by military technicians, with US providing vehicles,
                        communications and air support as needed and Belgians providing other arms
                        and other kinds of equipment.</p>
                    <p>2. In line with this I added four C–130 aircraft would arrive tomorrow in
                        order provide lift capacity urgently requested by <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>. These aircraft would be accompanied, in addition to their
                        crews, by group of soldiers for maintenance and protection of these
                        aircraft. Total number of such soldiers would be about 100 men.</p>
                    <p>3. I said that Governor <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName>
                        would be arriving aboard one of these planes in order discuss with him and
                        PriMin problems of restoring security in Congo and how US might help.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> said he would look
                        forward to seeing Governor <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName>.</p>
                    <p>4. I then paraphrased for Chief of State first three paragraphs of <gloss target="#t_Deptel_1">Deptel</gloss> 249. At point where I emphasized it
                        essential that if <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> are to cooperate they must put all cards
                        on table. I distressed to say that Department informed by South African
                        Ambassador in Washington yesterday (<gloss target="#t_Deptel_1">Deptel</gloss> 244)<note n="4" xml:id="d215fn4">Dated August 11.

                        two squadrons fighter aircraft ready for action plus officers and enlisted
                        men and various equipment, all within 48 hours. When I pointedly asked
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> whether he knew about
                        request for <gloss target="#t_SA_1">SA</gloss> military assistance he gave
                        me distinct impression this first he had heard program, although he was
                        somewhat evasive in answering.</p>
                    <pb n="311" facs="0344" xml:id="pg_311"/>
                    <p>5. I once again bore down with <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> on importance US attaches to African participation
                        in process of restoring order in Congo and said we ready provide necessary
                        aircraft and support costs above normal salary, allowances and maintenance
                        for African troops which might come here. I did not discuss penultimate
                        paragraph of <gloss target="#t_Deptel_1">Deptel</gloss> 249 re missions
                        which African troops might have, nor did I point up though that Belgian, as
                        well as our own efforts might be frustrated unless African assistance
                        forthcoming. However, I did return once again to theme that more evidence of
                        realism and cooperation must definitely be forthcoming from Congolese
                        side.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> then said what I had just
                        told him obviously important since it represented views of highest <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> circles. He added he could give me no
                        answer until he had had chance to discuss this whole question of African
                        assistance with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. Only then
                        could he give US and Belgians, whom he implied had made parallel démarche,
                        re importance of African participation, <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>’s considered reply. I tried in several ways draw him out
                        further in order get his own views on subject, but to no avail. He ended
                        audience by saying he hoped have good talk with Governor <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName>, whom he hoped would be able stay
                        longer in Congo than during last visit.</p>
                    <p>7. Upon return to office I found message from <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> asking me to call at 1600 local time.<note n="5" xml:id="d215fn5">In telegram 481 from Leopoldville, August 12, <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> reported his discussion of this

                            based on his conviction that the Congolese people would react violently
                            against their government if they learned of such requests.

                    <p>1)We informing UNNY on strictly confidential basis Nigerians have agreed to
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>’s request to provide

                        blessing.</p>
                    <p>2)We consider immediate follow-through of critical importance in saving Congo
                        from anarchy. Continued deterioration in security situation with further
                        rebel gains and consequent disintegration of morale throughout country could
                        lead to fragmentation of Congo within matter of weeks if immediate and
                        drastic remedial action not taken.</p>

                        made following points:</p>
                    <p>A. Doubts Congo can be preserved as one national entity. With few competent
                        troops could retake any point now held by rebels. But what is the use if
                        Congo does not have qualified cadre to move in behind army and establish
                        civil administration.</p>
                    <pb n="314" facs="0347" xml:id="pg_314"/>
                    <p>B. View above only solution is to create a Congo based on limited number
                        loosely federated provinces or independent states, perhaps along lines
                        previous provinces in Belgian Congo. Perhaps, and only perhaps, Congolese
                        qualified administer such units. In reality, good administration not
                        possible without European cadre. If such cadre not available and area
                        liberated, Congolese troops will merely start looting, stealing, etc once
                        again and situation which we know now will start all over again.</p>
                    <p>C. Katgens no better than <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>, unless led by
                        European officers, except for fact they have not been exposed to anarchy of
                        Leop.</p>
                    <p>D. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] returning [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>], 14 Aug. Will
                        return only if he believes there chance for viable solution. Regrets <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> did not go along with Katanga
                        experiment. On leaving [former <gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>], he

                    <p>4. Heartily concur we need numerous contacts in [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] camp, but this strongly opposed by [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>] and his deputy. (<gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss> only: They reluctant have Leop move in
                        direction [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>]. Basically,
                        they do not like or trust him, and prefer not make move in his direction
                        unless this solicited by him. Secondly, believe they hope keep <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss> tied to [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym

                    <p>5. [former <gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] has not seen [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] again because [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>] did not want additional <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss> contacts: Leop does not concur, but
                        had been going along with this. Thus, basis ref, will begin 12 Aug trying
                        build up such contacts. Believe this can be done in most cases without
                        arousing ire [US. Embassy]. Only cases which would cause too much trouble
                        would be [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] and minister

                    <p rend="center">CONGO</p>
                    <p>1. Problem: How to restore order and some semblance of stability in the Congo
                        (Leopoldville).</p>
                    <p>2. Situation: The so-called rebel forces of the <gloss target="#t_CNL_1">CNL</gloss> in the Congo have extended their control in a very brief
                        period from Uvira on the Burundi border to Albertville on Lake Tanganyika
                        west to Kabalo and up the Lualaba River and rail line to Stanleyville, the
                        center of Lumumbist dissidence in the Congo. They have done this through the
                        relatively simple tactic of exploiting whatever discontent there may be in
                        each area by the use of advance agitation agents followed by a relatively
                        small but active armed force. The rebel forces are currently in effective
                        control of Stanleyville and are planning to move on momentarily further west
                        to Coquilhatville. Their successes have been loudly broadcast by
                        Stanleyville Radio and their indominability is becoming accepted by both
                        Congolese and Europeans alike. A general attitude of defeatism has set in
                        not only in the towns in their path but even in Leopoldville. As of this
                        date the key city of Bukavu on Lake Kivu in the east is seriously threatened
                        but has not yet fallen. In viewing the extraordinary progress made by the
                        dissident forces it becomes ever more apparent that they are receiving both
                        monetary and advisory support from outside and that there are evidences of
                        the Chinese Communist trademark.</p>
                    <pb n="317" facs="0350" xml:id="pg_317"/>
                    <p>3. Faced with the above situation and the continued disintegration of Central
                        Government control in the Congo as well as the approaching evaporation of
                        the Central Government itself, the Embassy in Leopoldville is anticipating
                        in the near future the possible fall from within of Leopoldville itself.
                        There has been some speculation among informed Congolese leaders that it
                        could come as early as 15 August 1964. With this in mind the Embassy has
                        urgently recommended the immediate dispatch of non-African troops to
                        guarantee the security of Leopoldville and the port area at the mouth of the
                        Congo River. With this area secured, planning could then proceed for the
                        reacquisition by various means of the territory already in rebel hands.
                        There is a growing feeling that even <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s 8–900 paracommandos cannot or will not hold even
                        Leopoldville. Without first securing this critical area as a base from which
                        to operate, it will be more difficult to carry out a realistic plan for
                        reclaiming the rest of the Congo in the immediate future.</p>
                    <p>4. Therefore, in simplest terms, the alternatives seem clear and are in
                        descending order or desirability:</p>
                    <p>A. Dispatch of at least one battalion of Belgian paracommandos to secure and
                        garrison Leopoldville and the port area. These troops would be on the ground
                        for the stated, and not too implausible, purpose of protecting what is left
                        of the Congo from outside invasion. There is precedent for this in Congo
                        (Brazzaville) where a French garrison is still located. Further, there is
                        precedent for dispatch of metropole troops at the request of the government
                        of a former colony, i.e., Tanganyika.</p>
                    <p>B. A second alternative is obtaining French willingness to provide troops for
                        this purpose.</p>
                    <p>C. A third and probably unacceptable option is the dispatch of a U.S.
                        force.</p>
                    <p>5. In order to obtain the military intervention of any foreign power the
                        Congo Government must first make such a request and clearly on a most urgent
                        basis. The three operative elements in the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> today are <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Joseph
                            Kasavubu</persName>, as President, Defense Minister and
                        Commander-in-Chief of the Congolese National Army (<gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss>), Moise <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>,
                        the Prime Minister, who claims the support of at least 4,000 ex-Katangan
                        gendarmes (Katgens), and General <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Joseph
                            Mobutu</persName>, the Commander of the <gloss target="#t_CNA_1">CNA</gloss>. Unless these three leaders work together there is little
                        prospect of accomplishing even the first step in a plan to reclaim the
                        Congo, i.e., securing full Belgian assistance. Thus, it is imperative that
                        the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>, presumably through its ambassador,
                        establish a close and confidential relationship with all three of these
                        leaders. To date this is not the case, but it must be developed without
                        delay if we are to be able to provide the necessary assistance. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, being the most active of the
                        three, is perhaps the key element and must be prepared to keep our
                        Ambassador <pb n="318" facs="0351" xml:id="pg_318"/> intimately informed in
                        strictest confidence of his day to day plans and problems.</p>
                    <p>6. Assuming that the U.S. immediate objective in the Congo is as stated above
                        to take all possible action to restore order in the Congo and establish some
                        semblance of stability in the country after returning the disaffected areas
                        to Central Government control, the following actions can be and in some
                        areas are being undertaken by <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>:</p>
                    <p>A. Military Action:</p>
                    <p>(1) Air:</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> is presently providing air support to
                        the Congo Government. At present this support includes furnishing [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] pilots and ground
                        personnel for six T–28’s provided by <gloss target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss>
                        and six T–6 aircraft [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>]. There are at this moment four of six T–28’s flying.
                        One is undergoing repairs, one is being replaced and is expected to be in
                        operation within 14 days. The six T–6’s are in flying condition but are
                        currently in the process of being armed. Six additional T–28’s provided by
                            <gloss target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss> have been promised for the Congo
                        and all are expected to be combat operational within 31 days. Seven B–26
                        aircraft from <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> contingency force [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] have been ordered
                        to the Congo. The first two of these are to depart for the Congo within two
                        days and will arrive within one week. These planes will be ferried to
                        Leopoldville by U.S. contract personnel with <gloss target="#t_USAF_1">USAF</gloss> markings with stops at Takhli, Ganis, and Aden. The [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] operational pilots
                        and ground personnel will be provided by <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> ostensibly under contract with the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>. Experienced B–26 pilots are already on the ground. More

                        T–6 are considered necessary to provide greater flexibility of movement in
                        the Congo where many alternate airfields are now in rebel hands. The
                        remaining aircraft will arrive in the Congo within 2–3 weeks.</p>

                        to have a minimum number of ground U.S. contract technicians where no [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] are available. In
                        addition, there will be a total of at least three U.S. contract or staff
                        officers [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]. The
                        total number of personnel in this program will reach a total of

                    <p>(2) Ground:</p>
                    <p>Since it has now been graphically displayed that the Congolese Army is
                        totally ineffective and unreliable without leadership and it is <pb n="319" facs="0352" xml:id="pg_319"/>clear that the army does not have qualified
                        officers to lead the troops, it is apparent that only with Belgian or other
                        white officers can an effective striking force be put in the field. Thus the
                        Belgian Government has been requested by State to assist and has agreed to
                        provide Belgian officers to lead these troops. Fifty such officers have or
                        are being dispatched to the Congo for this purpose. In addition the French
                        Government has been requested similar assistance. However, to date the
                        French have not been forthcoming with direct support. Nigerian troops have
                        also been requested for garrison duty but the response to this request has
                        not yet been received. It is further understood that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> has asked the Government of the
                        Central African Republic (<gloss target="#t_CAR_1">CAR</gloss>) to provide
                        troop units. The army of the <gloss target="#t_CAR_1">CAR</gloss> is largely
                        officered by former French Foreign Legionnaires. As of this date it is not
                        known whether an agreement has been signed. At the same time <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> has made efforts to obtain the
                        services of white mercenaries from South Africa and Southern Rhodesia.
                        According to <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Michel Struelens</persName>,
                        Belgian Publicist for <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, there
                        are 100 such mercenaries ready to go. It is believed, however, that
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> is unable to pay their
                        salaries and has accordingly asked for financial assistance in this matter
                        from both the Belgian and U.S. Governments. In the interest of creating at
                        the earliest possible time an effective strike force it has been agreed that
                        the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> will support the immediate
                        development of a 3000 man force with 200 white mercenaries. In order to
                        avoid official <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> involvement with these
                        mercenaries (Military Technicians) <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> has
                        been called upon to [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines not declassified</hi>]
                        determine what <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> needs to
                        establish a force with the least possible delay and to offer to help finance
                        the salaries of these Military Technicians if payment is causing the delay.

                    <p>The Government of Nigeria has informed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> that it would be willing to make a battalion

                        troop question to become a Nigerian election issue unless he is sure of
                        African support. Despite our efforts, the Congolese Government has not so
                        far asked any other African country for military forces save South Africa
                        which fortunately refused. Governor <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName> is now in the Congo to press as a matter of highest

                        military technicians (mercenaries) to stiffen <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> and Gendarme units. Col. <persName corresp="#p_VCF_1">Van

                        the fact that on even a short-term basis much more is at stake than
                        Stanleyville, or Leopoldville, or any amount of real estate in the Congo.
                        There is a real danger that in saving the present situation in the Congo we
                        can suffer psychological and other setbacks that could lose us the longer

                        financial interests.” <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi> already has
                        had one such story and Communist, and some African, propagandists have
                        seized upon this theme.</p>
                    <p>This Agency and I are for taking whatever immediate steps are necessary to
                        halt the deteriorating situation in the Congo, but we are <pb n="323" facs="0356" xml:id="pg_323"/>convinced that long lasting damage to
                        United States interests throughout Africa will result from our becoming
                        closely identified with any operation involving the aforementioned
                        mercenaries. I think it is unreasonable to assume that the label
                        “technicians” will conceal the fact that the hired soldiers are
                        mercenaries.</p>
                    <p>I call to your attention the enclosed report<note n="2" xml:id="d221fn2">Attached but not printed.</note> which spells out propaganda themes
                        being pushed by the Communists with regard to the Congo; the propaganda
                        activities of the Congolese rebels, and reactions in other African countries
                        to United States and other Western activities.</p>
                    <p>It is our view that the Communist campaign in itself is not as significant as
                        the fact that it is being picked up in other African countries (and is
                        certain to be fed by the debate that began today in the Congress and in the
                        American press).</p>
                    <p>I believe that there are some things that we can do to make our actions in
                        the Congo more palatable internationally and to make ourselves less
                        vulnerable to Communist propaganda. I recommend that:</p>
                    <p>1. We seek publicly to justify our activities in the Congo as assistance
                        given in response to requests by President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>.</p>
                    <p>2. We do not overpublicize on our initiative relatively small actions that we
                        are taking. I do not advocate hiding facts from the American public, but I
                        do not believe we are obligated to make a press announcement every time an
                        American official confers with Belgian officials; and I believe we can send
                        in transport planes without creating a barrage of press stories that make it
                        appear that we are invading the Congo.</p>
                    <p>3. If it is possible, we not permit to become public United States activities
                        in transporting arms to the Congo for use by white mercenaries.</p>
                    <p>4. We avoid, if at all possible, having South African and Southern Rhodesian
                        mercenaries fly United States aircraft in operations against the rebels.</p>

                    <p>1. We are disturbed by press here publishing statements today attributed to
                        Leopoldville to effect that US paratroopers will ride “shot gun” on the H–34
                        helicopters and that these aircraft may be used to support the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>. Fact that helicopters included in
                        equipment being sent Congo had not up to that point been made public. There
                        is no present thought here of expanding mission of plane guards beyond that
                        established in <gloss target="#t_CINCSTRIKE_1">CINCSTRIKE</gloss> order
                        covering deployment of four C–130’s to Congo.</p>
                    <p>2. Press and public opinion suspicious and restive that US is undertaking
                        “creeping” commitment in Congo where every move enlarges area US
                        responsibility and draws US closer into expanding role, comparable to that
                        in Vietnam, in Congo military and security situation.</p>
                    <p>3. We wish to make it perfectly clear that the military personnel which
                        accompanied the C–130s are for the sole purpose of providing ground security
                        for C–130s deployed to the Congo. They are not intended to provide security
                        or to accompany helicopters in any mission which the helicopters might
                        attempt. Departures from foregoing such as to provide guards for helicopter
                        mission contemplated in which the security of helicopters is in doubt will
                        not be flown without <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> approval on a case
                        by case basis.</p>
                    <p>4. We recognize that Leopoldville is small village and that able aggressive
                        press corps there capable of finding out most US moves. However Embassy and
                        country team should avoid premature disclosure of US moves and contingency
                        plans.</p>
                    <p>5. Embassy and country team should particularly avoid any comments on what
                        other governments particularly Belgium and African countries are, or may be,
                        planning to do.</p>

                    <p>This is a covert action project designed to reduce the insurgency and restore
                        some semblance of order and stability to the Congo (Leopoldville).</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">B.</hi> Objectives:</p>
                    <p>The objective of this project is to help stem the tide of the rebel advance
                        by two basic covert actions:</p>
                    <p>A. To assist in reinforcing and re-establishing tribal allegiances in
                        critical areas, by judicious contributions of covert funds, and</p>
                    <p>B. To assist in financing mercenaries in cases where hard currency is not
                        otherwise available.</p>
                    <p>Tribal allegiances are of critical importance in stabilizing the Congo under
                        present disrupted conditions. This project will attempt to obtain assurances
                        from local chiefs that they will resist encroachment by <gloss target="#t_CNL_1">CNL</gloss> agitators as well as attacks by armed
                        bands. Acting through political leaders with known tribal bases, certain
                        monetary contributions to achieve this end will be made. Advice will be
                        provided for reinforcing the will of tribes to resist the spread of
                        insurgency, and efforts made to insure that covert funds are effectively
                        spent. In providing support of this nature to tribal leaders other than
                        Moise <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, the Prime Minister,
                        action may generally but not necessarily be coordinated with him.</p>
                    <p>In assisting in the financing of mercenaries, where hard currencies are
                        otherwise not available, it is the basic intent of the project to keep to a
                        minimum the number of South African or Rhodesian mercenaries assisted
                        through this mechanism; it is also accepted that some funds might be used
                        for assisting the Belgian technicians directly concerned with the
                        re-establishment of order in the Congo.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">C.</hi> Background:</p>
                    <p>The so-called rebel forces of the <gloss target="#t_CNL_1">CNL</gloss> in the
                        Congo have extended their control in a very brief period from Uvira on the
                        Burundi border, and in Kwilu to a large part of the eastern Congo, including
                        Stanleyville. They have done this through the relatively simple tactic of
                        exploiting whatever discontent there may be in each area by the use of
                        advance agitation agents followed by a relatively small but active armed
                        force. Rebel successes have been loudly broadcast by Stanleyville Radio and
                        their invincibility is becoming accepted by both Congolese and Europeans
                        alike. A general attitude of defeatism has set in not only in the towns in
                        their path but even in Leopoldville. As of this date the key city of Bukavu
                        on Lake Kivu in the east is seriously threatened but so far has stood off
                        concerted attacks. In viewing the extraordinary progress made by the
                        dissident forces it is apparent that they are receiving both monetary and
                        advisory support from Chinese Communist, Ghanaian, Burundi and, tacitly,
                        from Congolese (Brazzaville) sources.</p>

                        opportunity to speak a few words with him alone. I opened the conversation
                        by referring to the point he had made at the beginning of the long
                        conference of the necessity of establishing a firm basis of confidence
                        between us. I said that the President of the United States was most
                        concerned with the grave situation in the Congo and that he wanted to
                        support the efforts of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and his government to maintain the unity of the
                        Congo and the prosperity of its people. I then made reference to the fact
                        that he had during the larger conference called attention to the doubts
                        expressed by some of his associates and the attitude of some of the country
                        team toward the <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> government.
                        I said that it was the President’s policy to support the present government
                        of the Congo and that it consequently was the policy of all of us.</p>
                    <p>I pointed out that in the memorandum which he had given me the day before he
                        had raised certain doubts as to the attitude of the Ambassador toward him. I
                        said that for that reason I was sure he would understand that in all
                        friendship I could not accept the memorandum. I said, of course, that if he
                        had any reason not to want Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> to represent the United States he had only to say
                        that, and that the matter would be taken care of forthwith. (During the
                        general meeting I had already explained the policy of the United States with
                        respect to our maintaining contact with members of the opposition as well as
                        with the Government, and that this was an obligation of the Ambassador. I
                        had already in the same meeting indicated that the President and I had full
                        confidence in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>.) Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> brushed the idea of his
                        being concerned about the attitude of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> completely aside. He said when he
                        had spoken in the general meeting that the abscess <pb n="328" facs="0361" xml:id="pg_328"/>was drawn, that the whole matter was closed, and that
                        he intended to move ahead with complete mutual confidence.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> indicated that he was
                        glad that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> had
                        spoken so firmly and directly in response to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s bringing up the question of
                        doubts about people in the country team. He said it was very useful for him
                        to have had <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> speak in this
                        fashion before certain of his colleagues who were in the larger meeting. He
                        indicated that he had had some questions raised by them and that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>’s forthright statement
                        would help him foreclose these questions. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> treated the whole <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> matter in an extremely friendly and
                        understanding manner and showed not the slightest indication of concern or
                        displeasure. In fact, he was smiling and extremely cordial and friendly
                        throughout the entire interview. As we rose to leave, he picked up the
                        memorandum and, I believe, put it in his pocket.</p>
                    <p>During the talk we had alone, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> also raised the matter of communicating with other
                        African countries for help. He said that after our meeting of the day before
                        he had prepared letters to a number of other African countries asking for
                        help. He mentioned particularly <persName corresp="#p_TPH_1">Tsiranana</persName> of Madagascar. He indicated his sympathy with the
                        necessity for Africanization but pointed out that he had certain
                        difficulties with this among his associates, particularly General <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>.</p>
                    <p>On the matter of Africanization, I pointed out to the Prime Minister the
                        great importance of this to the President, both as a matter of international
                        politics and also of domestic politics, in as much as there were some in our
                        country who felt strongly that the United States should not take the lead in
                        trying to solve what might appear to some as a purely African situation. It
                        was important that other Africans be engaged as well.</p>
                    <p>In discussing the request for direct intervention of American combat
                        personnel. I emphasized to the Prime Minister that this was an exceedingly
                        difficult problem for the President because it involved global and domestic
                        policy considerations. I pointed out that the President had authorized me to
                        go a long way in working out matériel and training assistance so as to help
                        prosecute the war effort against the rebels. I said that the President was
                        really as interested as was the Prime Minister himself.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister confided that he was in a somewhat difficult position with
                        some of his colleagues because they tended to chide him on not getting as
                        much American aid as another leader might or as his predecessor had. He said
                        that he felt a particular duty to his country to prove that he could get as
                        much American aid as anyone else. I told him that the best proof of
                        America’s desire to be of help to him and his ability to get aid from the
                        Americans was the fact that we had immediately <pb n="329" facs="0362" xml:id="pg_329"/> volunteered to continue all aid programs and that we
                        had then gone ahead and provided even further aid.</p>
                    <p>I said that I hoped the discussions between General <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and his experts and our American
                        military experts would be successful in nailing down what the Congo needed
                        in the way of matériel, transportation, and training, because I was sure
                        that he would find that we would go a long way to be of assistance to him,
                        and that this in turn would further satisfy those who questioned his
                        relationships with us.</p>
                    <p>Let me say again, that throughout the entire conversation, Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> was exceedingly cordial
                        and, in fact, he spent a great deal of his time trying to ingratiate
                        himself. He went through his whole history of American missionary training,
                        the fact that most of his colleagues had American training or associations,
                        and, indeed, he said, the Belgians frequently reproached them as being too
                        pro-American. In short, he appeared to be as eager as I was to establish a
                        good working relationship, and he constantly reiterated his complete
                        confidence in our cooperativeness and reaffirmed his desire of
                        cooperation.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>There are several somewhat favorable developments that have improved the
                        security situation of the Congo and the morale in Leopoldville:</p>
                    <p>1)The arrival of four C–130’s and 3 helicopters with a platoon of U.S.
                        airborne infantry; the imminent arrival of five B–26’s for long-range
                        reconnaissance and strafing to strengthen Congolese army limited air
                        capability; the presence of Governor <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName> as indicative of high level U.S. interest.</p>
                    <p>2)The development of a military program by Belgian Colonel <persName corresp="#p_VCF_1">Van der Walle</persName> (now before <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> for approval) (a) for introduction
                        of 50 additional Belgian officers to assist in direction of military action
                        and additional Belgian military personnel for logistic support and (b) the
                        reactivation <pb n="331" facs="0364" xml:id="pg_331"/> of Katanga gendarmes,
                        with European military technicians, to be integrated into and to strengthen
                        the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>. With these additional forces, it
                        is expected that an offensive to recover areas lost to rebels can be
                        initiated in about six weeks.</p>
                    <p>3)The Military position has improved.</p>
                    <p>(a) Bukavu has held out due to tenacious defense by <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>. (In this, Col. Dodd’s presence has played a key role.)
                        Local Kabare Bashi and Ngweshi Nyaugezi tribesmen have remained loyal and
                        have taken an active part in the fighting. This appears to be a dividend of
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s recent visit. Two
                        T–28’s have broken up rebel advances.</p>
                    <p>(b) The recapture of Baudoinville. The city was found to be in a shambles by
                        looting. <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> with our assistance has sent
                        substantial quantities of civilian emergency supplies.</p>
                    <p>(c) The recapture of a number of other points in northern Katanga by a column
                        moving up from military base Kamina.</p>
                    <p>4)Governor <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName> has established
                        better communication with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        and other Congolese leaders. At long last the government has appealed for
                        African troops from the governments of Liberia, Senegal, Malagasy and
                        Ethiopia, in addition to an earlier request to Nigeria. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> has also written the Secretary
                        General of the United Nations requesting he use his personal influence with
                        Burundi and Congo (Brazzaville) to bring these countries “to cease action
                        seriously injurious to the population of my country.” He has also written to
                        the Secretary General of the Organization for United Africa requesting
                        African solidarity and support. These steps should be helpful in achieving
                        our objective of Africanizing the Congo’s problems, but <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s unpopularity with African
                        leaders may still cause difficulties. Although Ethiopia and Nigeria are the
                        only ones of these countries which could send as much as a battalion, the
                        other countries might send token forces or in other ways support the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> in its efforts to withstand rebel
                        uprisings. Our missions in the above-mentioned countries have been
                        instructed to support <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s
                        requests.</p>
                    <p>5)The Belgian businessmen are reconsidering their plan for evacuation of
                        dependents.</p>
                    <p>It should be recognized, however, that the situation, although less critical,
                        is still fragile and might rapidly deteriorate again by adverse development
                        such as the assassination of one of the key political personalities or the
                        fall of additional significant cities. The <persName corresp="#p_MPI_1">Mulele</persName> rebels in Kwilu are active again, threatening the
                        provincial capital Kikwit. The situation in Luluabourg is tense due to rebel
                        activity in the immediate neighborhood.</p>
                    <p>The report of arrival of three Ilyushin planes in Stanleyville is disturbing
                        but it has not yet been confirmed. They may be Ghanaian rather than
                        Soviet.</p>

                            Stanleyville and other important rebel-held cities. This request was
                            bluntly turned down. This was probably an important factor in
                            influencing <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to take
                            subsequent steps to appeal to African countries for support, as well as

                    <p>Am reporting separately conversation I have just had with <persName corresp="#p_NAL_1">Ndele</persName>, Governor National Bank and Roux,
                        his technical advisor, concerning request they received this afternoon from

                        availability $4 million to pay 3 months salary and expenses for 1,000
                        mercenary officers and noncoms. <persName corresp="#p_NAL_1">Ndele</persName> also said <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Nendaka</persName> was seeking [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                            declassified</hi>] Belgian francs to assist Sûreté and he anticipates
                        further hard currency requests for 200 agents for Sûreté that he has been
                        informed are about to be recruited in Europe. (We believe these are Pomploma
                        graduates mentioned frequently by <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>.)</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_DLA_1">Devlin</persName> has just informed me of green
                        light having been given by Washington for 10 million Congo franc fund for
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> with no accounting or
                        indication where it may be used. <persName corresp="#p_MGO_1">Munongo</persName>, as Department already aware, seeking up to 35
                        million dollars create his own police force and I anticipate important
                        shopping list from <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Nendaka</persName> for
                        Sûreté.</p>
                    <p>Funds involved are, in my opinion, relatively small as compared to principle
                        of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] covert
                        financial support of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and his
                        current team. I cannot help but have feeling that our aid to current team
                        and its implication of our overall African policy must be given another hard
                        look. If I am wrong, would appreciate urgent instructions.</p>
                    <p>We could give all-out back stopping to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. This would, I believe, eventually involve US
                        personnel, for once we get on this slippery <pb n="333" facs="0366" xml:id="pg_333"/>slope, we are more and more captive of the recipient as
                        our political investment increases.</p>
                    <p>We may now be past point of no return due commitment aircraft of US origin,
                        but am not too pessimistic on this score as of this time. Believe, however,
                        that if <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> creates majority
                        white army to retake rebel-held territories and if he and <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> fail bring about effective
                        Africanization of situation, we may well soon find ourselves in all-out
                        support, alone or with Belgians, of minority regime being propped up by US
                        financed foreign military technicians, US financed secret police, again with
                        white encadrement, plus US matériel. This regime undoubtedly does not enjoy
                        wide African support and could well be target of any African states seeking
                        to attack us. With continued local brutal repression and attempts reconquest
                        of rebel areas which would be carried out under banner of anti-Communist
                        action, those rebels not now looking to East would soon turn their attention
                        in that direction. We thus in brief time, I am convinced, would find
                        ourselves aligned with Union of South Africa, Portugal and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> against most, if not all of this
                        vast continent.</p>
                    <p>Reiterate what I have already recommended [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                            not declassified</hi>], i.e., that we maintain current, overt, limited
                        support of this Government, but that we not go all out in covert support
                        until we more certain as to longevity and effectiveness <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> team. To hold back will (except in
                        limited area of mercenary support) not in my view, pose threat of hobbling
                        war effort against rebels.</p>
                    <p>I, personally, am convinced that any course we now take involves serious
                        risks but in weighing the risks, I believe that the establishment of a
                        covert all-out support <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> is
                        betting on weak reed and once again urge that we not go all out either in
                        overt or covert political support.</p>

                    <p>165. Please deliver following message from President to Emperor:</p>
                    <p>“Your Majesty:</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> has reported to me
                        your deep concern over events in the Congo.<note n="2" xml:id="d231fn2">Telegram 200 from Addis Ababa, August 18, reported that Emperor Haile
                            Selassie was considering taking the initiative in consulting with other
                            African states on how to assist the Congolese Government in restoring
                            order. (Ibid.)</note> We share that concern.</p>
                    <p>I was personally gratified to learn that Your Majesty was considering a
                        possible initiative in this problem. I believe that an initiative by <pb n="337" facs="0370" xml:id="pg_337"/>Your Majesty would be particularly
                        effective at this time. I recall the dramatic results of your most helpful
                        assistance in the Algerian-Moroccan crisis last fall. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> has, perhaps, already informed you
                        that we would consider most favorably any move which Your Majesty might feel
                        appropriate to strengthen the authority of the central government of the
                        Congo under President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and
                        to help establish peace and order under that government.</p>
                    <p>The events in the Congo are moving rapidly and posing a most serious problem
                        to President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and his
                        government. The sacking of Baudouinville by the rebels who destroyed
                        hundreds of dwellings and news of rebel entry into Bukavu highlight the
                        threat of anarchy in the Congo and increase the need for quick and effective
                        action.</p>
                    <p>The United States has, from the beginning, sought to preserve the unity of
                        the Congo under the central government. To this end, we joined with the
                        African nations, as Your Majesty well knows, in the massive effort of the
                        United Nations. The preservation of the unity of the Congo and the
                        restoration of peace and order remain our basic objectives. We have strongly
                        supported a solution within an African framework and the principal reliance
                        on African security forces. I can assure you that our own efforts in
                        response to requests for assistance from the Government of the Congo are
                        part of our continuing effort to support the unity of this important nation
                        and are designed only to undergird and supplement efforts in the same
                        direction by the nations of Africa.</p>
                    <p>I wish Your Majesty every success as you deal with this, as well as other,
                        critical problems in the great continent of Africa.</p>

                        Intelligence.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName>, Assistant Secretary of
                        State for African Affairs, based on his recent trip to Leopoldville.<note n="2" xml:id="d232fn2">Not attached.</note></p>
                    <p>3. The following are the highlights of the Special Group (<gloss target="#t_CI_1">CI</gloss>) meeting of 21 August:</p>
                    <p>A. There is an urgent need for an analysis of the extent and importance of
                        the Chinese Communist assistance to the Congo rebels. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA_1">McCone</persName> stated he could have a report on
                        this subject available by this afternoon.</p>
                    <p>B. One of the most important danger spots in the Congo is Leopoldville itself
                        where <gloss target="#t_CNL_1">CNL</gloss> rebels have been reported
                        planning terrorist activities.</p>
                    <p>C. <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> will make every effort to provide
                        maintenance for the aircraft being [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] through the hiring of non-military contract
                        personnel. If, however, <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> finds itself
                        unable to recruit adequately qualified maintenance personnel, it can call
                        upon the Department of Defense to provide military personnel, recognizing
                        that it is important to keep the total number of military personnel in
                        Leopoldville to a minimum. U.S. Air Force aircraft maintenance personnel now
                        in the Congo to service the three B–26K’s supplied by the Air Force may
                        remain as long as necessary to train non-military personnel.<note n="3" xml:id="d232fn3">On August 24, the 303 Committee approved a proposal to

                    <p>D. The lives of five American Consular Officials in Stanleyville are in
                        danger. Everything possible should be done to effect their release. <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> on a priority basis is currently exploring
                        the feasibility of a covert rescue operation. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> should respond strongly to the <pb n="339" facs="0372" xml:id="pg_339"/>most recent and threatening
                        communication from the rebel leader, “General” <persName corresp="#p_ONI_1">Olenga</persName>, in Stanleyville. E. U.S. approach to the Congo
                        should be:</p>
                    <p>(1) Advance the Africanization of the Congo problem by quiet diplomacy, but
                        not by publicity or public discussion. In other words, do not “Americanize
                        the Africanization.”</p>
                    <p>(2) To provide a “cutting edge” necessary for military victories, the U.S.
                        should encourage the use of a requisite number of mercenaries. But
                        ostensibly the Belgians should be kept out in front in this and other
                        military matters. The U.S. military contribution should be confined mainly
                        to air support.</p>

                    <p>418. Stan Consular Staff. There follow some suggestions which Emb should
                        explore and comment upon.</p>
                    <p>1. We need counter hostages. Can <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                        (perhaps <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Nendaka</persName>) put under
                        protective surveillance any relatives of rebel leaders such as <persName corresp="#p_ONI_1">Olenga</persName> (if he is still alive) <persName corresp="#p_SGE_1">Soumialot</persName>, or any others whom Emb believes
                        may be influential there. It might be possible grab some important rebel
                        leaders in <gloss target="#t_Leo_1">Leo</gloss> or Bukavu for this
                        purpose.</p>
                    <pb n="341" facs="0374" xml:id="pg_341"/>
                    <p>2. Explore with Yugoslav Mission <gloss target="#t_Leo_1">Leo</gloss> whether
                        it has any way of reaching rebels and would it be willing act as
                        intermediary for purpose extricating <persName corresp="#p_HMP_1">Hoyt</persName> and staff.</p>
                    <p>3. Indian and Greek missions may have connections with their respective
                        communities in Stan. There is no reason to believe that rebels are immune to
                        carrots that attract other Congolese. In this connection has Alhadeff any
                        ideas?</p>
                    <p>4. We have considered asking <persName corresp="#p_NKW_1">Nkrumah</persName>
                        to act as intermediary. This idea temporarily held in abeyance due 1)
                        possibility Quashie may be PNGed and 2) probability that he would try expand
                        his role from extrication of <persName corresp="#p_HMP_1">Hoyt</persName> to
                        full scale mediation between <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and
                        rebels.</p>

                            the Emperor that his proposal for a personal initiative regarding the
                            Congo had been a mistake and that nothing should be done outside the

                        important you stress following points in way you think most appropriate:</p>
                    <p>1. US fully supports initiative designed take current Congo problem to <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> forum in context of supporting authority
                        legitimate Govt.</p>
                    <p>2. We believe however <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> nations will wish
                        give most serious consideration procedures and objectives in considering
                        this problem.</p>
                    <p>3. Congo problem is essentially question of assisting a legitimate
                        constitutional government to maintain security and integrity of nation <pb n="342" facs="0375" xml:id="pg_342"/>in face of externally assisted
                        insurrection. Whatever may be African views of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> fact remains he is Prime Minister appointed by
                        recognized head of state, President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>.</p>
                    <p>4. At center of problem therefore is sovereign government diplomatically
                        recognized by all Africans, established under a constitution approved by
                        national referendum and seeking maintain order in anticipation future
                        national elections. Any effort put present Congo government “in dock” before
                            <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> would establish dangerous precedent
                        of passing external judgment on legally constituted government. (In this

                            principle that it had supported in the past: territorial integrity and
                            deterrence of outside subversive forces meddling in internal affairs.

                    <p>420. We have carefully considered matters raised in your tels 615 and
                            616.<note n="2" xml:id="d236fn2">Telegram 615 from Leopoldville, August

                                227</ref>.</note> We are in agreement with your analyses
                        particularly that we should not become so committed to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> personally that we become his
                        captive as our political and military investment in him increases. While he
                        is Prime Minister, he serves at least in theory at pleasure of <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> whose commitment to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> may not be complete and total. On
                        other hand as long as he is Prime Minister, it is important we support him
                        to extent necessary to achieve commonly held objectives.</p>
                    <p>Main thrust of our present efforts are to promote Africanization of problem.
                        But we are not prepared to give up such present and potential <pb n="343" facs="0376" xml:id="pg_343"/>assets as we have in the Congo to this end.
                        We recognize there is a certain ambivalence in our willingness to see
                        military technicians employed on contract by the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and our desire to try to insist that Africans themselves
                        come up with an African solution.</p>
                    <p>We therefore propose that in giving specific aid for military technicians it
                        should funnel through <persName corresp="#p_VCF_1">Van der Walle</persName>.
                        This will have advantage not only of better accounting for funds but will
                        also give us a higher level of security.</p>
                    <p>As for numbers of military technicians involved, we would be willing to
                        accept levels (50 to 100) Belgians (Logiest and <persName corresp="#p_VCF_1">Van der Walle</persName>) have been talking about. <persName corresp="#p_MGO_1">Munongo</persName>’s scheme involving a thousand
                        simply not practicable as numbers involved are too great to be effectively
                        controlled and their great presence would be not only a very severe drawback
                        in Africa but probably would be a burden if not a plague inside Congo. In
                        any event, it most important to get initial program started immediately.</p>
                    <p>We see no objection to continuing aid, even slight increase to <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Nendaka</persName> and Sûreté. We would be willing to
                        entertain reasonable projects involving use of Gombloma graduates but
                            <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Nendaka</persName> should realize that to
                        attempt immediately to double size of Sûreté would only involve him in
                        administrative messes.</p>
                    <p>Overtly, we should have no connection with “technicians” or mercenaries. This
                        must be responsibility of <gloss target="#t_GOCL_1">GOCL</gloss> and
                        Belgians.</p>

                        many moderates into the party as possible. [<hi rend="italic">text not

                    <p>1. Recent political events in the Congo, culminating in the formation of a

                        Project has operated have also been overtaken by events.</p>
                    <p>2. The members of the [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>]
                        group remain, however, important factors in Congolese political affairs. It
                        would be highly inadvisable entirely to cut them off, operationally or
                        financially, during this interim. Were we to do so we would be subject to a
                        charge of “fair weather” expediency and the re-establishment of close
                        relationship at a later date would be severely hampered.</p>
                    <p>3. When the new lines of political party formation and leadership have
                        substantially clarified and crystallized, the Division will draft a new, if
                        only interim, project outline. A more or less “permanent” type project
                        outline may have to await the outcome of the general elections scheduled for
                        early 1965.</p>

                        limited support to selected Congolese political figures on an individual

                        customary in the past, there will continue to be discussion with the
                        Ambassador prior to any substantive disbursement.</p>

                        exploitation of the politicians concerned and to preserve operational

                        assets again return to positions of concrete political power. Any <gloss target="#t_CA_1">CA</gloss> exploitation will be coordinated with the
                        Department of State and the Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>6. These interim relationships will be maintained until new policy guidances
                        have been provided by the Department of State in the light of the changed
                        terms of political reference, and <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> has
                        been able to redirect its operations in consonance with these guidances.</p>
                    <p>7. The objective of this project is quite separate from project [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] which is designed to cope
                        with the insurgency situation now engulfing much of the Congo. [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] is a short-range
                        counter-insurgency effort providing for support to tribal leaders to enable
                        them to strengthen their defense against the various active guerrilla
                        movements which are all being supported to some extent by the Chicoms. The
                            [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] project, on the
                        other hand, is intended to give <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss>
                        political capability at the national level. While no political action
                        program can be undertaken until the insurgency situation is settled, it is
                        considered very important to maintain access during this period to members
                        of the [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] group and other
                        former political leaders, per attachment, who may be expected to play
                        influential roles again when normal political life is resumed in
                        Leopoldville.</p>
                    <p>8.

                    <pb n="351" facs="0384" xml:id="pg_351"/>
                    <p>(1) In accordance <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> principles, action
                        should be based on acknowledgment of Congo sovereignty and designed protect
                        independence and territorial integrity its members.</p>
                    <p>(2) It is assumed <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> will not raise
                        question its own legitimacy. But if question raised privately or publicly it
                        should be prepared reply succinctly and matter-of-factly on constitutional
                        grounds. <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> should also be careful that no
                        conference document throws any doubt on its legitimacy.</p>
                    <p>(3) Resort to force by opposition elements to overthrow legitimate democratic
                            <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> cannot be condoned by other African
                        states which themselves may be faced with similar problem.</p>
                    <p>(4) <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> should reaffirm in positive,
                        forceful way its basic principle that interference in internal affairs in
                        one state by others is inadmissible. Although <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> must obviously be prepared make specific bill of
                        particulars against Congo (B) and Burundi, it appears best that this be
                        minimal in formal meetings if pre-conference and corridor diplomacy assures
                        adoption satisfactory resolution. In any case such indictment these two
                        countries should be done in factual, unemotional manner. Neither <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> nor <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> should engage in shouting match with Congo (B).

                        problem could be unduly delayed and seriously prejudiced if any other

                    <p>Any suggestion such hearings should be strongly resisted in advance and in

                        believe there may be minimum of mischief if such investigations are kept out
                        of hands of radicals, as was done e.g., re <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> investigation of Roberto and rival Angolan organizations in

                    <p>(8) Although it doubtful meeting could undertake it, most desirable action
                        which could emerge from meeting would be resolution on Tanganyika formula
                        provided it does not specifically place limit on numbers African troops or a

                        for such a resolution if climate appeared favorable to it. At same time,

                        assistance may be important to solution sought. Since forthcoming meeting

                        contingencies, which could be difficult and possibly dangerous, resolution
                        might cover all arrangements of African states (with other Africans and
                        non-Africans) for military assistance in support of objectives of present
                            <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> resolution. As emphasized urtel,

                        interest in developments.</p>
                    <p>(7) Perhaps biggest obstacle to favorable African attitude is presence of

                    </list>
                    <p>1. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have received the attached staff estimate of the
                        internal security situation in the Congo<note n="2" xml:id="d245fn2">Attached but not printed.</note> and consider that it provides an
                        effective basis for evaluation of policy alternatives. The estimate includes
                        a brief explanation of the situation, a list of possible broad military
                        courses of action, and conclusions. These are summarized for convenience on
                        the attached spread-sheet.</p>
                    <p>2. The courses of action range from one of “wait and see” to one of direct US
                        military intervention. It should be noted, however, that alternatives might
                        be selected in combination and that any one could be refined to show various
                        options. Furthermore, some of the alternatives have already been considered,
                        are being explored, or are in the process of implementation.</p>
                    <p>3. The Congo has little strategic value from a strictly military point of
                        view. However, in terms of communist strategy and tactics, the Congo has
                        great value from a political point of view. The course of events in the
                        Congo may threaten US objectives of insuring its pro-Western orientation,
                        preventing communist infiltration, and maintaining Congolese unity. The
                        Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that communist-inspired rebellion could lead
                        to the rapid spread of communist influence throughout Central Africa. They
                        recommend that the United States:</p>
                    <p>a. Provide necessary matériel and financial assistance leading to effective
                        operations by Congolese security forces. Such assistance should supplement
                        Belgian and other Western support, which must continue to be encouraged.</p>
                    <p>b. Continue to persuade the Belgians to increase and acceler-ate their
                        support leadership efforts and to assume responsibility for the effective
                        performance of Congolese security forces, including mercenaries.</p>
                    <p>c. Supplement Belgian support and leadership with limited numbers of US
                        advisory personnel to meet the immediate needs of the <pb n="356" facs="0389" xml:id="pg_356"/>Congolese security forces. Continuation of
                        US advisory support should be conditional upon satisfactory Congolese
                        performance.</p>
                    <p>d. Continue with the Belgians to solicit appropriate assistance from other
                        Western nations.</p>
                    <p>e. If Belgium does not assume responsibility for the effective performance of
                        Congolese security forces, encourage the concept of intervention by a
                        coalition of Western and African countries to establish internal security.
                        However, implementation of other possible courses of action should not await
                        the outcome of efforts to obtain African support.</p>
                    <p>f. Accelerate current psychological operations designed to condemn communist
                        aggression, demoralize the rebels, and strengthen the Government of the
                        Congo and the political positions of its pro-Western leaders. A public
                        statement to serve these purposes should be issued promptly by the President
                        or the Secretary of State; however, this statement should guard against
                        committing the United States to “certain victory” in the Congo.</p>
                    <p>g. Exert increased diplomatic pressure as appropriate to discourage any
                        political, financial, or matériel assistance to the rebels.</p>
                    <p>4. The foregoing courses of action may fail because of Belgian reluctance to
                        become deeply involved, because of divisive forces and incompetence within
                        the Congolese Government, and/or because of increased external assistance to
                        the rebels. Consequently, the United States could be faced with a hard
                        choice between a basic desire to avoid an increasing US involvement and the
                        need to pursue US objectives. In this regard, the Joint Chiefs of Staff have
                        concluded that:</p>
                    <p>a. Direct US military intervention with combat forces could suppress rebel
                        military operations, preserve the existence of the pro-Western Government,
                        and provide short-term protection of US objectives. However, this probably
                        would not insure the objective of Congolese unity, and communist
                        infiltration would continue to be a threat. Also, the US Government would be
                        vulnerable to severe international reactions. While US forces might be
                        quickly disengaged, there would be a risk of continuing involvement.</p>
                    <p>b. A substantial unilateral US support program, to include tactical advisors,
                        might be successful. While international reactions would be less severe,
                        greater risks would be encountered of “another Vietnam,” with the United
                        States inheriting a continuing, difficult responsibility for internal
                        Congolese security.</p>
                    <p>c. Any course of action, to be of lasting value, would require effective
                        diplomatic action to deny the Congo–Brazzaville and Burundi as safe-havens
                        for rebel forces and similar action to discourage other African countries
                        from supporting rebel forces.</p>
                    <pb n="357" facs="0390" xml:id="pg_357"/>
                    <p>d. A decision on extensive US involvement is not justified, pending
                        solidification of Belgian and Congolese plans and intentions and an
                        examination of these proposals for compatibility in the light of US
                        objectives. At the same time, it is apparent that an early decision should
                        be made concerning such US assistance as may be furnished, because delays
                        probably will result in strengthened rebel forces. If intervention becomes
                        necessary, it should be executed without hesitation and with adequate forces
                        to insure rapid success.</p>
                    <p>5. While military actions can assist in solving the immediate security
                        problems in the Congo, there is also the overriding concurrent requirement
                        for solutions to political problems within the Congolese Government if the
                        US objective of establishing a viable and unified Congo is to be permanently
                        realized.</p>
                    <p>6. In summary, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that the United States
                        intensify its diplomatic efforts to persuade Belgium to accept
                        responsibility for the effective performance of Congolese security forces
                        and, to the extent necessary to secure this, provide matériel and limited
                        numbers of advisory personnel. Such US assistance is justified in the face
                        of communist encroachment. Although reconsideration may be appropriate as
                        the situation evolves, the United States should avoid the commitment of US
                        combat forces.</p>

                        meeting was in lieu of my attendance at the regular Tuesday luncheon which
                        was to involve political matters and therefore my presence was not

                        included the operation of 41 combat and transport aircraft, supplying with

                            line not declassified</hi>] obtaining foreign ground crews [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines not declassified</hi>]. I explained that this was
                        the best means of reducing the “U.S. Presence in the Congo”, which was
                        desirable, and met the complaint of Senators <persName corresp="#p_RRB_1">Russell</persName> and Stennis. I pointed out to the President however
                        that some place along the line <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> would be
                        criticized and accused of operating contrary to U.S. policy and this could
                        not be avoided [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>].
                        Nevertheless it would help [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] to stabilize the Congo, if doing so is possible, and
                        it was better that <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> take the criticism
                        than have the U.S. Government criticized. The President agreed.</p>

                            The Ad Hoc Commission, headed by Kenyan Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KJO_1">Jomo Kenyatta</persName>, consisted of
                            representatives from Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, Guinea, Cameroun, Upper
                            Volta, Tunisia, the United Arab Republic, and Somalia. Its mission was
                            to restore peace in the Congo through helping it to normalize relations
                            with its neighbors and to restore national reconciliation.</note> and
                        concurs with us that it is <pb n="365" facs="0398" xml:id="pg_365"/>generally good, particularly since it confirms legitimacy of Leoville
                        govt. At same time he noted that it is rather “equivocal” on certain points,
                        notably “foreign intervention” and expulsion of mercenaries. While more
                        extreme African states such as Casablanca bloc will doubtless try to exploit
                        equivocal provisions re “no foreign intervention” to attack Belgian and US
                        military aid to <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>, he did not think we
                        had to worry very much about this because substantial majority of African
                        nations would recognize Congo right to receive bilateral assistance. <gloss target="#t_Re_1">Re</gloss> expulsion of mercenaries, he felt draft
                        language “as soon as possible” would be generally interpreted in sense that
                        this phrase has been interpreted in <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                        resolutions which has more meaning “as soon as feasible”. While he thought
                        composition of commission could have been more favorable his preliminary
                        thought is that moderates would have at least majority of one and that
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJO_1">Kenyatta</persName> would make reasonable
                        chairman.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> then went on to say key
                        question on which future evolution of Congo situation largely depends is
                        “what will <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> do next?” While
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> has certain good and
                        useful qualities he also has his faults and if he is not properly advised he
                        is apt to act impulsively and take steps which are damaging. Therefore
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> is thinking in first
                        instance of someone who might serve as <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s political advisor. In other words, <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> wants someone on political side who
                        can supply <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> with advice and
                        counsel that <persName corresp="#p_VCF_1">Van der Walle</persName> is
                        supplying to him on military side.</p>
                    <p>In strictest and most absolute secrecy <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> said he was thinking of detailing Rothschild to Congo
                        for period of about three months. He explained that when Rothschild arrived
                        in Addis the initial draft of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s speech was appalling but as result of Rothschild’s
                        work it had been substantially revised in helpful sense. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> apparently likes and respects
                        Rothschild and also knows he has <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName>’s full confidence. What <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> has in mind is, at <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s request, to send Rothschild on preliminary survey
                        trip to Congo (just as <persName corresp="#p_VCF_1">Van der Walle</persName>
                        was sent) following which Rothschild would return and report to <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> on political situation and
                        possibilities, and then if <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        desired his services he would be detailed for limited period, perhaps three
                        months.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName>’s second preoccupation is that
                        there be no “spectacular military adventures” undertaken in the immediate
                        future. He explained there is substantial amount of military consolidation
                        to be effected and <pb n="366" facs="0399" xml:id="pg_366"/>one must move
                        steadily rather than spectacularly if <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>

                        progress maintained. He then said he wished to say on personal but frank
                        basis in keeping with intimacy of our relations that he understood there are
                        some differences between Americans and Belgian military in Congo and that
                        certain American officers are pressing for a swift and spectacular operation
                        against Stanleyville (<gloss target="#t_Embtel_1">Embtel</gloss> 427).<note n="4" xml:id="d252fn4">Dated September 7. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1964–66, 23–9 THE

                        differences in tactics and strategy between Belgian and American military
                        would be resolved in Leoville in a constructive sense.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> concluded by saying that in
                        next few days he and his immediate advisors would be reviewing all aspects
                        of Congo problem and that he would wish to meet with me next Tuesday
                        morning, Sept 15, for full and frank exchange of views.</p>
                    <p>I expressed appreciation to <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> for
                        his speaking with such complete frankness about Congo picture including
                        possibility of Rothschild being sent there. I emphasized again, as I had at
                        beginning, that we looked to Belgium to take lead in Congo and that if
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> desires Rothschild’s
                        services, I thought it would be splendid to send him. I added we fully
                        agree, as Gov <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> had made
                        clear in his August meeting with <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName>,<note n="5" xml:id="d252fn5">See <ref target="#d204">Document 204</ref>.</note> that one of crying needs of Congo was
                        qualified advisors and Belgium was in best position to supply them. We had
                        great confidence in Rothschild who over past several years had collaborated
                        with us on a basis of complete frankness and friendship and we respected his
                        intelligence and integrity.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_DVE_1">Davignon</persName>, who was present, expressed
                        reservation about sending Rothschild to Leoville, saying it would in effect
                        mean establishing “two Ambassadors.” <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> brushed this aside saying that if Rothschild went
                        there he would go as an advisor to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and that this was not incompatible with the presence
                        of a separate Belgian <gloss target="#t_Amb_1">Amb</gloss> who could ride

                        the secessionist state of Katanga, returned to the Congo during the latter
                        part of June 1964, and at the invitation of <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Joseph Kasavubu</persName>, President of the Congo, (and ostensibly
                        with the agreement of General <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                        and <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Victor Nendaka</persName>, Chief of the
                        Sûreté Nationale) accepted the task of forming a Government of National
                        Reconciliation as a necessary preliminary step to a general pacification of
                        the Congo. (This took place just before the formal resignation of Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> on 30 June, when it
                        became necessary to appoint an interim caretaker government which would rule
                        the Congo until national elections could be organized.) (In accordance with
                        the provisions of the new constitution, which is now being submitted to a
                        referendum for ratification, elections are to be held not later than nine
                        months after acceptance of the constitution by the people on 1 August 1964.)
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> quickly presented to
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> a cabinet list made up
                        of, for the most part, relatively unknown individuals and was himself named
                        by <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> as Prime Minister.</p>
                    <p>During the period of maneuver and counter-maneuver by various individuals and
                        political groups leading up to the return of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and the developments immediately thereafter, General
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Victor Nendaka</persName> played a somewhat devious
                        game, the final element of which was that their support was withdrawn from
                            <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> and, it is assumed, at
                        least conditionally given to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. Both <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Nendaka</persName> have retained their
                        positions under <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, but there
                        is now a good deal of evidence that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> is strengthening his hand so as to be able
                        ultimately to wield more influence within the Congolese Army, and needless
                        to say, reduce the influence of General <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> therein. Large contingents of ex-Katangese gendarmes
                        are now coming out of hiding in the bush and from neighboring Angola.
                        Recently reports have verified the presence in the Congo of a number of
                        white mercenary officers who formerly commanded <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s gendarmes during <pb n="368" facs="0401" xml:id="pg_368"/>the secession of Katanga, and it is surmised that they
                        may be used to lead <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> troops into battle
                        against the various rebel bands now terrorizing large segments of the
                        country. (The uprisings have spread from Kwilu and Kivu provinces into North
                        Katanga, Maniema, and Lac Leopold II provinces and have met with very
                        ineffective resistance from the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>.) More
                        than ever <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> needs the support
                        of <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> (and particularly <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss> support in the form outlined in the
                        project objectives):</p>
                    <p>1. To shore up his authority in the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>2. To assure him sufficient strength to be able to successfully counter any
                        attempt to impose an extreme (whether of the right or left) political
                        solution on the Congo;</p>
                    <p>3. To maintain the loyalty of his troops in the face of direct attempts at
                        subversion designed to fragment the army’s leadership and destroy its morale
                        and confidence in its officers;</p>
                    <p>4. To carry out the necessary reorganization and training programs to make of
                        his army a reasonably effective fighting force capable of handling the grave
                        threat to civil order posed by the various rebel movements.</p>

                        and said he hoped the time was near when the C–130’s could be withdrawn and
                        with them, most of the U.S. military support force. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> estimated that withdrawal of the
                        C–130’s would result in a reduction of no more than 125 personnel, leaving
                        approximately <pb n="369" facs="0402" xml:id="pg_369"/> the same number for
                        other required tasks, including T–28 maintenance. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA_1">McCone</persName> indicated that two C–54’s and
                        several C–46’s were earmarked to satisfy the Congolese government lift
                        requirements and handling and maintenance would be supervised by a
                        Panamanian company which was recruiting in Europe; this would reduce the
                        American presence. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA_1">McCone</persName> added
                        that it was his impression that considering the prejudices against <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> in Addis Ababa, both self imposed
                        and otherwise, he had emerged relatively unscathed and with some degree of

                    <p>1. Reference is made to a memorandum by the Deputy Secretary of Defense,
                        dated 4 September 1964,<note n="2" xml:id="d255fn2">Attached but not
                            printed.</note> subject as above, requesting the views of the Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff as to appropriate US military courses of action which could
                        be pursued to rescue the 25 Americans presently held by the rebel forces in
                        Stanleyville, Republic of the Congo, and an evaluation of the probability of
                        securing the rescue of the individuals unharmed.</p>
                    <p>2. Basically, two courses of action are available:</p>
                    <p>a. The overt use of a joint task force in a parachute/air-landed assault
                        operation, utilizing multiple drop zones and supported by tactical air, to
                        seize and secure the Stanleyville airfield, rescue the US personnel, and
                        withdraw the entire force. Additional details are contained in the Annex
                        hereto.</p>
                    <p>b. The covert use of military forces to effect a clandestine night parachute
                        landing west of Stanleyville, infiltrate by rubber boat or foot to the US
                        Consulate and/or other known locations of US personnel, <pb n="370" facs="0403" xml:id="pg_370"/>overpower the guards, and move with the
                        rescued personnel to a prearranged exfiltration area for pickup by
                        helicopter or C–46 air commando aircraft.</p>
                    <p>3. Modifications to either course of action would be required dependent upon
                        the latest enemy intelligence, the location and surveillance/guarding of the
                        personnel to be rescued, US force availability, and the decision as to
                        whether all or only part of the US personnel were to be rescued.</p>
                    <p>4. Either an overt or covert operation has a reasonable chance of
                        successfully rescuing the personnel unharmed, providing:</p>
                    <p>a. The precise location of the personnel to be rescued can be determined
                        PRIOR to initiation of the operation.</p>
                    <p>b. The plan is NOT compromised and complete surprise is obtained.</p>
                    <p>c. The commander is authorized to use such force as is necessary to
                        accomplish the mission.</p>
                    <p>5. Both of the courses of action in paragraph 2, above, might prove to be
                        infeasible because locations of US personnel may not be known, because of
                        the opposition of the Belgian Government due to anticipated reprisals
                        against foreigners in the Stanleyville area, or because the element of
                        surprise may be lost. Accordingly a third course of action might be required
                        which would provide for the capture of Stanleyville and its control long
                        enough to transfer control to Congolese security forces and/or evacuate all
                        foreign personnel. This course of action would probably require additional
                        force.</p>
                    <p>6. From a military viewpoint, if a decision is made to employ US military
                        forces to rescue the US personnel in Stanleyville:</p>
                    <p>a. The covert operation offers the best chance of successfully rescuing the
                        US personnel unharmed.</p>
                    <p>b. The covert operation should be backed up by the pre-positioning of the
                        overt force for contingency employment, if required.</p>
                    <p>7. To preclude undue delay in implementation, if directed, immediate
                        authorization to initiate detailed planning and dispatch of covert planners
                        to the Congo is required.</p>
                    <p>8. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend:</p>
                    <p>a. The broad course of action, envisioning the initial effort being conducted
                        by covert means with the back-up overt force being pre-positioned and ready
                        for contingency employment if required, be selected as the appropriate
                        course of action, if US intervention is directed.</p>
                    <p>b. Authority be granted for the immediate dispatch of the covert planners to
                        the Congo, if detailed planning is desired.</p>
                    <p>c. Political coordination be accomplished with Government of Belgium

                        Belgian military personnel, if US intervention is directed.</p>
                    <p>d. The above views be transmitted to the Department of State substantially as
                        in the Appendix and Annex hereto.<note n="3" xml:id="d255fn3">Attached but

                    <p>There is now an <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Commission on the Congo
                        which is beginning to operate in Nairobi, Kenya, September 18. Meanwhile,
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> has gone home to resume
                        his war and he and rebels are both making intransigent noises.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> now has enough military power

                        Commission very likely wants to and can help produce a negotiated
                        settlement, and the Belgians are obviously taking this line. Neither we nor
                        Belgians can really control situation. However, if we work together, we can
                        provide an essential part of help needed to solve.</p>
                    <p>The decision making process in State is badly bogged down with <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> caught between <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName> (who wants to deal with <hi rend="italic">all</hi> Congo policy for long term now, including

                    <p>We need a fairly precise policy determination as to whether we are prepared

                        for two reasons: to lay down a clear line for all the cooks in this stew;

                    <p>664. As we see immediate problems which face us in light relatively
                        satisfactory outcome of <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> conference,
                        following are our immediate priority tasks:</p>
                    <p>1. To assure that <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and rest of <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> not only remain committed to resolution
                        but cooperate in implementing it in spirit <pb n="373" facs="0406" xml:id="pg_373"/>and as much in letter as negotiating history and
                        Congo’s internal security problems require;</p>
                    <p>2. To take rapid hard look at military and related activities with view
                        toward reducing US visibility and, if possible, changing forms of assistance
                        in ways which might lessen problems with ad hoc committee without incurring
                        unacceptable loss of military effectiveness; and</p>
                    <p>3. Coordinating diplomatic initiatives by US, Belgians and <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> in African capitals, particularly with
                        those members of ad hoc committee which we have reason to believe will be
                        understanding and helpful, with objective of assuring best possible
                        atmosphere for cooperation between commission and <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> on former’s arrival Leopoldville.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_Re_1">Re</gloss> (1), you should see <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and express to him our great
                        pleasure and admiration at effective manner in which he handled himself and
                        presented his country’s problems at Addis Ababa. You should add that in our
                        opinion he has made most heartening progress in establishing his credentials
                        as an African leader and in obtaining the understanding of many of his
                        African brethren of the hard problems which confront his government. You
                        should emphasize importance we attach, and which we are sure he shares, to
                        building on promising beginnings made at Addis Ababa toward obtaining vital
                        cooperation of rest of Africa in dealing with Congo problem. You may tell
                        him at same time that we aware of problems which some of provisions of
                        resolution may pose for him. Nevertheless, we believe resolution constitutes
                        signal victory for principles for which he sought recognition and important
                        thing now is to prepare for commission of inquiry in spirit of Addis Ababa.

                    <p>Although we believe it would be a mistake to give <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> what we regard as reasonable
                        interpretations of questionable parts of resolution you may wish keep
                        following in back your mind in case conversation should turn in that
                        direction.</p>
                    <p>1. Department does not consider that paragraphs 6 and 7 of resolution
                        prohibit <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> from concluding or continuing
                        bilateral arrangements to assure its own internal security. On same basis
                            <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> is not “at present intervening in
                        internal affairs Democratic Republic of Congo” since it assisting <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> at request legitimate government.</p>
                    <p>2. Although <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> committed to
                        expelling mercenaries, Department believes resolution phrase “as soon as
                        possible” and fact <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> did not provide
                        troops which he requested give him considerable flexibility in meeting this
                        commitment. Recognize he will be subject varying degrees of adverse
                        criticism.</p>
                    <pb n="374" facs="0407" xml:id="pg_374"/>
                    <p>3. Resolution acceptably recognizes previous <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> efforts bring about national reconciliation and does not
                        confer on commission powers to negotiate with rebels without <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> cooperation.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_Re_1">Re</gloss> (2), Department suggests following areas
                        should be explored:</p>
                    <p>(a) Embassy requested examine and suggest soonest any possible means in
                        addition those already taken to reduce visibility and change form US

                        connection is there anything US could or should do before visit <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> commission?</p>
                    <p>(b) Embassy should urge <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>,

                        all necessary actions taken to accept individual rebel surrenders and
                        deposit their arms; to prevent any brutal or retaliatory treatment against
                        captured and surrendering rebels; to suspend obvious or unnecessary
                        activities in Leopoldville and elsewhere which could be considered
                        intimidation opposition elements; to examine moves which could be made to
                        broaden government, at least partially.</p>
                    <p>(c) <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> should undertake all possible steps,
                        without weakening internal security, to reduce mercenaries visibility or
                        otherwise lessen the effect as political liabilities. For example, perhaps
                        repatriation undesirables can be represented as conscious decision reduce

                        shares views expressed by Emb <gloss target="#t_Leo_1">Leo</gloss> re
                        importance African leaders understanding true nature rebel leadership and
                        dissension within its ranks, we believe it most important that we guard
                        against creating impression that US undertaking campaign to discredit rebels
                        either for its own reasons or because we not confident African ability form
                        valid judgments their own.</p>
                    <p>Although we recognize that members <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Ad
                        Hoc Commission will indulge in much self-seeking and wishful thinking re
                        rebel leadership, we believe that more responsible members will be at pains
                        protect position <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and wish examine for
                        themselves true facts re rebel movement. In this connection Dept assumes
                        Bochley–Davidson press conference at Addis Ababa and widely publicized
                        recent statements by Gizenga, <persName corresp="#p_GCH_1">Gbenye</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_ONI_1">Olenga</persName>, et al
                        are already known to most African leaders. We believe these statements speak
                        for themselves without necessity for US drawing inferences therefrom for
                        benefit <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> members. In short, we believe
                        that rebel leaders themselves doing good job of discrediting themselves if
                        their statements are widely circulated and that US is in strongest posture
                        by staying in background and avoiding risk of being charged by radicals with
                        effort sabotage commission’s efforts at national reconciliation by seeking
                        discredit rebels.</p>
                    <p>We assume moreover that <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> will be making
                        clear to Commission in strongest terms its own appraisal of rebels. While
                            <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> assessments will undoubtedly be
                        suspect, particularly to radicals, we would hope that they would at least
                        underline importance of Commission visiting rebel areas and assessing
                        leadership on spot before becoming too deeply into national reconciliation.
                        Believe US and Congolese objectives will be most effectively served by
                        encouraging such visits to rebel areas.</p>

                    <p>The most significant development has been the receipt by the <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> representative in Bujumbura of a message
                        from the Stanleyville authorities saying that they accept the <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> proposal to send in a plane to
                        Stanleyville with doctors and medical supplies. We have assured the <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> of our full support, urging that a Swiss
                        plane and pilots be used for this purpose. The <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> is working on this matter on an urgent basis and it is
                        hoped that an <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> plane will be in a
                        nearby position, such as Bangui, by the middle of the week to go into

                    <p>Whether or not the plane will be allowed to evacuate people, particularly
                        Americans, remains to be seen. (There are indications that <persName corresp="#p_GCH_1">Gbenye</persName>’s acceptance of the plane is due to
                        his desire to use it for his own transport to Nairobi for the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Commission.) However, we <pb n="378" facs="0411" xml:id="pg_378"/>have our fingers crossed and the mission
                        should at least serve to ascertain their welfare and whereabouts.<note n="2" xml:id="d260fn2">On September 21, <persName corresp="#p_LMJ_1">Looram</persName> sent <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName> a memorandum pointing out that it would be

                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, in standing on position
                        that <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> should participate in any
                        conversations involving U.S. and <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>
                        commission <gloss target="#t_reps_1">reps</gloss>, we are counting on his
                        flexibility and cooperation. You should add that if formula we have proposed
                        should be acceptable to <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> commission, we
                        believe <gloss target="#t_Leo_1">Leo</gloss> would be most appropriate locus
                        of conversations and we would wish try steer things in that direction. This
                        would have advantages of talks taking place at seat of <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and, at same time, bringing commission to
                        Congo where we hope it might be persuaded more realistically to face up to
                        Congo realities than is presently case in rarified Nairobi atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>Regardless whether <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> commission accepts
                        our formula for conversations, we strongly believe <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s best tactic in any event is to
                        encourage commission come to Congo soonest. We concerned in this <pb n="380" facs="0413" xml:id="pg_380"/>connection at accumulating evidence that
                        commission moving beyond terms of reference laid down Addis Ababa. We
                        believe <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> can help reverse this trend by
                        following means:</p>
                    <p>(1) <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> should act immediately to send
                        emissaries to friendly African members commission (particularly Nigeria,
                        Upper Volta, Cameroons, Ethiopia, Tunisia and possibly Somalia and Guinea)
                        to express his concern and to urge those governments to instruct their
                        representatives to insist that the commission keep its activities within
                        purview <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> resolution.</p>
                    <p>(2) To take initiative himself in urging commission to come soonest to Congo
                        to appraise problems on spot and offer place plane at their disposal for
                        this purpose. Believe it important in this connection that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> make clear that he wants
                        commission to visit rebel held areas to assess for themselves nature these
                        regimes, degree of unity (and disunity) amongst rebel leaders and extent
                        their genuine political (as contrasted military) support amongst population.
                        In short, objective would be to encourage commission to undertake realistic
                        survey Congo problems on spot before becoming involved in unrealistic and
                        dangerous approaches to problem of national reconciliation.</p>
                    <p>You should assure <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> we will
                        assist in these efforts as well, but <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                        must take lead re (1) and only <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> can

                    <p>1020. For <persName corresp="#p_AWH_1">Attwood</persName> from the Secretary.
                            <gloss target="#t_Embtel_1">Embtel</gloss> 721.<note n="2" xml:id="d263fn2">In telegram 721 from Nairobi, <persName corresp="#p_AWH_1">Attwood</persName> suggested that the fact that
                            Africans wanted the President to win the U.S. election offered the
                            opportunity to exercise leverage in order to make <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> actions look like a victory for

                        do not believe it useful to explain position to <persName corresp="#p_KJO_1">Kenyatta</persName>, Dialo or others in terms domestic politics. Points
                        we must stand on are (1) that we cannot discuss these matters without <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> for reasons stated <gloss target="#t_Deptel_1">Deptel</gloss> 1001;<note n="3" xml:id="d263fn3"><ref target="#d261">Document 261</ref>.</note> and (2) that we are
                        not refusing to talk but do not think it unreasonable we should have
                        something to say re time, place, subject matter and level of representation.
                        We leave it to you to put best face possible on this position with <persName corresp="#p_KJO_1">Kenyatta</persName> and Commission and to put

                        be brought promptly to his attention on his return to Washington next week.
                        I know you are aware through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AWH_1">Attwood</persName> of the importance my government attaches to the
                        efforts of the Organization of African Unity to contribute to a solution of
                        the Congo problem. I wish to assure you personally that we are, as we have
                        made clear, anxious to cooperate with the Organization of African Unity in
                        every appropriate way. In particular, we desire to work in a friendly way
                        with the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Commission over which you
                        preside to achieve results beneficial to all concerned.</p>
                    <p>As you are also aware, our efforts to assist in a solution of the Congo
                        problem have consistently been directed at helping the sovereign government
                        of the Congo in response to its requests. This has been the case ever since
                        Congo independence irrespective of personalities, both in our support of the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and subsequently. The principle
                        involved is one which animates us in our assistance to countries throughout
                        the world, including many in Africa, and I am sure you will appreciate that
                        we cannot depart from it in this case. It would therefore be most improper
                        for us to discuss changes in our present limited assistance to the Congo
                        without the Congolese Government’s concurrence and participation. I am sure
                        you would agree that every other African nation would expect to be treated
                        with the same consideration.</p>
                    <p>We sincerely regret, as I am sure you do, the difficulties that have arisen
                        in connection with the proposed delegation from the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Commission. <pb n="386" facs="0419" xml:id="pg_386"/> I
                        wish to assure you that my Government wholeheartedly and unreservedly shares
                        the objective set forth in the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>
                        resolution, i.e., “to support and encourage the efforts of the Democratic
                        Republic of the Congo in the restoration of national reconciliation.” We
                        are, in this connection, pleased indeed that you have sent us your personal
                        representative and distinguished Minister of State, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJO_1">Joseph Murumbi</persName>. We hope that his visit
                        will make it possible for our two Governments constructively to direct our
                        energies toward the earliest possible attainment of a unified, peaceful and
                        genuinely independent Congo which will be able to play its full part with
                        other African states in realizing the potential of your great continent.</p>
                    <p>I appreciate very much the good will which has animated your own efforts in
                        these vital matters and I continue to hope for your success in bringing

                            the U.S. right to give aid to the Congo. Its only objective was to
                            obtain U.S. assistance in getting <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to respect a cease-fire. <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName> expressed the U.S. concern
                            that the Commission seemed to equate the legitimate government with the

                            a cease-fire, all areas of the Congo would be returned to central
                            government control, and once a coalition government was achieved, there

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJO_1">Murumbi</persName> made it clear to
                        Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName> that he
                        had come to the United States on a purely good will visit. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJO_1">Murumbi</persName> also made it clear that the
                        Commission recognizes that in any meetings of the delegation with the U.S.
                        Govt it would be inappropriate to discuss matters affecting the sovereignty
                        of the Dem <gloss target="#t_Rep_1">Rep</gloss> of the Congo.</p>
                    <p>In welcoming Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJO_1">Murumbi</persName>’s
                        assurances, Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName> asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJO_1">Murumbi</persName> to convey to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KJO_1">Kenyatta</persName> the sympathetic understanding of
                        the United States Government that the Prime Minister is engaged in a most
                        significant undertaking in the service of Africa, to the success of which
                        the United States attaches great importance. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName> asked that, with this in mind,
                        Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KJO_1">Kenyatta</persName> be assured
                        of the desire of the United States to cooperate with the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> in every appropriate way. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName> emphasized that the limited U.S.
                        military assistance to the Congo is at the request of the sovereign
                        Government of the Congo to assist it in maintaining law and order. He
                        pointed out that U.S. military assistance has been provided to the
                        Government of the Congo for a number of years, first through the United
                        Nations and, subsequently, under agreements fully consistent with <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolutions and with the final report of the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Secretary General on <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> operations in the Congo.</p>
                    <p>In acknowledging the sovereign rights of the Congo to request and accept
                        military assistance from the U.S., Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJO_1">Murumbi</persName> assured Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName> that this was not at issue. He explained that the
                        Commission’s objective was rather to seek the cooperation of the United
                        States in the Commission’s efforts to support and encourage the efforts of
                        the Government of the Congo in the restoration of national reconciliation.
                        In this connection, he welcomed Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName>’ assurances of cooperation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJO_1">Murumbi</persName> and Assistant Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName> agreed that the
                        conversation had been most helpful in clarifying the views of the Commission
                        and of the U.S. Government and in establishing a general framework for
                        cooperation between them.</p>
                    <p>It has also been arranged for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJO_1">Murumbi</persName> and M. <persName corresp="#p_PGR_1">Pognon</persName> to pay a courtesy call on the Secretary of State
                        before leaving Washington.”</p>
                    <p>If there is agreement by <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> delegation
                        language of first and last paras would be modified to show entire delegation
                        being received. In addition to Botsio, Beavogui (Guinea) also expected. In
                        his consultations <persName corresp="#p_MJO_1">Murumbi</persName> will
                        suggest other members, Nigeria and Ghana be represented by local
                        Ambassadors.</p>

                    <p>Nigeria’s Chargé informed of above and states present instructions would not
                        permit him participate as Nigeria considers mission to US ultra vires.
                        However, in light of proposed joint press statement recognizing sovereign
                        rights of Congo, is seeking new instructions. Since it obviously desirable
                        have Nigerians present you should point out changed circumstances to <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> and urge that Chargé or Adebo be
                        authorized attend. We also strongly prefer entire exercise be completed
                        tomorrow rather than have new round of publicity as would be case if
                        reception of <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> delegation delayed to
                        later date. Also preferable delegation be received before opening of
                        Non-Aligned Conference Cairo. Thus preferable an on-the-spot Nigerian
                        representative be authorized attend rather than have representative sent

                            than 1 line not declassified</hi>] in connection with military
                        operations in the Congo. These aircraft are loaned to the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> and are under their operational control
                        but the U.S. can take action to bar their use for missions of which we
                        disapprove.</p>
                    <p>2. On September 15, <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> Commander in Bukavu,
                        Colonel <persName corresp="#p_MGL_1">Mulamba</persName>, ordered T–28 pilots
                        not to strike (i.e. strafe) the town of Uvira but to continue attacking
                        concentrations of trucks and other equipment outside the town.</p>
                    <p>3. We have expressed to our Embassy in Leopoldville our strong concern at the
                        possibility that air attacks on Uvira might result in reprisals <pb n="391" facs="0424" xml:id="pg_391"/> against Europeans there and in other rebel
                        held areas. However, we have left it to the Leopoldville Country Team to
                        determine whether strikes within Uvira are essential from a military
                        viewpoint. They are to try to limit air strikes in the area to road and lake
                        traffic until such time as the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> is
                        prepared to launch a serious offensive against Uvira or the magnitude of the
                        rebel build-up clearly necessitates defensive action involving air strikes
                        on the town itself. Both conditions now prevail.</p>
                    <p>4. We are concerned over the possible consequences for Americans in
                        Stanleyville if air strikes on Uvira or other towns are permitted at this
                        time. The rebels put our Consular personnel under protective arrest when an
                        earlier air attack on Uvira was reported. They, moreover considered that air
                        attacks on Albertville occurred only after the evacuation of Europeans were
                        evacuated and appear to be determined to hold Europeans in Stanleyville,
                        particularly our Consular personnel, hostage to avoid air attacks on
                        Stanleyville. On the other hand air attacks on truck concentrations, etc.
                        outside of towns appears to have provoked no rebel retaliation against
                        Europeans.</p>
                    <p>Recommendation: That new instructions be sent to our Embassy in Leopoldville
                        that U.S.-supplied aircraft should not hit targets within Uvira or other
                        towns during the current negotiations of the International Red Cross with
                        the rebels for the evacuation of Americans and Europeans from Stanleyville.
                        This restriction should remain in effect as long as the Americans in
                        Stanleyville are in danger. There would, however, be no bar on air attacks
                        on targets outside towns, including the road from Uvira to Bukavu, a
                        strategic town currently threatened with rebel attack.</p>

                        and other delegates going out of their way to emphasize that there had been

                        essential to success their mission re Congo. Secretary pointed out US has no
                        important interests in Congo but has consistently supported unity and
                        integrity of country. We however consider Congo an African problem and were
                        therefore glad to see <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> take it up. One
                        reason we welcome efforts <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> to solve
                        Congo problem in African context was that we do not want to see injection
                        Cold War into Congo or elsewhere in Africa. At same time, we would not
                        shrink from our responsibilities if others chose inject it. Best way avoid
                        Cold War confrontation is for African states prevent <gloss target="#t_Chicom_1">Chicom</gloss> intrusion and to assist <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> to solve problem in manner which will make
                        outside military help unnecessary. He pointed out that while there was some

                    <p>In summary we hope Africans will come to assistance of Congo so Congolese

                        re keeping Cold War out of Africa and his assurance of cooperation with
                            <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Effort was made by Botsio to inject question of our military assistance to
                        Congo into discussion. He took line grounding of US-supplied <pb n="393" facs="0426" xml:id="pg_393"/>planes used for combat operations essential

                        Secretary said US-supplied combat planes were under operational control of
                            <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and Commission should address
                        itself in first instance to <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> on this

                        if Commission runs into difficulties there it may call upon US for

                    <p>Several members of delegation expressed appreciation for efforts made by Dept

                        US position of principle. There was a good deal of mutual congratulation

                    </list>
                    <p>1. This memorandum is for the information of the Director of Central
                        Intelligence.</p>
                    <p>2. During August 1964 the U.S. Air Force furnished three B–26 K aircraft to
                        the Congo, and <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> furnished four B–26 B
                        aircraft. The B–26 K’s were furnished for a limited period and are scheduled
                        for withdrawal from the Congo on 17 October 1964. It is Africa Division’s
                        understanding that the Department of Defense is prepared to extend this date
                        for an additional period if requested to do so. In discussions with the
                        Departments of State and Defense, Africa Division has taken the position
                        that the extension of the B–26 K’s in the Congo is a policy matter and that
                        the request to the Department of Defense for an extension should originate
                        with the Department of State. It was learned on 1 October 1964 that the
                        Department of State intends to submit such a request.</p>
                    <p>3. From an operational standpoint, Africa Division and Special Operations
                        Division think it necessary that the B–26 K’s be retained in the Congo for
                        an additional period of 60 days (or earlier if the situation changes in such
                        a way as to make them unnecessary), and that the 13 <gloss target="#t_USAF_1">USAF</gloss> maintenance personnel for these aircraft
                        remain until <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>-provided personnel are in
                        position and checked out to maintain them. This view is based on the
                        following considerations:</p>
                    <p>A. The Congolese Air Force is now operating from four widely dispersed bases
                        (Leopoldville, Kamina, Bukavu, and Lisala). Except for Bukavu, other combat
                        aircraft available (T–28’s and T–6’s) do not have adequate range to perform
                        all necessary missions in support of the Congolese National Army. The
                        effective T–28/T–6 combat radius under average conditions is 90 miles with
                        little reserve left for time over target. The B–26 under average conditions
                        has a combat radius of up to 500 miles with as much as an hour and a half
                        over target.</p>
                    <p>B. The <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> senior air operations officer in
                        the Congo has stated that the Congolese National Army troops do not perform
                        effectively without air support visible overhead.</p>
                    <pb n="395" facs="0428" xml:id="pg_395"/>
                    <p>C. The B–26 aircraft have the additional advantages of a twin engine safety
                        factor, better armament, a superior all-weather capability, and higher
                        speed.</p>
                    <p>D. The B–26 B aircraft provided by the Agency are much inferior to the <gloss target="#t_USAF_1">USAF</gloss> B–26 K’s. The Air Force has withdrawn
                        B–26 B’s from its inventory, and the Agency is planning to do the same
                        because of certain structural deficiencies in the B–26 B as well as the high
                        maintenance factor due to old age. The [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                            not declassified</hi>] pilots in the Congo have shown an awareness of
                        the structural deficiencies and a reluctance to utilize B–26 B aircraft.</p>
                    <p>5. The Director may wish to use the views expressed above should his opinions
                        on the importance of the B–26 K aircraft be sought.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>There is a very real possibility that, at any time over the next few weeks,
                        the rebels in Stanleyville may begin to abuse or kill American hostages
                        there—five official Americans, held briefly in prison and now in house
                        arrest, and up to fifteen other Americans (presumably missionary), precise
                        number and whereabouts unknown. If that happens (and we will probably have
                        little advance warning) we will either have to move quickly with pre-planned
                        force to get our people out or tolerate publicly Americans being killed in a
                        situation of primitive anarchy without timely response on our part to try to
                        prevent it. There are <pb n="397" facs="0430" xml:id="pg_397"/>5–800
                        Europeans also in Stanleyville, mostly Belgian but various others (British,
                        Greeks, Italians, etc.). There will be far less enthusiasm from these
                        countries for contingency planning, both because their people are relatively
                        safe unless and until the US actually uses force to rescue our people, and
                        because they have nationals in other parts of rebel held territory whose
                        danger would be heightened if they intervened militarily in
                        Stanleyville.</p>
                    <p>While I believe we should consult with Brussels, therefore, and (depending on
                        reactions there) perhaps elsewhere, I do not believe our own, independent
                        contingency planning should wait on consultation. If we delay, we may be
                        caught in a crisis with no capacity to act, or handicapped by Belgian
                        reluctance to act. To be realistic, our planning must include the possible
                        need for quick capture of the city.<note n="2" xml:id="d274fn2">The last

                    <p>Rebel leadership in Stanleyville has made it clear that the official
                        Americans are hostage against air attacks on Stanleyville (they apparently
                        don’t blame or threaten Europeans). It is also clear that they don’t fully
                        control the Jeunesse guerrillas or the population, and are fearful that air
                        attack on Stanleyville or perhaps even on other towns will cause mob
                        violence they can’t control against Americans in Stanleyville (it is widely
                        believed that US planes bombed Albertville <hi rend="italic">after</hi>
                        Europeans were evacuated and this has terrorized rebels and civilians in
                        rebel-held towns). And indeed, the relatively heavily-armed B–26s represent
                        such an escalation of anything ever experienced in this part of Africa that
                        they have caused a profound psychological shock which contributes to this
                        panicky and potentially dangerous state among the Congolese. There is
                        already some indication of abuse of the official Americans (Khartoum’s 138

                    <p>This problem is going to get worse as the Congo army’s offensive moves toward
                        Stanleyville and pressure for air attack on towns increases (<persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> was delighted by the reports of

                    <p>If this analysis is right we should at once start <gloss target="#t_CINCSTRIKE_1">CINCSTRIKE</gloss> on contingency planning,
                        obviously as discreetly as possible but not waiting for European
                        consultations. At the same time, we can ask State to consider the
                        feasibility of consultations with Belgians and others as appropriate to try
                        to multilateralize planning and to put the total problem before the
                        Secretary, and, if he thinks it necessary, put it before the President at an

                        at State on this problem and would propose to take the above line if you

                        desirable.</p>
                    <p>We appreciate continuing efforts which your government has made in furthering
                        our common aims in the Congo in pursuance <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName>
                        August talks. Belgian response has been major factor in stiffening internal
                        security of Congo, affording hope that rebellion can be contained and,
                        hopefully, beginning made in rolling it back. Such a posture of strength,
                        coupled with a Congolese attitude of reasonableness <pb n="399" facs="0432" xml:id="pg_399"/> and flexibility, may make it possible for progress on
                        political negotiations which would insure a continued moderate, pro-Western
                        government and at same time reduce to a minimum bloodshed and economic and
                        social dislocation arising from rebellion.</p>
                    <p>We have been particularly encouraged by steps you have recently taken to
                        supply “equipes Polyvalentes” which could ensure a stable administration and
                        development of Congo in future. We have also been pleased at your action in
                        sending Rothschild to Leopoldville which will, we are confident, help
                        greatly in assuring that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        receives sound advice both in dealing with his internal problems and in
                        adopting a cooperative and flexible relationship with <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Commission.</p>
                    <p>As you know, we sent C–130’s to Congo to meet special emergency. Therefore,
                        because the original purpose for sending them to the Congo no longer
                        obtains, because they have received an inordinate amount of publicity and
                        because of urgent needs to discharge our heavy worldwide commitments
                        elsewhere, we are planning at an early date to begin withdrawal of our
                        C–130’s and joint task force which accompanies it. We must be sure therefore
                        that <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> has sufficient logistic support
                        airlift capability to maintain its military effort, including additional
                        responsibilities which will be placed upon it when <persName corresp="#p_VCF_1">Van der Walle</persName> plan goes into action. It is
                        considered opinion our civilian and military officials in Congo that after
                        necessary positioning of troops and equipment to implement plan, sufficient
                        airlift capability exists in FAC and Air Congo to meet anticipated needs
                        except for possible special heavy hauls. Problem, however, is to assure that
                        existing Congolese airlift capability is operational. We understand problems
                        that you have been having in providing air crews and maintenance and supply
                        personnel for C–47’s and H–21 helicopters. We greatly hope that letter which
                        we now understand <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> has sent
                        you will make it possible for you to supply required personnel to put these
                        Congolese planes in the air, thereby relieving us of temporary
                        responsibilities we have assumed and which have continued much longer than
                        we had anticipated. This step would make it possible for U.S. to withdraw on
                        a phased basis four C–130’s and cease using one or two other aircraft with
                        U.S. markings for unusual missions such as C–47 which has been performing
                        reconnaissance and other functions in defense of Bukavu because of
                        unavailability of FAC aircraft.</p>
                    <p>A further problem relates to supply of rockets and ammunition. As you know,
                        airlift of such items from Belgium to Congo is expensive, hazardous, and
                        politically delicate in terms of transit through Wheelus Air Base and at
                        Kano, as well as overflight rights other African countries. We are most
                        pleased that our respective representatives have now made progress in
                        determining recurring needs for ammunition in the <pb n="400" facs="0433" xml:id="pg_400"/>Congo and that you are instituting necessary
                        arrangements to supply <gloss target="#t_ammo_1">ammo</gloss> on a regular
                        basis by sea which would eliminate further emergency airlifts. We strongly
                        hope that it will be possible to continue to proceed on this basis and
                        thereby to eliminate any need for further emergency airlifts.</p>
                    <p>From recent communications we gather that continued supply of <gloss target="#t_ammo_1">ammo</gloss> is posing some financial problems for
                        you. We sincerely hope in this regard that you will find it possible to
                        overcome these difficulties in order that flow of rockets and ammunition so
                        necessary for <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> military effort will not
                        be interrupted. In this connection, I would appreciate your thoughts on
                        possibilities of approaching other Western European countries again for
                        possible assistance which they might be able to render both in form of
                        ammunition and otherwise. We realize that our talks with representatives
                        these countries in August were largely inconclusive, but I believe we must
                        continue to impress on them importance of stability in Central Africa and
                        urge them do their part. In this connection, we would most willingly support
                        such approaches as you would find it possible to make in other Western
                        European capitals. As I have said, I would greatly appreciate your views on
                        best way to go about this as matter high priority.</p>
                    <p>Please be assured that we will continue to accept and discharge our
                        obligations in Congo in closest harmony and consultation with you and your
                        Government. It would greatly assist us in our planning both with respect to
                        Congo and our worldwide obligations, if you could let me have your earliest
                        possible views on foregoing problems, including your estimate as to when we
                        can expect air personnel for C–47’s to arrive in the Congo.</p>

                        costly emergency airlift. (My feeling was that to use word “hope” might
                        weaken presentation and lead certain Belgian officials to think that if they
                        did not arrange adequate, timely sealift of <gloss target="#t_ammo_1">ammo</gloss>, we would perhaps supply both airlift and <gloss target="#t_ammo_1">ammo</gloss> itself.)</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> replied as follows:</p>
                    <p>1. Belgians realize US airlift of <gloss target="#t_ammo_1">ammo</gloss> to
                        Congo was to meet special emergency and understand reasons why we must soon
                        begin phased withdrawal from Congo of C–130s. He also agrees Belg aircrews
                        should be sent to Congo soonest now <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> has signed necessary letter. He does not know
                        schedule for sending such crews but will inquire of <gloss target="#t_MOD_1">MOD</gloss> and endeavor expedite their departure. He promised to let
                        us know about this ASAP.</p>
                    <p>2. He agrees Belgium should supply rockets and <gloss target="#t_ammo_1">ammo</gloss> to meet needs of <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> and
                        adequate and timely sealift and will ask his people to look into this
                        problem with a view to assuring necessary arrangements.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> does not believe other
                        Western European countries will be willing at present to provide military or
                        other assistance in addition to what they are now doing because of
                        uncertainties and instabilities in Congo and hostility of certain African
                        and non-aligned states to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        govt. Therefore, he does not believe it worthwhile to approach other Western
                        European countries for assistance at this time.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> then made following general
                        comments on Congo picture. While militarily things not going badly
                        politically Congo is chaotic and future most uncertain. Furthermore econ
                        picture is deteriorating. Serious situation will have to be faced in a few
                        months. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> understands rebellion
                        has resulted in reduction of about one third of Congo exports with obvious
                        long term effect on Congo foreign exchange budget, especially when rebel
                        territories regained and sizeable additional imports necessary to avoid
                        galloping inflation with serious political and social repercussions.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> does not seem willing to
                        reorganize his govt by end October. He advances number of reasons why this
                        would be very difficult and why <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> would be opposed to including certain Congolese
                        leaders. While <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> ready to join
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> govt, <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> much more reserved and insists that
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> negotiate with <persName corresp="#p_GCH_1">Gbenye</persName>. However since <persName corresp="#p_GCH_1">Gbenye</persName> unwilling <pb n="402" facs="0435" xml:id="pg_402"/> to have anything to do with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> there obviously no hope of any
                        talks between them. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> said he
                        had reached conclusion that <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GCH_1">Gbenye</persName> negotiations neither feasible
                        nor desirable.</p>
                    <p>While <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> has engaging
                        personality and probably considerable public support in Congo he is not a
                        team player. Recently he has shown increasing authoritarian tendencies which
                        in themselves would not be bad if he had the capability of organizing and
                        running Congo. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> doubts he has
                        such capability and said <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        obviously needs help. However <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> does not trust Africans and relies largely on
                        Belgian and other white advisors.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> said this attitude of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s raised a major question in mind
                        of Belgian Govt. Question is extent to which Belgian advisors and technical
                        assistance should assume authority and hence responsibility for taking over
                        the de facto running of the Congo under plan such as Rothschild has in mind
                        (Leoville 1361 to Dept).<note n="4" xml:id="d276fn4">Dated October 5.
                            (Ibid., POL 15 THE CONGO)</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> said there is difference of
                        opinion within <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> on this. While all agree
                        that Belgium must supply adequate technical assistance, there are those who
                        have serious reservations about the wisdom of assuming considerable de facto
                        authority and responsibility as this will leave Belgium open to charges of
                        neo-colonialism. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> said Belgians
                        must of course act with circumspection and tact so as to reduce
                        vulnerability to such charges.</p>
                    <p>I asked <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> whether he meant that
                        concept of “equipes Polyvalentes” might not be implemented because of risk
                        of charges of neo-colonialism. He replied furnishing of technicians not the
                        issue but rather it was degree of their authority and responsibility which
                        raised questions. This issue would be considered rather in the next several
                        days. I commented that while fully agreeing that Belgian assistance should
                        be handled in way to make it least vulnerable to charges of neo-colonialism,
                        I personally did not believe Congo could be stabilized without very
                        substantial Belgian advice and assistance to Congolese which inevitably
                        would carry with it a degree of responsibility. My feeling was that without
                        such substantial Belgian advice and technical assistance the Congo could
                        come apart at the seams since Congolese themselves not yet capable of
                        administering and managing their own affairs.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> replied he inclined to agree
                        but whole Congolese picture chaotic and uncertain and many people in Belgium
                        reluctant to have Belgians assume positions of authority and responsibility,
                        even if camouflaged with Congolese cover, because they remember how entire
                        world had turned on Belgium in 1960.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Personally believe <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> will be prepared to see Belgians
                        assume minimum necessary responsibility because alternative <pb n="403" facs="0436" xml:id="pg_403"/>would seem to be to let Congo go by
                        default. Rothschild with whom we talked separately shares this view. However
                        decision on Rothschild plan will probably not be taken before end of this
                        week or early next week.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Mr. President:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>I thank you very much for your letter of September 25, regarding the visit to
                        the United States by a delegation from the Ad Hoc Commission of the
                        Organization of African Unity.<note n="2" xml:id="d277fn2"><ref target="#d264">Document 264</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>By now you will have heard from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> that in our discussions with the delegation, we have
                        steadfastly stood on the principles that we could not discuss matters
                        affecting the sovereignty of the Congo, including the question of our aid
                        relationship. When this point was accepted by the delegation, a friendly
                        meeting with the Secretary of State was arranged. It is my hope that this
                        meeting demonstrates that the United States intends to abide by
                        international rules respecting national sovereignty and, at the same time,
                        has emphasized the sincerity of the United States Government in offering any
                        appropriate aid to the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Commission in
                        the fulfillment of its task.</p>
                    <p>The United States continues to believe that <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> participation in the search for solutions to the Congo
                        problem, requested by the Congo itself, can be a valuable contribution to
                        the progress of the whole of Africa, I have been pleased to note that your
                        Government has maintained a calm and constructive attitude by indicating its
                        willingness to cooperate fully with the Commission within the terms of its
                        mandate, and <pb n="404" facs="0437" xml:id="pg_404"/>by reiterating its
                        earlier invitation to the Commission to visit the Congo.</p>
                    <p>The Congo’s own efforts augmented by those of the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> and its other friends will soon, I am sure, assure the
                        restoration of order in the Congo, permitting it to proceed on the vital
                        task of economic and social development. In your efforts to accomplish these

                        grave <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> concern over venture which can

                        challenge sovereignty <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>. At time when
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> should be seeking
                        strengthen position in <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>, he would be
                        creating opposite impression by introducing additional South Africans,
                        particularly in conspicuous role of killing Africans from air. He should
                        appreciate that mercenaries are probably most vulnerable aspect of his
                        relations with other Africans. We and other qualified observers are
                        convinced that militarily these planes are not necessary for Congolese
                        military success. We convinced planes we have furnished are sufficient to do

                        pilots would not be adding military strength commensurate with serious
                        political disadvantages.</p>
                    <p>We recognize that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> may have
                        serious doubts about US intentions in continuing to make available to him
                        air support for <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> operations and thus has
                        undertaken South African pilot project to give himself an independent
                        capability. We suggest you sound him out on <pb n="407" facs="0440" xml:id="pg_407"/>this and, if appropriate, you may reaffirm that US
                        tactical aircraft now on loan to <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> will
                        continue to be fully available for action against appropriate military
                        targets for duration of military need. In this connection, you should make
                        clear our understanding that aircraft will be used only against essential
                        military targets and within spirit of Geneva Conventions, thus avoiding
                        towns and cities. We hope <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        would readily accept this line of reasoning, not only for humanitarian
                        reasons but also in interest economic future of country and eventual
                        national reconciliation.</p>
                    <p>If helpful, you can specifically reiterate that C–130 lift will be phased out
                        only as adequate C–47 lift becomes available and that, with appropriate
                        mutual understanding re South African pilot project, B–26s can be retained
                        beyond present Oct. 17 expiration date. You can also assure him of continued
                        availability of T–28s on basis of similar understanding. <gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss> In offering such oral assurances you
                        should of course stay strictly within limits of carefully formulated terms
                        of foregoing. End <gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>2. If this argumentation and these assurances fail to elicit assurances from
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> that he will abandon
                        project, you should attempt persuade him at least to defer movement from
                            <gloss target="#t_Leo_1">Leo</gloss> pending joint resolution of this
                        issue.</p>
                    <p>3. At any point in this sequence and in order to dissuade him from project or
                        persuade him defer, you are authorized use in ascending order any or all
                        following additional points:</p>
                    <p>a. US cannot agree airlift additional T–6’s from Italy. (If you are sure that
                        we retain title and withdrawal rights over two operational T–6’s referred
                        reftel, you may also say we would have to insist on their withdrawal.)</p>
                    <p>b. Since we cannot agree to be associated in any way with South African
                        airforce operations, we would be forced withdraw US supplied aircraft from
                        Lisala-Coq vicinity so long as T–6’s active in that area.</p>
                    <p>c. In absence of an appropriate mutual understanding re South African pilot
                        project, we would find it impossible extend B–26 agreement covering their
                        loan to <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> beyond Oct. 17 expiry date and
                        aircraft must consequently be grounded beforehand to prepare them
                        mechanically for return to US.</p>
                    <p>d. You have full authorization of <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> to

                    <p>1. I share your deep concern about the official and non-official Americans
                        held as hostages by rebel authorities in Stanleyville. The attached
                        report—the first we have received which contained detail—reminds us sharply
                        of the jeopardy in which the Americans find themselves.<note n="2" xml:id="d284fn2">Attached to the original is intelligence report TDCS DB
                            315/01019–64, October 14, describing the Congo rebels’ mistreatment of
                            U.S. consular personnel since the fall of Stanleyville. It also reported
                            that <persName corresp="#p_GCH_1">Gbenye</persName> had told <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> representative Senn in September
                            that he was afraid he could not control the situation and did not know
                            what the reaction of the rebel troops would be if he released the
                            Americans.</note> Given the mercurial temperament of the Congolese, the
                        specific anti-Americanism of the Stanleyville rebels based on their
                        conviction that the U.S. is responsible for <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s attacks against them, and the likelihood of
                        further rebel reverses, we must, I believe, conclude that Americans are in
                        grave danger. Moreover, as Congolese forces move toward Stanleyville during
                        the coming few weeks, the vulnerability of the American hostages will
                        sharply increase.</p>

                    <p>2. I know you will agree that this information lends a new urgency to
                        contingency planning for the rescue of the Americans which we and <gloss target="#t_CINCSTRIKE_1">CINCSTRIKE</gloss> have been conducting. You
                        will recall that we sent a planner to Leopoldville in early September and
                        since then have pre-positioned other personnel and equipment in the Congo.
                        It is our understanding that <gloss target="#t_CINCSTRIKE_1">CINCSTRIKE</gloss> is preparing to send four officers to Leopoldville
                        to do on-the-ground, detailed contingency planning. We, of course, stand
                        ready to help them in any way we can.</p>
                    <p>3. We are continuing our efforts to acquire information on the Stanleyville
                        situation and will keep you informed of our results.</p>

                    <p><gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> has requested <gloss target="#t_CINCSTRIKE_1">CINCSTRIKE</gloss> to prepare to implement
                        either of two plans previously prepared for this evacuation. <gloss target="#t_CINCSTRIKE_1">CINCSTRIKE</gloss> has replied that neither of
                        the plans was appropriate at present and is forwarding a new plan (USJTF
                        OPLAN 514—Ready Move 3).</p>
                    <p>The exact details of this plan are not yet available in Washington but from
                        the attached messages the following outline can be seen:</p>
                    <p>1. Mission is to seize and secure Stanleyville, evacuate non-Congolese, and
                        turn city over to friendly government.</p>
                    <p>2. Intelligence estimates indicate the enemy situation in Stanleyville
                        represents a greater capability than existed in early September, therefore a
                        larger force is necessary. This would comprise a small air strike force and
                        an airborne battalion for initial assault, with a second airborne battalion
                        ready at a forward staging base to be called forward if required.</p>
                    <pb n="414" facs="0447" xml:id="pg_414"/>
                    <p>3. Two routing plans are presented, with plan I–B being recommended.</p>
                    <p>I–B calls for staging through Wheelus with a D-day, H-hour, 55 hours and 55
                        minutes after the execution order.</p>
                    <p>I–C calls for staging through Liberia and Ascension Island with a D-day,
                        H-hour, 59 hours and 50 minutes after the execution order.</p>
                    <p>4. The forces currently under Defcon 4 alert for this operation consist

                    <p>Am deeply concerned, however, by starkness of message I have to deliver and
                        fear reactions of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Nendaka</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>. In fact <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> may well know of our decision even before I can see
                        him because of our action early this morning in standing down crucial air
                        strikes scheduled in Burma and Boende areas. Furthermore, while I will
                        obviously not tell <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> that US
                        planes no longer flying over rebel held area, Congolese will probably become
                        aware of this during course of day when <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>
                        request for reconnaissance around Bukavu and Uvira, point still under grave
                        rebel threat, is refused. Department will, of course, realize that grounding
                        of planes will mean complete stoppage of all military offensive operations
                        against rebels, as all current operations depend on air support by US
                        furnished planes.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> is going to ask right away,
                        or at least ask himself, what <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> has in
                        mind, i.e., does this mean US proposing give in to rebel blackmail re
                        hostages and thus getting ready pull out military rug from under him, at
                        least as far as crucial support from US-furnished planes is concerned. Or,
                        he will want to know, does this mean <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                        has something more positive in mind. I can see reasons why we would not
                        necessarily want to take <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        into our confidence at this stage if latter is case. However, I believe it

                        keep him from having to consider possibility, which Department has
                        recognized, of reversing his decision re non use South African mercenary

                        considering withdrawal of its aerial support. In other words, I would like

                        not mean give in to rebel blackmail.</p>

                    <p>We must face fact that 72-hour stand down, even though not immediately known
                        to rebels, could result in some substantial rebel victories. For example,
                        last time reconnaissance around Bukavu stopped, rebels quickly took occasion
                        launch major attack on that city which nearly fell. Unless Belgians
                        undertake reconnaissance, US could be in position of being blamed for fall

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_MJA_1">McCone</persName> called to say that he was
                        terribly troubled over this 72 hour timing in the Congo. This could spell
                        the undoing of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s success.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> said that he had talked to
                        Mac <persName corresp="#p_BMG_1">Bundy</persName> this morning and it seems
                        to him this is a situation where the President has got to have a look. The
                        reason for the 72 hours is to give him a chance to personally review it.
                        They are trying to get some ground rules out. One of our people came back
                        from talking with the Belgians who agree that the five people, apart from
                        the other Americans, are in very serious jeopardy with the use of the
                        planes. What Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> wants to do
                        and what <persName corresp="#p_BMG_1">Bundy</persName> agreed to today was
                        that they would try to get the matter to the President and then go ahead and
                        do what they have to.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA_1">McCone</persName> said that the only thing
                        that has held those Congolese forces together has been the air support. They
                        would have disintegrated in the absence of same. He said he realized the
                        danger to the 30 people. On the other hand we brought great pressure on the
                        Belgians to do what they have done even though <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> felt he was putting several thousand Belgians at risk.
                        There is a big stake and while he has every feeling for the 26 people if we
                        establish a Communist cancer in the middle of dark Africa the consequences
                        are going to be many times more serious than 26 people.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> said that he thought the
                        problem is that he (<persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName>) would feel
                        very reluctant to see this operation go much further until the President
                        knows. He said that we had had word today that the whole story <pb n="419" facs="0452" xml:id="pg_419"/>of the hostages has been filed. The
                        Department is going to try to get somebody out to Chicago to squelch the
                            story—<hi rend="italic">Chicago Daily News</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> said that our people back
                        from Brussels say that the Belgians have a somewhat different appraisal of
                        the situation. He said that <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>
                        had a date with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> today and we
                        were waiting for the telegram. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> said he appreciated <persName corresp="#p_MJA_1">McCone</persName>’s feelings and said that there were some different
                        views over here.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_MJA_1">McCone</persName> mentioned that when he had
                        wanted to get the 130’s out and put some covert C 54’s in <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> raised hell.</p>

                        line with our continuing desire to provide <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> with air support, we want to propose general formula under
                        which <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and US air operations in Congo
                        can be carried out which meets both <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and
                        US requirements. Limiting factors of particular concern to us are dangers
                        rebel reprisals against American hostages Stanleyville and possible use
                        South African piloted planes by <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>. Any
                        formula for air operations must take these factors into account. You should
                        emphasize significance <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> attaches to
                        safety of hostages and say that danger to them precludes using planes in
                        ways which clearly risk reprisals on them. In similarly frank and realistic
                        vein you should make clear that association with operations in which <gloss target="#t_SA_1">SA</gloss> pilots engaged is unacceptable to <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> in view effect on both <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and US images and positions in the world.
                        Against this background you should propose the following formula to

                    <p>1. He should take an initiative, based on humanitarian grounds, to make clear
                        to rebels and to world that he will not make air attacks against cities or

                        Stanleyville. In event rebels dig in to hold any town, we would consider

                        enhance safety Congolese, American and other civilian population there.)</p>
                    <p>4. Communications would invite <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> and
                        Commission <gloss target="#t_reps_1">reps</gloss> to Leopoldville to discuss
                        modalities, but would make clear that <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                        unilateral undertaking becomes effective immediately.</p>
                    <p>We believe foregoing not only helps solve problem of hostages but provides
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> excellent opportunity to
                        seize initiative, gaining stature in African and world forums for
                        statesmanlike act and putting rebels on defensive. In tactical sense too he
                        gains the initiative. Instead of <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and
                        its associates laboring under threat of rebels to take punitive act against
                        foreigners if <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> hits cities from air, it
                        is now <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> which implicitly threatens
                        rebels with punitive act if rebels break international law.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> may argue that proposed
                        formula implies equal status for rebels. You should respond that Article 3
                        of Geneva Conventions is solely humanitarian, not political, in objective.
                        Article 3 specifically states that its provisions shall not affect the legal
                        status of the parties to the conflict. The Conventions further stated that
                        an impartial humanitarian body such as the <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> may offer its services to the parties to the conflict. For
                        the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Commission to cooperate with the
                            <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> and the parties to the conflict
                        for the purpose of Article 3 is consistent with the Conventions and carries
                        no political implications. Moreover, you might point out that even in the
                        absence of the Geneva Conventions <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> as <gloss target="#t_PM_1">PM</gloss> of <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> has full authority to invite <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>
                        Commission or anyone he wishes to any part of his territory for any proper
                        purpose. Thus it could be argued that deployment of such representatives <pb n="421" facs="0454" xml:id="pg_421"/> for humanitarian ends at <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> request is completely consistent with
                            <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> sovereignty.</p>
                    <p>If you consider useful you might point out to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> initiative we suggesting would permit him provide
                        statesmanlike rationale for self-imposed restraints which consistent with
                        realities of our unpublicized requirements.</p>
                    <p>If appropriate in course of discussions with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, you are authorized to inform him that withdrawal
                        second C–130 will be delayed pursuant to your recommendations. Please advise

Following <persName corresp="#p_BWH_1">Brubeck</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> conversation tonight, <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> is calling <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> immediately to urge importance of
                        seeing Ambassador soonest and to impress on <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> need to cooperate in our proposal for control of air
                        operations and for public statements thereon.</p>
                    <p>In light of <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> proposed
                        approach to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> we believe you
                        should, in first conversation with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, avoid any implication of threat of US control or
                        withdrawal of aircraft, and you should not ask <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> himself to stand-down aircraft. Approach should be
                        confined to stressing importance of problems and imminence of danger to
                        foreign nationals Stanleyville, and to urging, for this reason, need for
                        proposed statement by <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> at
                        earliest time.</p>
                    <p>You should also stress humanitarian concern for all civilians and all foreign
                        nationals affected, avoiding stress on US official hostages at
                        Stanleyville.</p>

                    <p>You should further make clear that our support for this approach is in part
                        because we believe it is best way to prevent series of escalating blackmail
                        demands by rebels based on threats to foreign nationals. You should point
                        out that, in any event, as stated in Secretary’s letter, US is firm in
                        support to <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and will not withdraw

                        apologized profusely and said <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> promises phone me tomorrow morning himself to
                        establish an appointment then. Have since confirmed that he similarly stood

                    <p>We know from <gloss target="#t_CAS_1">CAS</gloss> that he was meeting

                        Belgian Ambassador confirmed to me that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> still there at 1745. It is quite logical that they
                        subsequently went to <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>’s. We
                        are, of course, not certain what they discussing, but we gave “Christine”
                        text contained in Department telegram 992<note n="2" xml:id="d292fn2">See
                                <ref target="#d291fn2">footnote 2, Document 291</ref>.</note> this
                        morning. We assume that she gave them to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and that immediately he began consulting with his
                        two closest advisors <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Nendaka</persName>. We also know that
                        Congolese have intercepted telegram sent by <persName corresp="#p_SGE_1">Soumialot</persName> to Burundi King and believe it is that quoted in
                            <gloss target="#t_FBIS_1">FBIS</gloss> London’s R–192025Z. Believe
                        foregoing is all rather ominous for <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Nendaka</persName>,
                        I fear, will be violently opposed to what Department has proposed to
                            <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName>. It is unfortunate
                        that we gave Christine text this morning, but as we were informed <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> was forwarding them, such action
                        was, of course, essential. (<persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> message received but badly garbled.)</p>
                    <p>If, as I fear, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s attitude
                        will be negative, we seem to have painted ourselves into a corner. <gloss target="#t_VDW_1">VDW</gloss> plan, now highlighted by Boende phase,
                        depends on Congo air support. With arrival equipment from Belgium
                        approximately October 25, columns from Kamina should be about ready move
                        out. Here again, however, it will depend upon air support. By this time
                        rebels, who were being deluged by messages from everyone and who, as
                        indicated in <gloss target="#t_FBIS_1">FBIS</gloss> R–192035, are handling
                        them very adroitly, will certainly be aware of stand down. If <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> does not budge and if we do not,
                        valuable time will be lost and there is, of course, ever present danger of
                        recognition of rebels. In this connection have just received following from

                        you have done with our aviation”. I replied that it unfortunate he and I had

                        everything he could to help. Told him that recommended message <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> had sent him essential including
                        modifications contained Department telegram 992. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> understood modifications and said
                        he would issue communiqué immediately but he could not mention <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>. I argued on this point, but he inquired
                        how could we ask <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> send someone
                        Stanleyville when they might select such a rascal (his word much stronger)
                        as Diallo <persName corresp="#p_TBD_1">Telli</persName> whose capacity for
                        mischief would be unlimited. I had previously read him <gloss target="#t_FBIS_1">FBIS</gloss> R–192035 and told him I thought that his
                        early issuance of communiqué would <pb n="426" facs="0459" xml:id="pg_426"/>take winds out of <persName corresp="#p_SGE_1">Soumialot</persName>’s
                        sails. He granted this point, but then said “his people” were categorically
                        opposed to running such risk. I said I did not see how he could stop <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> acceding to <persName corresp="#p_SGE_1">Soumialot</persName>’s request and he said this specifically excluded
                        by Addis terms of reference and subsequent discussions Nairobi.</p>
                    <p>We ended that I personally understood his position as far as <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> concerned and would recommend strongly
                        that my Government not insist on its inclusion in communiqué. Asked if he

                        shortly thereafter saying he wished rush back to office to send me

                        Article 3 which in any event has primary applicability to Stanleyville. With

                        this point for subsequent discussion and negotiation with him. We regard it

                        extraordinary action in publishing it without full consultation with us
                        despite six days of effort on your part and our part with <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> to evolve mutually acceptable

                        and support which we are extending to strengthen <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and accomplishments its objectives, we fail to understand
                        his lack of responsiveness on matter of very fundamental concern to us. In
                        these circumstances, we must make clear to him necessity of finding more
                        satisfactory basis on which to conduct our relationship. Point of departure
                        must be an immediate and satisfactory resolution of problems which
                        communiqué fails to meet. We certain that he too attaches sufficient

                        to understanding and meeting our concern.</p>
                    <p>Against this background, you should give <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> following draft letters:</p>
                    <p>First should be addressed to President <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss>
                        and should read as follows:</p>
                    <p>“On October 21, I issued the attached statement in order to make clear the
                        desire of the <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> to abide by the Geneva
                        Conventions and to show our respect for generous humanitarian measures which
                        would avoid needless suffering by civilians. I similarly called on those who
                            <pb n="428" facs="0461" xml:id="pg_428"/>are illegally in rebellion
                        against my Government similarly to respect these conventions and to protect
                        human life.</p>
                    <p>In the spirit of this announcement, I am directing my air force to limit its
                        actions to military objectives and not to conduct strikes against cities and
                        important localities which would endanger the civilian population. <gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss>. Language of this sentence is deliberately
                        ambiguous because of unresolved State/Defense issue. State position is that
                        cities and important localities should not be hit at all because such action
                        would endanger civilian populations. Defense position is that military
                        objectives in cities and important localities are legitimate targets and
                        should be hit if in so doing civilian populations are not endangered.
                        State/Defense differences will be resolved Oct 22 in context control
                        guidance which will be sent you through other channels. For purposes this
                        statement, however, it essential that ambiguity be maintained and that

                        verify compliance of my Government with the undertakings of my announcement
                        of yesterday and of this letter. I assure you of the full cooperation of my
                        Government in providing facilities to carry out its mission.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, I urge you to make every effort to send an observer to
                        Stanleyville for similar purposes and to verify compliance of rebel
                        authorities there with the applicable provisions of the Geneva Conventions.
                        In order to assist you in this objective I am addressing a letter to the

                        reads as follows:</p>
                    <p>“Dear Mr. Prime Minister: I am enclosing a copy of a letter which I have sent
                        today to the President of the <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> urging
                        that organization to send impartial observers to Leopoldville and
                        Stanleyville to observe and verify compliance by the <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> and the rebels in Stanleyville with the

                        set forth in my letter to the <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>In your capacity as Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Ad
                        Hoc Commission, I urge you to assist the <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> in obtaining the agreement of the Stanleyville rebels to

                    <p>You should urge <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to send and
                        publish these letters immediately.</p>
                    <p>You should also again make clear to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> in strongest terms that employment of South African
                        T–6’s will pose grave problem for US-Congolese relations and put in question
                        continued US military assistance. <gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss>. You
                        should of course make every effort prevent deployment and deny support of
                        any US airlift or matériel to T–6 operation. End <gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>You should reaffirm our desire to cooperate fully with <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> in restoring peace, referring again to
                        Secretary’s letter. You should likewise point out that, in fact, air support
                        has continued for urgent needs, despite your inability to see <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and to get solution to problem of
                        overriding importance to US. You can cite, e.g. air ops at Bukavu,
                        reconnaissance at Boende and logistic flights. You should point out,
                        however, that inability to resolve this problem in manner that protects
                        interests of US as well as <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> will raise
                        serious question as to continued cooperation in air ops. You should again
                        point out that purpose of statement is to put an end to Stanleyville
                        blackmail threat, strengthen position of <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>, and make possible effective US military and political
                        support, including air ops. It is not our purpose to deny <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> support essential to its military
                        requirements and as problems arise we willing to consult with <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> to ensure satisfactory solution. We
                        cannot however accept situation in which with heavy US commitments and
                        risks, there is inadequate consultation and failure to respect interests of
                            US.<note n="3" xml:id="d295fn3">In telegram 1580 from Leopoldville,

                        STRUELENS OF THE CONGO EMBASSY—11:00 AM, October 22, 1964</p>
                    <p>We reviewed the events of the past week in the Congo and I explained to
                            <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> the approach <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> will be making to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> today, regarding letters to the
                        Red Cross and <persName corresp="#p_KJO_1">Kenyatta</persName>. I explained
                        that we are deeply concerned with two points:</p>
                    <p>1. That the Congolese Government should make a public record of assurances
                        regarding restraint of attacks against cities, and</p>
                    <p>2. That we must have some better basis for dealing with the Congolese
                        Government in order to insure candor, cooperation and mutual confidence and
                        ability to consult promptly and frequently when necessary.</p>
                    <p>I pointed out that the United States Government, with the very great
                        commitments it has made in the Congo, must be assured that its interests are
                        understood and protected and that the events of the past week—our Ambassador
                        tried unsuccessfully for six days to see <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> only to be confronted with a fait accompli in the
                        form of a press release on which there had been no consultation—was a very
                        serious matter.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> agreed that the communiqué
                        was unsatisfactory and that the failure to consult and to see <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> was unacceptable. He explained
                        partially in terms of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s
                        staff preventing <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>’s
                        appointment, and partly in terms of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s problem of dealing with <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Nendaka</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>. He insisted that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> does have confidence in the United States
                        commitments to his Government. He believes, however, that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> is much constrained by the
                        difficulties of handling <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, and
                        that in any event the Congolese leaders are not sufficiently experienced or
                        sophisticated fully to appreciate the problems and how to handle them. He
                        believes that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has become very
                        anti-American and is disposed to turn to the South Africans for air
                        operational support.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> will
                        call me tonight to learn what success <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> has had with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. Depending on that report, he will probably call
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> himself to underline the
                        concern of the <pb n="431" facs="0464" xml:id="pg_431"/>United States and to
                        urge <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to work closely with
                            <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>. If <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> agrees, <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> will proceed to Leopoldville
                        Sunday or Monday in order to talk to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> before <persName corresp="#p_BWH_1">Brubeck</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName>
                        arrive. I said, without giving any indication of our other travel plans,
                        that we expected to be in Leopoldville probably Wednesday for “a couple of
                        days” would hope to see <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        Wednesday and if necessary again on Thursday and that our primary concern
                        was to assure a close working relationship between the two Governments on
                        the basis of mutual understanding.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> gives every indication of
                        understanding our concern, being prepared to cooperate in his discussions
                        with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and quite clear where
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s true interests lie. I
                        have the impression, however, that he is not too confident of his own role
                        and the extent of his influence with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. He may well have used up some of his credit in the
                        effort he has already made with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> on other issues.</p>

                        Washington, were sounded out by the Department about the possibility of
                        providing assistance, including the provision of limited forces, to the
                        Congo. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> of
                        Belgium made similar approaches. The reactions of the countries concerned
                        were uniformly negative, although they were sympathetic to Belgian-U.S. aims
                        in the Congo.</p>
                    <p>The Department of State also instructed its representatives in Nigeria,
                        Ethiopia, Senegal, Liberia and the Malagasy Republic to make representations
                        to those governments encouraging affirmative responses to the Congolese
                        request for troops. Their responses were not completely unfavorable, but all
                        preferred that such assistance be made within the framework of multilateral
                        African action in the Congo. The provision of forces, however, was not
                        agreed at the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Conference at Addis Ababa
                        in early September.</p>

                        still being carried out. Four C–130 aircraft went to the Congo August 12 and
                        have since engaged in transporting Congolese troops, military supplies and
                        equipment, food and other relief equipment within the Congo. One C–130 was
                        withdrawn October 8. In addition, the United States has airlifted, as
                        necessary, equipment provided by Belgium to the Congo and Rwanda.</p>

                        assistance to African countries providing military assistance to the Congo
                        has not been acted upon since no African country presently provides such
                        aid. However, the five countries from which the Congo has requested military
                        assistance <pb n="434" facs="0467" xml:id="pg_434"/> have been informed that

                    <p>1595. Have just had 50 minute meeting with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> at residence. Told him I believed only frankness
                        should exist between us and my principal objective here was keep him
                        informed of my government’s thinking and ascertain at earliest possible
                        moment his government’s thinking whenever there was possibility of
                        misunderstanding. This having been said, I wanted read to him rather
                        brutally from two telegrams I had received from top officials of Department
                        of State. Then went through practically verbatim <gloss target="#t_Deptel_1">Deptel</gloss> 1017 and 1030<note n="2" xml:id="d299fn2"><ref target="#d295">Documents 295</ref> and <ref target="#d297">297</ref>.</note> omitting only some of strongest adjectives and
                        fuzzing first paragraph of <gloss target="#t_Deptel_1">Deptel</gloss> 1030.
                        (FYIs of course omitted.) <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        took it well. In going through 1017, he read carefully letter to President
                            <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> and I emphasized that this was
                        language prepared in Washington and not a word could be changed without
                        further consultation with me. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> said he understood. I drew his particular attention
                        to phraseology concerning strikes against cities, pointing out I recognized
                        this might cause him trouble, but this precise language had to be included.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> said he understood. He
                        said he would have messages typed up and would request that we forward them
                        to Geneva and Nairobi. Only point I did not emphasize, although I said it,
                        was that these letters must be published. I feel that this might well be
                        rubbing his nose in it too much, although I think they can be published once
                        they are issued. <gloss target="#t_Re_1">Re</gloss> S African T–6 unit, I
                        also hit hard on this point. Told him I personally understood pressure he
                        under from <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, but that now that
                        I believed we were <pb n="435" facs="0468" xml:id="pg_435"/>making major
                        step forward, he would have to do likewise. As I have not yet received
                        instructions through other channel, I had in all honesty fuzzed this point
                        and he and I agreed that I would notify him minute I had instructions and
                        that he would give orders to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                        to delay T–6 deployment <gloss target="#t_COQ_1">COQ</gloss> 24 hours.
                        Concerning our personal relations and frankness that must exist between our
                        2 governments, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> picked on
                        words “continuous close and confidential basis” in <gloss target="#t_Deptel_1">Deptel</gloss> 1030. He agreed that this must
                        govern all our dealings and promised do so. I pointed out to him that such
                        relationship would be mutually beneficial citing that Department had at my
                        request given way on two of major items, i.e. <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> presence Stanleyville and specific reference article 3.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> expressed gratitude and
                        I believe got point. Early in our conversation he apologized profusely for
                        not showing up yesterday blaming <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>’s loquaciousness and fact that any conversation
                        with <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> lasts at least two to
                        three hours. These conversations he said, exhaust him physically and
                        emotionally and he claims he under medical care last evening. I do not think
                        this absolute truth, but would hope that we will not once again experience
                        communications breakdown.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_Re_1">Re</gloss> Malila’s junket, I told him I did not
                        think this necessary, but he said that he so impressed with Secretary’s
                        recent message and President’s to <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> that the President and he agreed it essential they
                        be acknowledged by Special Emissary. He did not indicate that he expected
                        either President or Secretary receive Malila. In mentioning Secretary’s
                        message, he said it had been made helpful to him personally in his dealings
                        with <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and others, especially
                        the last sentence (<gloss target="#t_Deptel_1">Deptel</gloss> 982),<note n="3" xml:id="d299fn3">Dated October 18. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 1 THE

                        however, that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> challenged
                        Secretary’s “wholeheartedly continue” by stating that U.S. furnished
                        aircraft were on stand down. I cannot, of course, guarantee that all is now
                        well. Believe, however, that at least for moment the boil has been lanced.

                    <p>1. This memorandum is for the information of the Director of Central
                        Intelligence and is provided as background for the 29 October Special Group

                    <p>2. <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> activities in the Congo are
                        concentrated on (a) conducting air operations against rebel forces, (b)
                        creating a capability to rescue five U.S. officials [<hi rend="italic">less

                        of all American personnel held by the rebel regime in Stanleyville
                        (approximately 25) and (c) taking covert action to create a more stable
                        political situation in the Congo.</p>
                    <p>3. U.S. Personnel in Stanleyville:</p>
                    <p>A. Nineteen [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] have
                        been positioned in the Congo with the contingency mission of conducting a
                        clandestine rescue (by air, overland, or river) of the five Consulate
                        personnel. It will not have the capability to rescue the American missionary
                        personnel dispersed throughout the area.</p>
                    <p>B. The Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CINCSTRIKE_1">CINCSTRIKE</gloss> have been briefed on the
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> covert planning for Stanleyville
                        and have been advised that, should the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                        covert plan not be authorized by higher authority, <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> is prepared to permit its personnel and equipment to assist
                            <gloss target="#t_CINCSTRIKE_1">CINCSTRIKE</gloss> in support of its
                        larger effort. Leopoldville Station, including a <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> contingency planner, is working with four <gloss target="#t_CINCSTRIKE_1">CINCSTRIKE</gloss> planners on the possibility
                        of meshing the overt and covert plans.</p>
                    <p>C. <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> is prepared to lend covert support to
                        an effort by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Wayne Fredericks</persName> to contact Thomas Kansa,
                        the rebel foreign minister, although a recent report indicates he may be in
                        Stanleyville and in the bad graces of other rebel leaders. (State Department
                        wants this held very closely.)</p>
                    <p>D. A high priority effort continues to obtain all possible intelligence on
                        the status of Americans in Stanleyville and on the effective <pb n="438" facs="0471" xml:id="pg_438"/>control which the Stanleyville regime has
                        in the area. Numerous refugees from Stanleyville have been contacted and
                        debriefed and efforts continue to introduce clandestine agents into
                        Stanleyville.</p>
                    <p>4. The following actions continue in support of the Government of the Congo
                            (<gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>):</p>
                    <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Air military</hi>: There are now [<hi rend="italic">less
                            than 1 line not declassified</hi>] pilots in the Congo operating from
                        four bases (Lisala, Bukava, Kamina, and Leopoldville), and [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] non-American
                        ground maintenance personnel. The Congolese air force has been a major
                        factor in halting the rebel advance and in supporting Congolese National
                        Army operations. The support has been invaluable not only as a strike factor
                        but also psychologically. From 15 October to 23 October all operational
                        aircraft under U.S. control, including <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                        controlled T–28’s and B–26’s were grounded on orders of the State
                        Department. This order was given in reaction to intercepted rebel
                        communications which indicated that American lives would be endangered if
                        air strikes on non-military targets continued. Aircraft are now operating,
                        but under certain new restrictions imposed by the State Department
                        calculated to reduce the risk of retaliation against U.S. personnel held
                        hostage in Stanleyville and to create a better atmosphere for political
                        reconciliation. These restrictions confine air strikes to military targets
                        in non-urban areas, prevent flying within 25 miles of Stanleyville, prevent
                        B–26 strikes at intervals of less than 5 minutes after reconnaissance
                        flights, and prevent reconnaissance over urban areas at less than 3,000
                        feet.</p>
                    <p>The grounding order which revealed to certain Congolese commanders for the
                        first time that the combat aircraft was under U.S., not Congo, control
                        created considerable ill feeling between the Congolese military and the U.S.
                        and has greatly irritated <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        himself. One result of the grounding action may be that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> will make a greater effort to
                        prepare the mercenary operated “21st Air Squadron” for combat action. For
                        example, an unconfirmed report stated that on 25 October, T–6’s of the “21st
                        Squadron” attacked Boende city driving most of the populace into the
                        bush.</p>

                        the U.S. Missionary who reportedly was killed last week. By this time

                    <p>Yesterday (October 26) we learned from intercepts that Dr. Paul Carlson (who
                        had voluntarily remained in his mission in Yokama) is being held for trial
                        by a military tribunal in Stanleyville as “U.S. Major Paul Carson”. We have
                        asked the International Commission of the Red Cross to inform the
                        Stanleyville authorities that Dr. Carlson is not and never has been a U.S.

                    <p>I am concerned to learn that a decision has been reached to call off aerial
                        reconnaissance photography of Stanleyville. I understand that the military
                        were prepared to have photographs taken at a high altitude and at an angle
                        which would have kept the aircraft 25 miles from the outskirts of the city.
                        If weather conditions were satisfactory, only two runs would have been
                        necessary.</p>
                    <p>Under these circumstances, I agree with the country team that the risk is
                        minimal. The information is essential to deal with an emergency, should it
                        arise. I have felt strongly that our planning should be such that the
                        President could deal with any situation that arose in Stanleyville with
                        speed and effectiveness.</p>
                    <p>I have been told that the weather in November becomes worse and the
                        difficulty of getting satisfactory photographs will increase.</p>
                    <p>I recommend that the matter be reopened.</p>

                        Commander Stanleyville, has ordered rebel field commanders to arrest and
                        imprison all Belgians, Catholic priests and nuns, Protestants and Americans
                        and, in one case, all whites. If orders carried out, significant change in
                        situation would be to put other foreign nationals, principally Belgian, in

                    <p>1. This headquarters remains deeply concerned about the serious restrictions
                        which appear to have been placed on the conduct of military operations in
                        the Congo, and particularly with reference to the employment of air
                        power.</p>
                    <p>2. While it is most regrettable that five Americans and an unknown number of
                        other foreigners are in rebel custody in Stanleyville, this fact should not
                        be permitted to preclude proper conduct of military operations designed for
                        bringing the rebellion to an early end in the shortest time practicable. The
                        importance of air power in relation to the general undertaking is clearly
                        established in numerous reports received from the Congo.</p>
                    <p>3. Available information indicates that the rebels are apparently fully aware
                        of their success in countering air power by propaganda. If this continues,
                        the only outcome will be the weakening of the Congolese armed forces to the
                        extent that it is doubtful that they can win over the rebellious elements
                        anytime soon. In other words, this prospects a long drawn-out indecisive
                        undertaking which can lead to future complications that could not be even
                        estimated at this time, but none of them would be good.</p>
                    <p>4. Information available to me indicates that current policy provides
                        for:</p>
                    <p>A. No aviation of any kind is permitted to operate closer than 25 miles of
                        Stanleyville.</p>
                    <pb n="443" facs="0476" xml:id="pg_443"/>
                    <p>B. No combat target can be hit within a belt five miles wide, measured from
                        the outskirts, around any large or sensitive urban area, or within similar
                        belts two miles wide around any other urban area.</p>
                    <p>C. Combat missions conducted outside the prescribed belts around urban areas
                        are authorized, but are confined to strictly military targets such as troop
                        concentrations, military vehicles, military stores and supplies, highways
                        and bridges, guns and emplacements, fortified positions and roadblocks,
                        communications facilities and vessels being used for military purposes,
                        provided that such targets shall not be attacked where there is danger of
                        hitting significant numbers of noncombatants in the target area, such as
                        wives and children in military barracks area.</p>
                    <p>D. Air reconnaissance is authorized over urban areas and surrounding belts
                        provided plane maintains minimum altitude of three thousand feet and does
                        not open or return fire.</p>
                    <p>E. In the case of B–26’s, there must be a five-minute interval between any
                        combat run on targets outside the urban area and surrounding belt, and any
                        reconnaissance run within the area and belt.</p>
                    <p>5. Military objectives in the Congo primarily consist of towns and cities
                        held by the rebels, with very little combat taking place other than in and
                        around the towns. The policy now in effect permits the rebels to remain in
                        the towns unmolested, control the communication and supplies that exist in
                        the towns, and to have the comfort of urban facilities. Unless the
                        restrictions on the use of air power are lifted, and a return to the Geneva
                        Conventions adopted as a proper guideline, the rebels will have achieved a
                        significant victory. There is no question that this is the chief purpose for
                        which the rebel propaganda campaign is designed.</p>

                        sending of anti-<persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> letter. We
                        believe Getachew is already on right track in taking line (Nairobi’s 1126)
                        that proper next step for <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Commission is
                        to send “feeler mission” he describes to <gloss target="#t_Leo_1">Leo</gloss> and in opposing possible <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> efforts split <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>.

                        to establish satisfactory working relations between Commission and <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>, letter such as that proposed by
                            <persName corresp="#p_TBD_1">Telli</persName> would be even more
                        undesirable from this point of view.</p>
                    <p>There is an immediate additional task which would be highly appropriate for
                            <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> “feeler mission” to <gloss target="#t_Leo_1">Leo</gloss>. This is to work out with <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> measures for getting <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> personnel into Congo, including
                        rebel-held areas, in order carry out Red Cross traditional humanitarian

                        presence is strong reason for earliest possible despatch of “feeler mission”
                        to <gloss target="#t_Leo_1">Leo</gloss> and, in addition to importance this
                        consideration per se, would have advantage of helping get <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Commission off on relatively non-political

                    <p>We understand Tedessa’s doubts about wisdom of reviving Commission at this

                        along wrong track, best tactic would be to concentrate efforts on getting it
                        on right track rather than (probably fruitlessly) resisting its

                        While most important elements in getting <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Commission on right track are to avoid anti-<persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> letter to <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> or <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> mission to <gloss target="#t_Leo_1">Leo</gloss> charged
                        with splitting <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, there is also question
                        of composition any “feeler mission” to <gloss target="#t_Leo_1">Leo</gloss>.
                        While Getachew’s comments on this point (Nairobi’s 1120)<note n="5" xml:id="d307fn5">Dated October 30. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 23–9 THE
                            CONGO)</note> interesting, some aspects not entirely clear to us.
                        Difficult judge best composition from this distance but we somewhat
                        surprised at Getachew’s judgment that Koinange–Mathu mission could be
                        “disastrous” and that <persName corresp="#p_KJO_1">Kenyatta</persName>
                        should send <persName corresp="#p_MJO_1">Murumbi</persName>. We note in last
                        sentence Nairobi’s 1126 that <persName corresp="#p_MJO_1">Murumbi</persName>’s present position is that “<persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> must go” so, despite his ability and background, he
                        may not be improvement from point of view attitude towards <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. In view of <persName corresp="#p_KJO_1">Kenyatta</persName>’s apparently deepseated prejudice
                        against <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, seems likely any
                        Kenyan sent by <persName corresp="#p_KJO_1">Kenyatta</persName> might well
                        go <gloss target="#t_Leo_1">Leo</gloss> with at least informal instructions
                        work in direction of trying drive wedge between <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. We can see difficulty in sending Mathu in view of his
                        past clashes with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> in Katanga
                        but we not clear why Koinange significantly worse than others. If feasible
                        we can see advantage of formula including non-Kenyan like Getachew along
                        with intelligent trusted Kenyan, like Mungai or Njonjo. Most important other
                        element, of course, is that member or members of “feeler mission” be
                        acceptable to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. We question
                        desirability of including African Ambs Leo in mission as this would bring in
                        unacceptable elements (e.g. Ghana). Recognize we will have limited influence
                        on composition of mission but would appreciate comments both Nairobi and
                        Leo.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> as being “of only
                        limited utility”.<note n="2" xml:id="d308fn2"><persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BWH_1">Brubeck</persName>,
                            and <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> met with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> in Leopoldville on October
                            28.</note> On the plus side, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> agreed to dismiss all South African and Rhodesian
                        pilots; to publish his letters to the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>
                        and <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss>; to issue orders to Congolese
                        military commanders not to call for air strikes against towns; and to invite
                        the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Commission to visit Leopoldville.
                        On the negative side, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> proved
                        adamant against negotiating with the rebels for a political solution and
                        against broadening the political base of his present government.</p>
                    <p>2. At Brussels, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName>
                        found that there were differing views between <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> and the Foreign Office on how to handle <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d308fn3">See
                                <ref target="#d300fn2">footnote 2, Document 300</ref>.</note> The
                        Foreign Office argued against pushing <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> too far, for fear of pushing him into the hands of
                        the South Africans and the Portuguese. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName>, on the other hand, questioned whether <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> has any alternative other than to
                        continue to rely on Belgium and the US over the long term. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> reportedly favors a hard line with
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and fears that, unless
                        he is controlled now, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> will
                        develop an authoritarian regime (a view shared by <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName>). The Foreign Office favors letting
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> achieve a quick military
                        victory, followed by a broadening of the government which, argues the
                        Foreign Office, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> would
                        recognize as a necessary step in the interests of his own political
                        survival.</p>
                    <p>3. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> also discussed
                        the difference of opinion between himself and Mac <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> on how better to safeguard the
                        Americans at Stanleyville. Mac strongly advocates keeping the pressure on
                        the rebels. <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> fears that the
                        closer the Congolese forces get to Stanleyville, the greater will be the
                        danger to the hostages. He recognizes, however, that a continued adamant
                        stand by <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> against a
                        negotiated <pb n="448" facs="0481" xml:id="pg_448"/> political settlement,
                        coupled with a military slowdown, could have dangerous consequences.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> gave no clues about what
                        recommendations or suggestions he would make as the result of his trip
                        (although he had spent the preceding hour with George <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName>).</p>

                    <p>1. The reference message was retransmitted this date to the Joint Chiefs of
                        Staff by USSTRICOM. This is the second occasion on which we have had
                        background information pertaining to some planning or proposals relating to
                        the transport of Belgian paratroopers in US aircraft to participate in an
                        air assault on Stanleyville.</p>
                    <p>2. While the matter of transporting a given number of people from Belgium to
                        the Congo is no particular problem, the complications of conducting an
                        airborne assault with foreign troops is a matter that should receive the
                        most careful consideration before being undertaken. The Belgians do not have
                        the same loading and jumping techniques as do US forces, and a language and
                        communication problem would exist. The problems of staging a coordinated
                        joint air assault would be most complicated without some preliminary
                        training. This would likely consume as much time as is now programmed for
                        the <persName corresp="#p_VCF_1">Van der Walle</persName> plan to be
                        completed.</p>
                    <p>3. If any planning or proposals of this nature are being made with any
                        measure of seriousness, I earnestly recommend that experts of this <pb n="449" facs="0482" xml:id="pg_449"/>command be called upon to

                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> opened the
                        discussion after dinner by pointing out that we felt that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> should be induced to make some gesture as a
                        contribution to the security of foreigners in Stanleyville and to improve
                        relations with other African countries. Since, as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> had earlier pointed out, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> had recently made a statement
                        which was not helpful, being somewhat too belligerent in tone, he would like
                        to have Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName>’s further thinking
                        on what should now be done.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> replied that the military
                        situation was better and if it were not for the hostages in Stanleyville, he
                        would say let the military situation take its normal course. However, we do
                        not know what may happen to our nationals if the rebels lose their heads
                        completely. In Leopoldville the problem is not with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> himself but lies in the fact that
                        a number of people have influence upon him, such as <persName corresp="#p_MGO_1">Munongo</persName>, as well as a number of Belgians
                        who do not fall under the Belgian director of technical assistance. They are
                        former friends of his from the Katanga and they do not always give him the
                        best of advice.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> went on to say that after
                        Kindu a few days will be needed to consolidate the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> forces. He knew that <persName corresp="#p_GCH_1">Gbenye</persName> had been telegraphing messages in all directions to
                        the effect that the Americans and Belgians are bombing civilians, but as far
                        as he knew there have been no air attacks on towns except very limited
                        action on Boende. <persName corresp="#p_GCH_1">Gbenye</persName>’s messages
                        show that he is losing his head completely.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> concurred that we should
                        take advantage of the breathing spell after the taking of Kindu. He had read
                        the text of the proposed declaration and felt that it should be made by
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> rather than <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> since the former enjoyed better
                        standing with the Africans; however, it would be better to have it made by
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> than to have no
                        statement at all. After first reading the text he thought it was well put
                        together and met the requirements of the situation. He had one comment.
                        There was a sentence on page 3 which we would never get <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> to accept. This was the sentence
                        about sending <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> personnel to observe the
                        elections. However, the most important thing was to get <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> personally to make the
                        declaration. Perhaps both embassies in Leopoldville could jointly try to
                        “sell” this to <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>.</p>
                    <p>In view of the enormous importance of this text Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> wondered whether its delivery to
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> should perhaps be
                        entrusted to someone special other than our Ambassadors (there was at
                        present no Belgian Ambassador in Leopoldville). Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> asked him if he had anyone
                        particular in mind and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName>
                        indicated he would <pb n="455" facs="0488" xml:id="pg_455"/>prefer that
                        person to be an American. The Governor pointed out that we would prefer that
                        special person to be a Belgian. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> stressed that it was not a refusal on his part to
                        assume such a responsibility, rather the question was who was in a position
                        to influence <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and he didn’t
                        know the answer to that question. It developed that Mr. Van Bilsen, Director
                        of Belgian technical assistance in the Congo, who had been <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>’s adviser in earlier days, was
                        the person Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> had in mind. It
                        was agreed that Mr. Van Bilsen, who is now in Brussels, would be contacted
                        by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> upon the latter’s
                        return to Brussels on November 10.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the military situation Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> said that the Van Der Walle column in Kindu would
                        be reinforced as soon as possible so that it could then be decided whether
                        it would launch an attack against Stanleyville. He understood that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> thought a direct attack
                        would be better if it were not for the hostages whose security was a
                        paramount consideration.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> pointed out that for an
                        attack on Stanleyville timing was very important because of the 800
                        Europeans there, some 30 of whom were Americans and about 500 Belgians.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> knows that he must have
                        Belgian-U.S. agreement before he makes an attack. The question was whether
                        one should keep pressure against the rebels or not since experience shows
                        that when the rebels are under pressure generally they do not mistreat
                        foreigners but tend to be rough when things are going well for them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> said that Van Der Walle
                        knew he must make no move against Stanleyville without warning us first.
                        However, we have very little control over the column approaching
                        Stanleyville from Boende, as this column is led by South African
                        mercenaries. We must confirm to Van Der Walle that he can make no move on
                        Stanleyville without letting us know. The distance of 250 miles that
                        separates Kindu from Stanleyville is a very important factor because as the
                            <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> troops advance <persName corresp="#p_GCH_1">Gbenye</persName> may lose control over the rebels
                        who may panic and lose their heads completely. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> stated very strongly that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> must be told emphatically that he
                        can make no move against Stanleyville without prior notification. To a
                        question about safety of the hostages in Stanleyville, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> replied that the danger in
                        Stanleyville was not so much from <persName corresp="#p_GCH_1">Gbenye</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_SGE_1">Soumialot</persName>
                        personally but rather that they might lose control over the forces they had
                        unleashed. It could well be that <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> troops
                        advancing against Stanleyville would create general panic over which rebel
                        leaders would have no control. He had thought of recalling Van Der Walle to
                        Brussels for consultation and for an appraisal of the Stanleyville
                        situation. So far we had been extremely fortunate <pb n="456" facs="0489" xml:id="pg_456"/> in Albertville, Uvira and Kindu. The action had been
                        so fast the rebels had not had time to kill hostages.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWH_1">Brubeck</persName> suggested that we find
                        out Van Der Walle’s estimates of the value of an air strike on Stanleyville
                        using blank ammunition at the time of his column’s land attack on the
                        town.</p>
                    <p>Returning to his thought of recalling Van Der Walle to Brussels for
                        consultation, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> expressed
                        his uncertainty over this idea, as well as his feeling that the operation
                        against Stanleyville must be a lightning fast strike.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_DVE_1">Davignon</persName> suggested that the Belgians
                        send their military attaché to talk to Van Der Walle, after which he would
                        come to Brussels to make his report. <persName corresp="#p_DVE_1">Davignon</persName> commented that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> dislikes Van Bilsen and that Rothschild could
                        conceivably accompany Van Bilsen when he calls on <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. This could be considered a normal
                        step because both have responsibilities for technical assistance.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> indicated he might suggest
                        that Rothschild accompany Van Bilsen. He went on to say that we should tell
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> that we are always
                        ready to help technically and militarily but that the proposed declaration
                        was an essential preliminary to the military operation and needed to create
                        doubt in the minds of the rebels. Monmart (Belgian Military Attaché in the
                        Congo) would be sent to Kindu to see Van Der Walle to explain to him that if
                        he moves on Stanleyville it must be a lightning fast strike because delays
                        can have very grave consequences. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> believed that we had time for such consultation since
                        Van Der Walle will require a few days to reorganize his forces.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> said that we
                        welcomed these Belgian initiatives.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> also indicated that another
                        danger was that in Leopoldville there were people who were not greatly
                        concerned over the fate of the 800 Europeans. <persName corresp="#p_MGO_1">Munongo</persName> was one who advocated a policy of brute force. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> thought that the U.S. and
                        Belgium should hold fast and tell <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> that the declaration must be made.</p>
                    <p>After summing up the procedures outlined above Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> indicated that there were other
                        things that could also be done by the Congo Government, such as sending some
                        emissaries to other African countries on explanatory missions.</p>
                    <p>Returning to the questions of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> was assured by <persName corresp="#p_DVE_1">Davignon</persName> that Montmart in previous talks with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> had gained <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s acceptance of the idea that no
                        operations against Stanleyville would be undertaken without letting us know.
                        Montmart had also talked with <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                        and <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>. They as well as
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> agreed that the military
                        must proceed to Stanleyville but they fully appreciate the problem that we
                        (U.S. and Belgium) are faced with.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> suggested getting
                        the Nigerians to support the idea of a <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> declaration. <persName corresp="#p_DVE_1">Davignon</persName> suggested the Ethiopians in addition. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, he asserted, respects the
                        Ethiopians who helped him at Addis Ababa. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWH_1">Brubeck</persName> suggested that in addition to the Nigerians, the
                        Tunisians and the Ethiopians be asked to recommend to <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> that he make the proposed
                        declaration. <persName corresp="#p_DVE_1">Davignon</persName> pointed out
                        that Arab countries such as Tunisia are out as far as <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> is concerned. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> agreed that Tunisia should not be
                        approached but that the Nigerians and Ethiopians should be urged to tell
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> that it is essential he
                        make such a declaration.</p>
                    <p>On the question of individuals to be sent by the Congo Government as
                        emissaries to other African countries, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> thought it was all right to send Langema as he was on
                        good terms with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and had
                        performed missions for <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        before, but we should guard against being too specific about whom we should
                        like to have sent and merely point out in general terms that we feel such
                        missions would be most useful. For example, if we should mention <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Nendaka</persName>,
                        and <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> might object.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fredericks</persName> suggested getting the
                        Zambians to play a part also.</p>

                    <p>The mercenary (<persName corresp="#p_VCF_1">Van der Walle</persName>) column
                        that took Kindu last week is preparing for final attack on Stanleyville in
                        two to three weeks. Meanwhile the situation of foreigners in Stanleyville
                        (five official and 20 unofficial Americans, 6–800 Europeans) is increasingly
                        precarious. All Belgians and Americans are now under house arrest and
                        labeled “prisoners of war.” At any time during these next several weeks, as
                        the situation in Stanleyville deteriorates, the rebel “Jeunesse” may get out
                        of control and start killing Europeans. The danger will be particularly <pb n="458" facs="0491" xml:id="pg_458"/>acute at the actual time of
                            <persName corresp="#p_VCF_1">Van der Walle</persName>’s attack on
                        Stanleyville (at Kindu last week 80 Europeans were nearly killed by rebels
                        when <persName corresp="#p_VCF_1">Van der Walle</persName> took the

                    <p>In talks on Sunday<note n="2" xml:id="d314fn2">November 8; see <ref target="#d313">Document 313</ref>.</note> to meet this problem,
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> arrived at the following
                        tentative agreement (<persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> asks
                        great secrecy because this is politically very touchy in Belgium):</p>
                    <p>1. Belgian paratroop force (probably company size) should be on standby alert
                        in Brussels with a corresponding US C–130 transport force on alert in Europe
                        ready to go into Stanleyville on a few hours notice and seize the town long
                        enough to evacuate by air all Europeans. Belgians will obtain pro forma
                        request for evacuation mission from Congo Government.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> will tomorrow (Tuesday)
                        attempt to secure Cabinet approval for this project. We will then send a
                        single, high ranking military officer in civilian clothes to Brussels to
                        work out air transport requirements with the Belgians and then implement
                        (probably half a dozen C–130s at most, for troop transport and evacuation).
                        This to be handled on strictest need-to-know basis.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendations:</p>
                    <p>1. That the President approve this project with the specific understanding
                        that any actual use of the force would require decision by both governments
                        in the particular case.</p>
                    <p>2. That Secretary McNamara designate a responsible official in Defense with

                    <p>Last week <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s Belgian-led
                            (<persName corresp="#p_VCF_1">Van der Walle</persName>) mercenary force
                        took Kindu, the most important rebel city short of Stanleyville. Within two
                        or three weeks it will take Stanleyville, 250 miles away, and the present
                        rebellion will be ended.</p>
                    <p>Our biggest immediate problem is how to protect the foreign hostages in
                        Stanleyville (5 official and 20 unofficial Americans, 6–800 Europeans) both
                        during this several weeks and when the mercenaries attack. We have gotten
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to agree and to announce
                        publicly that his airplanes will not hit towns, in order to minimize the
                        risk that the rebels will kill the Stanleyville hostages in retaliation for
                        air attacks. However, the hostages are in acute danger—first, because there
                        is a squadron of T–6 aircraft, flown by mercenaries, which we do not control
                        and which is a real threat to attack Stanleyville in the next several weeks;
                        second, because the rebels may well slaughter hostages at the time <persName corresp="#p_VCF_1">Van der Walle</persName> actually attacks
                        Stanleyville.</p>
                    <p>The military move on Stanleyville is a calculated risk and a real one. To
                        minimize it, we are trying to compel <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to withdraw the mercenary T–6s and may need a tough
                        Presidential message to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> for
                        this purpose. We are working with the Belgians on a contingency plan to drop
                        Belgian paratroops in Stanleyville on short notice, to evacuate foreigners,
                        if the situation gets out of control. And we are working with the Belgians
                        on a program of political pressures and covert negotiations to try to get
                        the rebels to capitulate and surrender Stanleyville without a fight.
                        Realistically, however, this will be a dangerous two or three weeks, it will
                        probably end in the military conquest of Stanleyville, and there is a real
                        chance that some Americans and Europeans will be killed.</p>
                    <p>Looking beyond the immediate military problem and the problem of our
                        hostages, our aim is to avoid the US again being involved so deeply in the
                        Congo. We are trying to get the other Africans to take over the Congo
                        problem politically; we are trying to get the Belgians to take
                        responsibility, with the US limited to a supporting role, in helping <pb n="460" facs="0493" xml:id="pg_460"/>the Congo; we want to withdraw our
                        military assistance and leave it to the Belgians; we want to pressure
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to make a sensible
                        political compromise among the forces in the Congo, and not get stuck
                        propping up <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> in an
                        authoritarian regime without any power base in the realities of the
                        Congo.</p>

                    <p>1182. Following are agreements reached on Congo with Belgians during
                        discussions Washington November 6–9:</p>
                    <p>1. Two American officials, one of them military, and a Belgian diplomat will
                        be sent from the Embassies in Leopoldville to Kindu (a) to consult with the
                        military operations commander to elicit his opinions on the time to begin
                        and the time required to carry out the operation against Stanleyville and to
                        determine more precisely the logistical support requirements of the columns,
                        and (b) to survey the situation to assemble information which would be
                        helpful in determining the composition and functions of an equipe
                        polyvalente for Kindu.</p>
                    <p>2. The Belgian Government will form an equipe polyvalente for Kindu in the
                        shortest possible time.</p>
                    <p>3. In consideration of the large foreign community in Stanleyville, the two
                        governments will emphasize to the Congolese Government the necessity of
                        consultations with the two governments before an operation against
                        Stanleyville is undertaken.</p>
                    <p>4. The United States Government will supplement existing air transport in the
                        Congo to provide adequate airlift capability to supply the columns of the
                        military operations commander at Kindu. The rapid supplying of these forces
                        is intended to create as soon as possible a situation in which a decision on
                        his further advance can be taken. The supplying does not prejudge that

                        essential elements of the Rothschild Plan. The United States Government will
                        fully support these efforts. In instituting the Plan, the Belgian Government
                        will as far as possible work closely with the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> chief of civil operations in the Congo to assure maximum

                        will endeavor to obtain non-military personnel for these crews on the basis

                    <p>I know that you are fully aware of the deep concern which is felt at the
                        highest levels of the Government with the safety of the American community
                        at Stanleyville. Both <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> and I
                        are strongly convinced that the proposed program will, if accepted and
                        vigorously implemented by <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>
                        and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, undercut the morale and
                        disrupt the unity of the insurgents, enhance the possibility of a peaceful
                        resolution of the Stanleyville problem and at the same time contribute to a
                        better atmosphere in which to undertake the gigantic tasks of reconstruction
                        and reconciliation which face the Congo.</p>
                    <p>We realize that with the military effort moving so satisfactorily, there may
                        be a reluctance on the part of the Congo’s top leaders to temporize, however
                        marginally, with the rebels. I know that you will make every effort,
                        however, to overcome any such hesitancy, emphasizing the minimal nature of
                        the government offers which are contemplated and the fact that they are
                        intended to supplement and not supplant the continuance of a sustained
                        military effort. While it is not our present intention to threaten or apply
                        specific pressures on the <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> in order to
                        encourage acceptance of this program, you should not hesitate to make clear
                        as necessary that our attitude towards future cooperation with the Congo
                        will inevitably be affected by <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>’s and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s cooperation on a matter of such fundamental

                    </list>
                    <p>Belgian and US military yesterday completed a contingency plan under which 12
                        US C–130s would fly battalion (545) of Belgian paratroops from Brussels to
                        Stanleyville via Spain, Ascencion and Kamina <pb n="466" facs="0499" xml:id="pg_466"/>(in Katanga) to seize city and evacuate foreigners (600
                        Belgians, 200 other Europeans, 30 American). Plan calls for 12 hour warning
                        to alert Belgian paras, departure from Belgium at 1840Z any given day, then
                        following schedule:</p>
                    <p>Minimum lead time—</p>
                    <p>Brussels–Stanleyville—57 hrs. 30 mins.</p>
                    <p>Ascencion–Stanleyville—22 hrs. 30 mins.</p>
                    <p>Kamina–Stanleyville—3 hrs.</p>
                    <p>Plan would be used a) if violence began in Stan during next 10–15 days before
                        Congo mercenary (<persName corresp="#p_VCF_1">Van der Walle</persName>)
                        force can attack, or b) simultaneous with <persName corresp="#p_VCF_1">Van
                            der Walle</persName> attack in order maximize chance of securing
                        Europeans rapidly so as to prevent reprisal. Such a US-flown Belgian
                        paratroop assault on Stan would cost us heavily in African politics
                        (including Chirep, base rights, etc.), is contemplated only because neither
                        we nor Belgians could afford to stand helplessly enduring slaughter of
                        foreigners in Stan.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_VCF_1">Van der Walle</persName> now plans tentatively
                        to begin move toward Stan about 17th, final (150 mile straight good road)
                        dash to begin 24th and arrive Stan 25th. This schedule may slip several
                        days. Once it becomes visible moving on Stan, situation there will be very
                        dangerous for hostages, particularly 5 US diplomatic personnel believed in
                        military prison.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> thinks (<persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WEG_1">Wheeler</persName> concur) that this is primarily Belgian
                        responsibility and Belgian stake, with acute Belgian political consequences
                        for <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName>, difficult for us to
                        refuse or second guess him. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName>
                        has asked immediate US agreement to launch force Brussels 17th, holding at
                        Ascencion on 18th, with lead time of 22 hours Ascencion to Stan via Kamina
                        if decision made to go. (Obviously, in situation contemplated, lead time may
                        be critical.) We have replied that while disposed to meet his request, would
                        like his comment on several questions (what kind of cover story to maintain
                        security; why not preposition at Kamina instead of Ascencion, with only 4
                        hours lead time to Stan; why not delay departure from Belgium several days
                        in order to limit period of preposition to shorter, critically important
                        period thus minimizing security risk) but we will probably have to make a
                        decision tomorrow.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">The President may therefore be asked tomorrow</hi> for a
                        firm decision to move to a preposition base (Kamina or Ascencion) = still

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Addendum—(misc. points and info)</p>
                    <p>1. With Spanish and French overflight clearances required, local personnel at
                        air bases en route and at Kamina and conspicuous absence <pb n="467" facs="0500" xml:id="pg_467"/>of paratroop battalion from Brussels,
                        likelihood of security leak very great.</p>
                    <p>2. With a security leak, or if Stanleyville actually hit, political
                        repercussions in Africa hard to over emphasize (political contingency
                        planning is underway).</p>
                    <p>3. If we hit Stanleyville, there is increased danger of reprisal against
                        additional foreigners (perhaps 30 Americans, several hundred Belgians)
                        scattered throughout Northeast Congo as well as (less probably) attacks on
                        US Embassies and nationals in other African countries (problems under
                        study).</p>
                    <p>4. Existence and movement of this force will generate heavy Belgian and
                        Embassy <gloss target="#t_Leo_1">Leo</gloss> pressures to use, particularly
                        at time when <persName corresp="#p_VCF_1">Van der Walle</persName> reaches
                        Stanleyville.</p>
                    <p>5. We continue to seek better alternatives including these political moves
                        aimed at collapse of Stanleyville without violence:</p>
                    <p>a. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> has agreed to help
                        persuade <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> to issue
                        “reconciliation manifesto” offering amnesty, participation in elections,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>b. We have sent [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] to
                        East Africa to explore with rebel contact there possibility of a deal with
                        the rebel leaders (money and safe conduct to exile).</p>
                    <p>But these are faint hopes, and a <persName corresp="#p_VCF_1">Van der
                            Walle</persName> military conquest of Stanleyville in next two weeks is
                        most likely prospect with very real chance US-Belgian intervention will be
                        needed to rescue hostages.</p>

                        paratroopers at British Ascension Island in the South Atlantic, 22 hours
                        from Stanleyville?</p>

                    <p>3. The situation: Mercenary advance on Stanleyville begins tomorrow and
                        should drive rebels out within 3 or 4 days. In this period the safety of 30
                        Americans and 800 other foreigners, mostly Belgian, will be endangered.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> and Prime Minister LeFevre
                        wish to reduce our reaction time from three days to one.</p>
                    <p>4. As we agreed at the Ranch, it seems best to let Belgians take the lead on
                        this and to be guided by their judgment. They know the Congolese better, and
                        their nationals outnumber ours by 30 to 1. Nevertheless, it is our officials
                        who have been directly threatened, and all the transport will be U.S. Air
                        Force. So it is an important decision.</p>
                    <p>5. We can still hope that the rescue operation will not be necessary, because
                        any action of this kind will have real political costs in the <pb n="470" facs="0503" xml:id="pg_470"/>Congo and may involve the death of innocent
                        Americans by panicky rebel reaction. Nevertheless, the possible cost of
                        opposing the Belgian recommendation seems clearly greater than the cost of
                        concurrence.</p>
                    <p>6. The requirement for your consent to further movement of this force will
                        remain. It is probable that the next recommendation will be to move the
                        paratroops to Kamina in the Katanga Province of the Congo. This will put
                        them only 4 hours from Stanleyville, and while it increases risk of rebel
                        panic, it will also increase the warning signal that we are ready to act if
                        necessary. This decision may come tomorrow, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> will bring it to you directly if
                        necessary.</p>

                    <p>1. With reference to General Lemnitzer’s telegram of November 15 to
                        Ambassador MacArthur regarding the Dragon Rouge operation,<note n="2" xml:id="d323fn2">Not found.</note> the Department of State:</p>
                    <p>A. Considers Dragon Rouge to be a Belgian operation with U.S. logistical
                        support; and</p>
                    <p>B. Agrees that if and when the necessary joint US/GOB decision to implement
                        the plan has been made, the military commander responsible for making the
                        “go/no-go” and timing decisions from Kamina onward should be the Belgian
                        paratroop commander.</p>
                    <p>2. The plan now provides that, following completion of the mission and
                        refueling and crew rest at Leopoldville, the 12 C–130’s “will prepare to
                        return to home station via Wheelus”. As was the case with the movement to
                        Stanleyville, overriding political considerations make the use of Wheelus
                        for the return trip impossible. The plan should be <pb n="471" facs="0504" xml:id="pg_471"/>amended to provide for return without overflying
                        African countries, none of whom would be likely to grant overflight
                        clearances even if we were prepared to request them. The most direct
                        politically acceptable route would be the one used by the C–130’s for the
                        flight from Brussels to Stanleyville, i.e. via Ascension and Las Palmas to
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>3. The plan makes no provision for the evacuation of Belgian paratroopers
                        from Stanleyville after completion of the mission. We are asking the
                        American Embassy in Brussels to ascertain Belgian intentions in this
                        regard.</p>

                            their arms, accept his government’s guarantees of amnesty, and join in
                            constructing a great nation in peace and order. (Ibid.)</note> as
                        subsequently modified. He very polite but extremely firm in his negative
                        attitude. He said he had already made appeal to rebels. His own population
                        dead-set against forgiveness due wanton destruction life within rebel areas.
                        If he were to make appeal it would be misconstrued here as weakness and
                        would thus weaken his own position and that of his govt. Furthermore
                        futility of such appeal should be obvious in that rebels allege “I do not
                        exist.” He also worried regarding non-Congolese in that rebels would
                        interpret his appeal as sign of success of their hostage policy and that
                        they were on way to international recognition and eventually negotiation
                        with central govt thanks to their policy <pb n="472" facs="0505" xml:id="pg_472"/>of cruelty and reprisals. Therefore, it essential that
                        military action move ahead as fast as possible.</p>
                    <p>When De <persName corresp="#p_KCD_1">Kerchove</persName> mentioned Katangan
                        precedent, <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> said that
                        situation today totally different in that Katangans recognized they were in
                        succession from central govt. Thus they recognized <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> as head of central govt. Rebels,
                        however, do not recognize <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>
                        as head of central govt and are making every effort take over govt and
                        destroy <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>. De <persName corresp="#p_KCD_1">Kerchove</persName> then said that while <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> looking at this purely from
                        internal Congolese point of view, Belgium and other friendly govts were
                        concerned with international ramifications of situation. Belg Govt
                        representing Belgian people, wants maintain <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>’s international position and peaceful image that he
                        now has in minds of all Belgians. Belgians like peaceful people and if he
                        acquired image of someone who can resort only to arms, it will not improve
                        his standing throughout world. <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> made no substantive comment. De <persName corresp="#p_KCD_1">Kerchove</persName> then referred to Congo’s
                        loneliness in African family and bespoke necessity having recourse to <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> said that he had done everything possible to get
                            <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> here and had recently heard from
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJO_1">Kenyatta</persName> who inquired whether
                            <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> would have liberty of movement
                        here. <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> said he had informed
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJO_1">Kenyatta</persName> that Commission
                        certainly would have complete liberty of movement, but he could not
                        guarantee whether they could get into Stan because unfortunately he did not
                        control that city today. <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>
                        reiterated that he thought there nothing more he could do in <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> domain.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> repeated he
                        would not make any statement. He said, however, he would discuss matter
                        further with PriMin and would of course let De <persName corresp="#p_KCD_1">Kerchove</persName> know results. He implied, however, that anyone who
                        makes such statement would be endangering his position here and De <persName corresp="#p_KCD_1">Kerchove</persName> got impression that he would
                        advise <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> against such action.
                        I asked De <persName corresp="#p_KCD_1">Kerchove</persName> whether he had
                        associated <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> with his démarche and
                        whether he thought there anything I could do at this time. De <persName corresp="#p_KCD_1">Kerchove</persName> said that he told <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> several times that draft had been
                        prepared by our two govts but that as Belgium had largest human stake Stan,
                        it had been agreed that he should make first démarche. He repeatedly
                        referred in his conversation to the 5 official Americans Stan and to the
                        presence of American, as well as other, missionaries in rebel territory. As
                        for my seeing <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> this
                        afternoon, De <persName corresp="#p_KCD_1">Kerchove</persName> personal
                        opinion is that it would be waste of time for <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> knows that we feel as strongly as Belgium does on
                        this issue.</p>
                    <p>Finally De <persName corresp="#p_KCD_1">Kerchove</persName> said that he
                        mentioned to <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> what he
                        understood to be <gloss target="#t_VDW_1">VDW</gloss>’s timetable for
                        recapture Stan for he used timetable as means to emphasize urgency of
                        statement.</p>
                    <pb n="473" facs="0506" xml:id="pg_473"/>
                    <p>Notwithstanding apparent futility of such action, am seeking meeting with
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>. Am asking it on urgent
                        basis but I personally would hope it would occur only after <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> has discussed this action with
                        Pres which I believe will occur this afternoon. Meanwhile, De <persName corresp="#p_KCD_1">Kerchove</persName> and I are coordinating our backup

                    <p>1013. Subject: Dragon Rouge. We assured by Col Dunn that Belgian assault
                        forces will give priority attention rescuing five official Americans
                        Stanleyville, who Belgians aware are in greater danger than other foreign
                        nationals. We understand also that Belgian assault force includes some
                        personnel who familiar with Stanleyville area and possibly even some who
                        speak local native languages. We consider both high priority requirements
                        since ability find out where Americans are and disposition get to them
                        quickly may well be life-or-death matter. As opportunities arise in
                        discussion Dragon Rouge, you should make clear importance we attach to these
                        two points.</p>
                    <p>In further effort along these lines, we sending <persName corresp="#p_CJR_1">Clingerman</persName>, former Stanleyville consul, to Brussels tonight
                        (arriving 1100 PanAm 108, Nov 17). His mission in Brussels will be to
                        consult with Belgians in order assist in planning specific measures to be
                        taken to rescue Americans. If as we assume Belgians have no objection, he
                        will then accompany Belgian forces from Brussels to Ascension and, if
                        decision taken to execute Dragon Rouge, on to but not beyond Kamina. He will
                        have all info re location Americans Stan available to us and be authorized
                        function in general capacity of political liaison and adviser to Dragon

                    <p>McNamara: It’ll be dangerous if the paradrop is carried out, but it’ll be
                        dangerous if it isn’t and under the circumstances, the danger of carrying it
                        out is less than the danger of not carrying it out.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: Well now you’ve got this
                        feedback all over town, I think from the same source that claims that every
                        man in State is against it. Oh hell, the Secretary came in and from
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> down to the bottom one,
                        they thought it [unintelligible], everybody thought it was terrible.</p>
                    <p>McNamara: Well I thought—</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: And that <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> came in and said that he rather
                        thought it ought to be done and that everybody around the table—but they’re
                        going around town peddling this kind of stuff. I just had a fellow come into
                        me. I haven’t called anyone else. The next man I’m going to call is
                            <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName>, but I’m not going to tell
                        him I’ve discussed it with folks, but I don’t like for him to be
                        [unintelligible].</p>
                    <p>McNamara: I don’t think it’s fair to do that, Mr. President, because I am
                        just positive that <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> was in
                        favor of this. At least he led me to believe he was and <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName>’s taken a pretty firm line on the
                        Congo situation. For example, it was he over the objections of another group
                        at State who pressed for a reconnaissance plane to fly over Stanleyville or
                        at least ten or fifteen miles off the center of Stanleyville so we could get
                        back photographs of the area, and this because we said if they wanted a U.S.
                        military operation over there we couldn’t possibly carry it out unless we
                        had some photographs of the area and knew what we were dropping into or knew
                        what we were sending troops into. So much over the objections of others at
                        State, <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> strongly urged that
                        this be done and Dean approved it, which we did. I think this is only to
                        illustrate that he’s been a very firm individual and it was my understanding
                        that this Belgian paradrop operation evolved out of his talks in Belgium,
                        although it didn’t come up at that particular time. It came about as a
                        result of his conversations and if <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> was in favor of it, and therefore from my point of
                        view, State was proposing it and we went along with it because I valued
                        Dean’s judgment on this issue. Dean has been very much concerned about the
                        lives of the Americans in Stanleyville and his—his—.</p>
                    <pb n="479" facs="0512" xml:id="pg_479"/>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: I think we’ve got to be. I
                        think that flag’s got to go to that person, and we’ve got to stand up and
                        not let the Afro-Asians run over us. And I just took that position when
                        these folks talked to me about it, and I said I’m just damn tired of a bunch
                        of folks like this, and they’ve got a right to kill American people and we
                        haven’t even got a right to furnish a plane to try to get them out and so
                        forth. But the State Department group is putting out some bad stuff and
                        their thing that’s coming to my desk is that all of them are against this
                        from <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> down except <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName>, and he came into me late and they
                        ran under the table but—.</p>
                    <p>McNamara: Well <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> is definitely in
                        favor of this. There’s no doubt about that, but I’m perfectly willing to
                        stand with him and be known as being in favor of it in the press. I know
                        he’s very much concerned about the lives of these people. He has proposed
                        policies that I would not have proposed in order to save their lives.
                        [gap]—but in any case that was his proposal and I supported him on it. And I
                        think this only indicates that he’s taken a damn firm hard line in trying to
                        preserve the lives of these people and he strongly believes that this
                        paradrop will act in the course of that objective and I’m strongly in favor
                        of supporting him therefore.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: Now when you—, when it’s
                        leaked though and they have advance notice, does that change—</p>
                    <p>McNamara: Well I noticed the leaks and I saw some cables referring to them
                        today. I don’t think it does. It’s just terribly hard to evaluate the
                        psychology of these rebels. I don’t know whether you noticed a cable that
                        came in here about a week ago but it told of one of the rebel leaders in
                        Stanleyville going up to the former mayor of the city and taking a knife out
                        and slitting him down the front, reaching in and picking out his kidney and
                        eating it when the man was alive. Now, I don’t know how you deal with people
                        like that. I don’t know how you interpret what they’ll do if we fly an
                        airplane over there or if we drop some paratroopers. I talked to General
                        [Tecuma (sp?)], who is currently head of the Standing Group here in
                        Washington and who was formerly General <persName corresp="#p_WEG_1">Wheeler</persName>’s counterpart in the Belgian army, and he personally
                        has carried out operations in the Belgian Congo. And he says he thinks the
                        rebels are more affected by a show of power such as a drop of Belgian
                        paratroopers and would be less likely to kill the Americans under those
                        circumstances than they will be if we appear weak. And so I’m taking his
                        view plus <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Dean Rusk</persName>’s, but I can’t
                        guarantee it’s a proper interpretation of their psychology.</p>

                    <p>Pursuant to our telephone conversation Friday, I am attaching a memo from Mr.
                        Abbot Smith, Acting Chairman of the Board of National Estimates, on the
                        possible repercussions of the Stanleyville rescue operations.<note n="2" xml:id="d332fn2">Attached but not printed.</note> The paper indicates
                        the reaction among African states, principally those critical of our Congo
                        policy, as well as propaganda stirred up by the Communists, would be
                        vigorous although its extent would be inversely proportionate to the time
                        consumed in the operation.</p>
                    <p>It should be noted that the lack of precise knowledge as to the location of
                        the Americans and most Europeans at Stanleyville, and the fact there are
                        several hundred Europeans and some Americans in rebel-held territory outside
                        of Stanleyville, principally in Paulis, Watsa and Bunia, increases the
                        possibility of rebel massacres even if the operation (irrespective of how
                        carefully it is planned and executed) should accomplish its mission.</p>

                            on November 19 that his government had instructed him to state that it

                            citizens in Stanleyville. He asked <persName corresp="#p_GCH_1">Gbenye</persName> to name place, time, and representative, and said
                            that a U.S. representative would be prepared for discussions in Nairobi
                            or any other capital. On November 20, <persName corresp="#p_GCH_1">Gbenye</persName> announced that his “Foreign Minister,” Thomas
                            Kanza, had been charged with carrying out preliminary negotiations in
                            Nairobi and asked the U.S. Government to set a date. See Department of

                        The Secretary indicated he thought the terms would likely be unacceptable to
                        us. He said the Stanleyville people might be trying for time to get help
                        from Egypt, etc.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> said that we placed a
                        high value on the hostages, but that we couldn’t give up all of our position
                        and policy because of them.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> said he thought it was
                        good to accept the offer and that we proposed to send a message today
                        offering to talk and asking when and where.</p>
                    <p>Our next step would be to get clearance from the Belgians for a program
                        offering amnesty, no prosecution for political crimes, etc., in return for
                        recognition of the authority of the Central Government and release of
                        hostages. The Secretary said it was his personal belief that the rebels
                        would not accept the offer. However, it was important for the record in the
                        United States and in Africa.</p>
                    <p>This discussion would not put on ice or interfere with military
                        operations.</p>
                    <p>If this track succeeds, the Secretary continued, we would have difficulties
                        with <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> who want an outright military
                        victory.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary concluded that he thought this was the best thing to do.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> agreed with what he
                        said was a clear statement by the Secretary. He then added that it was
                        important to take this action in view of world opinion and <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> opinion.</p>
                    <p>Secretary McNamara agreed.</p>
                    <p>The President said it would put us in a bad light if we didn’t act.</p>
                    <p>John <persName corresp="#p_MJA_1">McCone</persName> said this is the thing to
                        do. He said the palaver would increase the safety of Americans in the rest
                        of Africa.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked how many Americans there were in rebel territories,
                        what they were doing and how many were government employees. He was given
                        the answer.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BMG_1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> then pointed out that
                        the missionaries were a very determined people. When they were asked to get
                        out they refused <pb n="486" facs="0519" xml:id="pg_486"/>to get out because
                        they wanted to continue their work, and when something happened, they were
                        insistent upon protection.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked the Vice President for his views and he said he was
                        in accord with what had gone on before. The President then asked Governor
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName> if he was as
                        pessimistic as the Secretary as to the chances of success in the
                        negotiations. He said that he agreed with the Secretary’s position except
                        that he thought that there was some chance that if the rebels could be made
                        to see how desperate their position was, that there would be some give. The
                        President then wondered when the decision to move ahead with Dragon Rouge
                        would have to be made. The Secretary indicated that it would be about the
                        24th, however, Secretary McNamara indicated that it might come earlier. He
                        pointed out that De <persName corresp="#p_KCD_1">Kerchove</persName> had
                        been delegated the authority by Brussels to decide when to go. McNamara
                        indicated the President might have to make a decision within 48 hours. The
                        President asked if he ought to stay in Washington. Everyone thought that it
                        wasn’t necessary, in fact it would be counter productive as we wanted to
                        keep the matter as low key as possible. The President said he thought it was
                        wise to let <persName corresp="#p_VCF_1">Van der Walle</persName> go ahead
                        but to hold up the decision on Dragon Rouge.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BMG_1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> then raised the
                        question whether the President shouldn’t make a broadcast to <persName corresp="#p_GCH_1">Gbenye</persName> instead of <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> but again everyone agreed that the
                        matter should not be so accelerated. The President asked if there was any
                        dissenting views on the whole matter and there were none expressed.</p>

                        we are prepared to discuss with him the safety of US nationals in the
                        Stanleyville area. Other African posts are told to get word to Kanza, the
                        rebels’ representative in East Africa, that <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fredericks</persName> is en route prepared for sustained
                        discussions.</p>
                    <p>The message reflects one recommendation of a briefing paper that went to Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> for the meeting (which we
                        got after you had left). The purpose of the proposed discussions, according
                        to the briefing paper, is to keep contact with the rebels alive, and the
                        rebels presumably in a false state of expectation, during the next few days
                        when they will be growing increasingly desperate as <persName corresp="#p_VCF_1">Van der Walle</persName> approaches Stanleyville.</p>
                    <p>I don’t quarrel with this approach, although I see in it certain dangers when
                        the rebels realize that they’ve been tricked. I have serious reservations,
                        however, about another recommendation of the paper. This would call for
                        discussions with key <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> personnel
                            (<persName corresp="#p_KJO_1">Kenyatta</persName>, Diallo <persName corresp="#p_TBD_1">Telli</persName>) proposing a political package under
                        which we and the Belgians would jointly undertake to compel <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to take certain actions, such as offering amnesty to
                        the rebels, which might induce them to lay down their arms. The <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> would hopefully join with us in trying to
                        sell this package to the rebels.</p>
                    <p>I do not yet know whether this approach will be included in <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Wayne Fredericks</persName>’ instructions but I see
                        serious dangers in it. First, we are suggesting to influential <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> representatives that we can control
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>. (You will recall that we denied
                        this vigorously when the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> pressed us to
                        ground the T–28s and B–26s.) More importantly, if we make this approach and
                        then go forward with Dragon Rouge, we would be accused by the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> of having acted in bad faith. (Diallo
                            <persName corresp="#p_TBD_1">Telli</persName>, who is no friend of the
                        US, would wring this for all it’s worth.) The alternative, which is equally
                        as bad, would be to find ourselves committed to a “negotiated” solution.</p>
                    <p>I understand that State is now preparing <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Wayne
                            Fredericks</persName>’ instructions. I will keep you advised of any

                        Nairobi Friday evening.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Begin text of guidelines</hi>. First objective of <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_GCH_1">Gbenye</persName> message emphasizing willingness to negotiate is to
                        avoid accusation in US and Africa that US unwilling respond initiative which
                        could affect life US citizen. Second objective, equally important, is to use
                        confrontation with rebels, if it can be arranged, to test whether rebels are
                        ready to accept restoration of <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>
                        authority under terms which 1) would make unnecessary invasion Stanleyville,
                        2) would offer prospect of extracting hostages at minimal risk, 3) could be
                        imposed on <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> by concerted US-Belgian
                        pressures, and 4) would help rehabilitate US–<gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> relations.</p>
                    <p>While our primary effort is to try to bring about rebel acceptance
                        restoration <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> authority Stanleyville
                        which would make military solution unnecessary, we do not envisage this
                        initiative as replacing present military efforts. We believe it is only
                        credible threat of <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> capability and
                        will to decapitate rebellion by military means which might predispose rebels
                        to end hostilities under acceptable terms. Further, this initiative does not
                        presuppose any delay of military thrust. We recognize, however, rebels will
                        seek delaying action in order renew build-up of rebel confidence, increase
                        possibility of external military support to rebel forces. These factors make
                        it imperative adopt hard line with rebels, stressing tight deadlines and, if
                        necessary, a take-it-or-leave-it approach with consequences clearly spelled
                        out of rebel refusal to sign-on.</p>
                    <p>Political deal we would propose picks up themes from aborted <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> declaration as agreed by
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> during his visit to US:
                            <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> guarantee of personal safety to
                        all rebels who lay down their arms, <pb n="489" facs="0522" xml:id="pg_489"/>public offer of political amnesty, no prosecution of political crimes,
                        full freedom to engage in political activity in preparation for forthcoming
                        early elections, and right of all to hold office if elected. If rebels
                        indicate any interest, we are prepared to offer, in concert with Belgians
                        and possibly <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>, a major effort to win
                            <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> acceptance and to examine
                        possibility of arranging some sort of neutral presence (e.g.
                            US-Belgian-<gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>) in Stan to assure
                        physical safety and order during transfer to <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> control and further presence (e.g., <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> observers) to assure other undertakings
                        are fulfilled. This might even include token forces—hopefully from <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>, though possibly even US-Belgian with
                            <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> blessing.</p>
                    <p>Precise terms and modalities of course might be made to conform in some
                        degree to specific, perhaps even personal, rebel demands. Therefore, would
                        be most helpful, if talks with rebels materialize for Belgium to position an
                        officer in whom <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> has full
                        confidence to consult with our negotiator on the spot. Hennequiau would be a
                        possibility.</p>
                    <p>We recognize that keystone to whole enterprise would be US–<gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> concerted démarche to <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> in event rebels seem forthcoming in
                        meaningful and realistic sense. The US and <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> must be prepared clearly indicate that present and future
                        relations with Congo in jeopardy unless <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> is willing to end hostilities under settlement terms
                        outlined above. Our objective, therefore, is to gain <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> go-ahead with clear understanding that
                        negotiations are ad referendum but that both governments prepared to
                        consider such a deal seriously, including potential heavy pressure on <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>, if our exploration with rebels so
                        warrants.</p>
                    <p>We believe this final effort absolutely essential to build irrefutable record
                        of US–<gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> attempts to gain political
                        settlement as well as being one final effort to secure safety of hostages
                        short of perilous military solution.</p>
                    <p>Nor do we entirely discount possibility that even at this late date such a
                        maneuver might work. We have never had any illusions that political deal
                        could be consummated except at point when all possible alternatives to
                        rebels had been slammed shut. That time has now arrived. It is crucial we
                        try to test rebel response. <hi rend="italic">End of guidelines
                            text</hi>.<note n="3" xml:id="d338fn3">In telegram 1011 from Brussels,
                            November 20, MacArthur reported that <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> considered the proposed negotiations with the
                            rebels dangerous. Kanza would immediately request a cease-fire as quid
                            pro quo for evacuation of the hostages, but the Congo could not be
                            forced to accept a cease-fire, and refusal to accept a cease-fire would
                            be exploited internationally. (Ibid.) In a telephone conversation with

                            talked with MacArthur, who told him the Belgians thought it would be a
                            great mistake to send <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fredericks</persName>

                    <p>Our only very hot spot at the moment is the Congo. Here is where we are:</p>
                    <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_VCF_1">Van der Walle</persName> mercenary column is
                        on its way with little opposition so far and could reach Stanleyville in two
                        or three days with luck.</p>
                    <p>2. Rebels have broadcast another threat to American hostages using the name
                        of U.S. Consul <persName corresp="#p_HMP_1">Hoyt</persName> who is held in
                        Stanleyville.</p>
                    <p>3. At the same time rebels have agreed to discuss with a U.S. representative
                        in Nairobi. We are publicly accepting this offer and proposing talks at noon
                        tomorrow (3 a.m. Washington time) with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AWH_1">Attwood</persName> speaking for us.<note n="2" xml:id="d339fn2">Telegram 1916 to Nairobi, November 20, instructed
                                <persName corresp="#p_AWH_1">Attwood</persName> to inform <persName corresp="#p_KJO_1">Kenyatta</persName> immediately that, in response
                            to the rebel request to fix a date for negotiations in Nairobi, he was
                            requesting a meeting at noon on November 21, and to ask him to arrange
                            for participation by Kanza and any other participants decided upon by
                            himself or by the rebels. (Ibid.)</note></p>
                    <p>4. The Belgians are resistant to any concessions that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and Co. might find unacceptable,
                        and accordingly <persName corresp="#p_AWH_1">Attwood</persName>’s
                        instructions will be quite general and directed at maintaining the palaver
                        while warning strongly of consequences of any hostile act. <persName corresp="#p_AWH_1">Attwood</persName> is a skillful negotiator and we
                        hope very much that these talks will help protect hostages while the

                        advances.</p>
                    <p>5. Very weak security has now forced the Belgian Government to announce that
                        the troops with air support are at Ascension Island as a precautionary
                        measure. We have confirmed this announcement.<note n="3" xml:id="d339fn3">On
                            November 20, a Belgian Government spokesman announced that the First

                            aid of U.S. planes, and that, in view of the danger to their nationals
                            in Stanleyville, both governments considered it their duty to take
                            preparatory measures in order to be able to effect, if necessary, a
                            humanitarian rescue operation. (Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, December 14, 1964, p. 840)</note></p>
                    <p>6. Tomorrow, Saturday, we shall need to consider whether it is wise to
                        advance paratroopers to Kamina or to execute against Stanleyville. George
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> and I are both very
                        cautious at this point and would probably recommend against action when what
                        we face is threat, not <pb n="491" facs="0524" xml:id="pg_491"/>open act of
                        violence. <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> may be marginally
                        more activist.<note n="4" xml:id="d339fn4">The sentence originally began:

                            crossed out.</note> All of us will be much affected by <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName>’s judgment at the time. Belgium
                        Government alarm appears to be increasing.</p>
                    <p>Bromley Smith and George <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> are
                        here and fully informed, and can tell you more by telephone if you wish.</p>
                    <p>I will also be fully informed and participate by telephone in discussions
                        tomorrow and Sunday as needed.</p>
                    <p>The talks in Nairobi, and the unobstructed course of the <persName corresp="#p_VCF_1">Van der Walle</persName> column so far give me
                        considerable hope that we can avoid the hazards of actual execution of
                        paratroop drop, but this situation is subject to change at very short

                        purpose in agreeing to these discussions is (1) to avoid public stance of

                        to Brussels to which Belgians have objected.</p>
                    <p>In discussions with Kanza, <persName corresp="#p_AWH_1">Attwood</persName>
                        should be guided by following:</p>
                    <pb n="492" facs="0525" xml:id="pg_492"/>
                    <p>1. Objective of discussion is safety civilian population Stan, including all
                        foreigners. We cannot discuss our current problems under threats of
                        executions. If any foreign resident of Stan is killed for political reasons,
                        we shall terminate discussions at once and resort to such other measures as
                        may be necessary.</p>
                    <p>2. We can not entertain any proposals whatsoever for cease fire, which is in
                        fact completely in control of Congo Government.</p>
                    <p>3. If Kanza raises matter of “bombings” by US aircraft, you should make clear
                        to him no bombs in Congo, aircraft are responsibility <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>, and that at our instigation on
                        humanitarian grounds, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> has
                        given undertakings which are being respected not to attack cities and towns
                        which would endanger civilian populations.</p>
                    <p>4. You should make clear to Kanza hopelessness rebel position. It is
                        everywhere on defensive and cause is lost. Moreover he should be aware there
                        no split between <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and he therefore cannot
                        bank on this development. Under circumstances he should grasp realities of
                        situation and persuade his colleagues give up and salvage what they can. If
                        he has proposals or suggestions which fall short of cease fire or removal
                        foreign military assistance and which would result in peaceful resolution of
                        conflict and safety foreign population Stan, we prepared to examine them and
                        if feasible take them up with <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> to obtain their compliance.
                        Obviously, we not in position guarantee anything, but you should make clear
                        that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would make strongest efforts
                        obtain <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> agreement to reasonable and realistic proposals which
                        result in restoration <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> sovereignty
                        over northeast Congo, liquidation rebellion and safety civilian
                        population.</p>
                    <p>5. In event Kanza responds affirmatively and makes any specific proposals,
                        you should immediate inform Dept repeating <gloss target="#t_Leo_1">Leo</gloss> and Brussels. While you should not take any initiative in

                        such possibilities if Kanza proposes them.</p>
                    <p>6. In any event you must not break off talks but insure that at end of
                        meeting you have agreement to meet following day for further discussion.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>1. The morning’s meeting was devoted to the question of moving the Belgian
                        paratroopers from Ascension to Kamina. There were divergent views with
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName> favoring not moving
                        them until the last minute and then staging through Kamina in order to give
                        maximum element of surprise. <persName corresp="#p_CJH_1">Cleveland</persName>, while not taking a strong position either way,
                        expressed greatest concern over the fact that the paratroopers would move
                        without a written invitation and request from <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, and also some recognition at the U.N. that the movement
                        was humanitarian. All others favored the move. As a matter of record, I took
                        a very strong position that we should move up to a point nearest to
                        Stanleyville but reserved as to whether we should move immediately from
                        Kamina to Stanleyville, should coordinate the move with the <persName corresp="#p_VCF_1">Van der Walle</persName> column which would involve a
                        delay at Kamina or alternatively should hold at Kamina permitting the column
                        to take Stanleyville.</p>
                    <p>2. There was no decision made concerning operations from Kamina onward,
                        however, the decision was reached that the column should be moved from
                        Ascension to Kamina and orders were given to that effect after clearing with
                        President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> by telephone.</p>
                    <p>3. The evening meeting was called to make the decision concerning an
                        immediate move on Stanleyville from Kamina. Information was presented to
                        show that the stopover time at Kamina could be as little as three hours and
                        if the entire operation went without hitch or interruption, then it was
                        possible to drop at Stanleyville at 4:00 o’clock Stanleyville time. This
                        would give three hours of daylight for the paratrooper operation. It was
                        decided that this would be unsatisfactory as it would be impossible to
                        organize the paratroopers in the three hours and to effectively <pb n="495" facs="0528" xml:id="pg_495"/> rescue the hostages. Hence, it would give
                        the rebels a full night for their reprisal operations which in all
                        probability would be disastrous.</p>
                    <p>4. It was noted that a final decision to move for the drop at the first hour
                        of daylight on Monday would have to be taken by 6:00 p.m. on Sunday. The
                        decision for the Sunday afternoon drop would have to be taken by 3:00 a.m.
                        Sunday morning, e.s.t.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> questioned <persName corresp="#p_WEG_1">Wheeler</persName> at length about the backup. He
                        expressed concern that if the Belgian paratroopers get into trouble, then we
                        have answered nothing and we will have a real problem on our hands. Also he
                        was concerned about the incoming transports meeting ground fire with
                        disastrous consequences. <persName corresp="#p_WEG_1">Wheeler</persName>
                        noted that there was no backup for the paratroopers. It would be impossible
                        to deploy the U.S. brigade in less than 66 hours. There was no further
                        Belgian resources as the one paratrooper battalion was all that they had and
                        no approach had been made to the French, Germans, etc. With respect to this
                        problem, it was agreed to deploy a squadron of C–130’s to a base in Spain so
                        this could be available to move in any one of several directions. An effort
                        should be made to secure French, Italian or Belgian battalion in position as
                        a backup.</p>
                    <p>6. With respect to the danger of running into ground fire, <persName corresp="#p_WEG_1">Wheeler</persName> assured <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> the B–26’s and the T–28’s would
                        ferret out any ground fire or anti-aircraft equipment which was in position
                        and, hence, the paratrooper operation would be reasonably safe. <persName corresp="#p_WEG_1">Wheeler</persName> pointed out there had been severe
                        limitations on operation of B–26’s and T–28’s and also in the use of two
                        American pilots who were working with [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                            not declassified</hi>] in the operation of these planes. <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> ordered that all inhibitions on the
                        use of these planes be immediately removed and that they be authorized to
                        support the battalion. This included the use of the two American pilots on
                        the T–28’s.</p>
                    <p>7. With respect to the drop, <persName corresp="#p_WEG_1">Wheeler</persName>
                        expressed very positive views that we must have, at best, a full day of
                        daylight and he therefore recommended the brigade be held until early Monday
                        morning and the drop take place on Monday unless information that developed
                        on Sunday indicated it wise to hold for another day.</p>
                    <p>8. This view coincided with the unanimous view of those present and also with
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName>’s very strongly expressed
                        view.</p>
                    <p>10. Throughout the day I carefully advanced <gloss target="#t_DDP_1">DDP</gloss>’s position that while any course of action was dangerous,
                        the least dangerous course of action would be to have the <persName corresp="#p_VCF_1">Van der Walle</persName> brigade take Stanleyville
                        and to hold the paratroopers to support them if they got into trouble or if
                        a massacre started.</p>

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> said that the situation in
                        Stanleyville is deteriorating rapidly. Reports indicate whatever responsible
                        leaders were there are fleeing. The decision we have to make is whether we
                        move planes from Ascension to Kamina, where they would be four hours away
                        from Stanleyville. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> wants to do
                        it. It was delayed last night because we were concerned about creating
                        hysteria before we were prepared to have the paratroops drop over
                        Stanleyville. This morning we are in agreement we ought to do that. Averell,
                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WEG_1">Wheeler</persName> all agree this does not mean the decision to use
                        paratroops but to move them up within four hours to Stanleyville. Our
                        position regarding the Congolese government is we have an oral request to do
                        this from <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, but they’re
                        sitting on the written request in Stanleyville. There would be a few things
                        to sweep up if this is done. <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName>
                        has talked to the Secretary, who is in agreement.</p>
                    <p>President asked <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> to touch base
                        with McNamara. If he agrees, go ahead.</p>

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName>: This is <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Dean Rusk</persName>. I have here on my end a
                        conference call with Cy <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>,
                        General <persName corresp="#p_WEG_1">Wheeler</persName>, John <persName corresp="#p_MJA_1">McCone</persName>, George <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName>, Averell <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName>, and myself. We want to talk a moment about the
                        Congo situation. I think you were informed earlier today that the situation
                        in Stanleyville apparently deteriorated somewhat further. The leadership
                        that we’ve been trying to bicker with apparently is not in the city. The
                        venue apparently is over on the border of Uganda. The military man <persName corresp="#p_ONI_1">Olenga</persName> is apparently up on the border of
                        Sudan, and the elements in Stanleyville appear to be the most irresponsible
                        group there, the so-called <hi rend="italic">jeunesse</hi>, the rebel
                        private personnel, that is the troops.</p>
                    <p>Now we’ve been talking about this operation that you’re familiar with and we
                        would like to send a message tonight saying that upon arrival at Kamina, the
                        aircraft and forces should prepare to execute the operation at first light
                        on Monday morning, November 23. Do not execute unless directed by the Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff. The order to execute would be sent prior to a given hour
                        here unless developments in the next 18 hours indicate the desirability of
                        further postponement. Then we tell them in a second paragraph that the
                        aircraft should be refueled immediately upon arrival in Kamina in case
                        further marked deterioration in Stanleyville requires us to have them go
                        earlier, that is the afternoon before. Now this coincides with the views of
                        the Belgians, who are taking the major burden here and have the major
                        responsibility. We have had a thorough discussion here. The Chiefs of Staff
                        are fully on board with this line of action. So is Cy <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>. There is one—.</p>

                        him before I came over here, sir.</p>

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: Yeah, OK, all right.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName>: There’s some differences down
                        the line in <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> that I think John <persName corresp="#p_MJA_1">McCone</persName> ought to mention to you. John,
                        would you speak to that point?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_MJA_1">McCone</persName>: Yes, Mr. President. The
                        difference at <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> is there is one group
                        that feel that probably the consequences on the hostages would be lessened
                        if the particular operation were held up and moved only in the event that
                        things broke out before the Vanderwaele [<hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_VCF_1">Van der Walle</persName></hi>] column went in.
                        They feel that the most advantageous situation from the standpoint of the
                        hostages would be for the column to take Stanleyville rather than to resort
                        to this drop. Now there is a difference within the Agency on this point, and
                        really it’s a matter of opinion more than anything that you can really
                        prove.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName>: Mr. President, I think that all
                        of us feel that we should say to you that we can’t think of any line of
                        action here that would be sure to pick up live hostages throughout, and if
                        we don’t do anything, we’ll find corpses and some corpses if we take an
                        action of this sort by execution order tomorrow, that we’re likely to find
                        some corpses. But we don’t have any feeling at all that there’s any
                        responsible authority in Stanleyville that can give anybody any protection.
                        Now our Embassy in Brussels will be talking with <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> tomorrow to get his final judgment
                        before we recommend whether to push the button for an actual move. But this
                        will get us in a position to move quickly if we have to move with the least
                        possible warning and to get them thoroughly prepared to move at first light
                        on Monday.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: What does this do, Dean?
                        Move them up a few hours?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName>: Well, all this does is to give
                        them in effect an alert time for the most probable hour of commitment, but
                        it does not—, it specifically says do not execute unless directed by <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss>.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: Does it move—, does it
                        physically move them from where they are?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName>: It doesn’t move them from where
                        we’ve already ordered them, that is in Kamina.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: All this does is just say:
                        “get ready.”</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName>: That’s right.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: Now John, do you agree this
                        ought to be done?</p>

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: Do you—, then you’ve got a

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_MJA_1">McCone</persName>: No, but I can’t ignore

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: No, I’m not saying you

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_MJA_1">McCone</persName>: No, I can’t agree with that

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: You agree with what Dean’s

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: OK. Go ahead, Dean.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName>: Well, I do think we ought to
                        give as much weight as we can to the Belgian [predominance]. And they have
                        several hundred hostages, and they’re putting in the paratroopers and are
                        going to take casualties, and <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName>
                        seems to feel that it’s important to move. I think the Belgians—.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: How many people, how many
                        paratroopers are they putting in?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName>: Approximately a thousand,
                        sir.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: Now all we’re doing is
                        furnishing the planes?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName>: That’s right, sir, and 200
                        American military aircrews on those planes. In other words, we’re running
                        some risk ourselves.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: Now wait a minute. Repeat
                        that. How many Americans?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName>: It’ll be about 200 American air
                        crews on those planes, but no combat troops.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: How’re they going to—,
                        they’ll shoot the planes down you mean, that’s the danger?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName>: Well, we could lose some
                        Americans if they shot the planes down. That’s right, sir. But these will be
                        given cover with T–28s and B–26s that are already in the Congo, and they
                        will use these planes to go ahead of the drop and also to help them deliver
                        suppressive fire if anything comes out of the ground at them.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: Do they have any
                        anti-aircraft?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName>: We’re not absolutely certain
                        what is at Stanleyville at this point. They had some. Some of the
                        anti-aircraft that they had at Stanleyville turned up in Bukavu, so we know
                        that some of it was moved away, but we don’t know what is there or who’s
                        there to man it. But these planes should be—, these T–28s and B–26s should
                        be able to find that out before the paratroop-carrying planes actually
                        arrive on the scene.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: A thousand men in the
                        paratroop group?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName>: That’s right, sir. Now this is
                        a highly trained elite group that is actually the palace guard in Belgium.
                        This is the best outfit they’ve got. The Belgians are very confident that if
                        they get down and if they get there, that they will not run into serious
                        problems. They’ve had a lot <pb n="500" facs="0533" xml:id="pg_500"/>of
                        experience in the Congo and they feel certain that if it is necessary to
                        commit these troops that the troops will take care of themselves.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: Where’s <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName>?</p>

                            that U.S. and Belgian political and military people were meeting at
                            Kamina and that Washington should have a report by 3 p.m. He said
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> was waiting for a
                            report from that meeting before making a final decision and the United
                            States would go along with the Belgian decision, whether to postpone or
                            to go ahead. If there was any news from <persName corresp="#p_AWH_1">Attwood</persName>, they could take that into account as well.

                            at the Ranch and midnight in the Congo. In response to <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>’s question regarding the

                            stated that the only purpose was the humanitarian one of evacuating

                        We have had a report now from the meeting that took place at Kamina. The
                        military has recommended that the operation be held up one more night to
                        coordinate with the column.</p>
                    <p>J: How far are you by air from . . .</p>
                    <p>B: 3 hours.</p>
                    <p>J: How many miles?</p>
                    <p>B: About 1,000.</p>
                    <p>J: Where is the column?</p>
                    <p>B: It is at Labutto. It then, by moving all night, can reach there Tuesday
                        morning. It would reach there at the same time that the drop would
                        occur.</p>
                    <p>J: How many in the column?</p>
                    <p>B: 600.</p>
                    <p>J: There are 800 in our outfit?</p>
                    <p>B: 800 to be dropped and 600 in the column. There is enough force there to
                        take care of the situation. <persName corresp="#p_WEG_1">Wheeler</persName>
                        is clear on this.</p>
                    <p>J: What do they have?</p>
                    <pb n="504" facs="0537" xml:id="pg_504"/>
                    <p>B: It is hard to tell.</p>
                    <p>J: Then, how does he know he can take care of it?</p>
                    <p>B: They are finding that the forces have largely left. It has been the
                        experience of coming in and finding the troops on the run when they
                        encounter the column or any kind of air cover. On the basis of all the
                        experiences there would seem to be no likelihood of meeting resistance, and
                        there is no indication that they are likely to meet much. The expectation
                        is, and it seems to be agreed by all, military on both sides, that they will
                        have an easy time of it.</p>
                    <p>M. <persName corresp="#p_BMG_1">Bundy</persName>: In military terms either
                        force can win a battle in Stanleyville. The Kamina–Stanleyville distance we
                        have checked is 2 hours in the air. The theory is to get them in Tuesday
                        morning early. That has an advantage of putting the paratroopers in. We have
                        some ease on the scene as to what is going on. In military terms, to do the
                        two things at once seems very clear. This is the Belgian military in
                        Brussels concurring with their own advisors in the field. There is no reason
                        to think that the hostages may be in great danger for one more day.</p>
                    <p>B: The only new element that will increase the danger is that there has been
                        a leak through London that the planes have left Ascension. We will have to
                        use the fall-back release that we had worked out with the Belgians,
                        confirming the fact that the planes have left Ascension but simply say they
                        have moved up to a point closer to Stanleyville and are not presently en
                        route to Stanleyville. I think this is not a very serious matter but there
                        is always risk in one more day, but there is ability of mobility and seeking
                        out the hostages because the column will have wheels and transport.</p>
                    <p>J: Had we anticipated that the paratroopers to go in first?</p>
                    <p>B: We had thought that might be done and we decided on their recommendation
                        to put the two together. There is an advantage in not having this look like
                        a military operation but a humanitarian operation. We were motivated by the
                        fact that the situation in Stanleyville was deteriorating so rapidly that we
                        wanted to get the quickest force in. During the day there has been no
                        evidence that the situation is falling apart any more. There have been no
                        radio intercepts. There is a meeting later tonight between <persName corresp="#p_AWH_1">Attwood</persName> and Kanza. We may have some
                        further light on the situation when that meeting takes place. I think there
                        is a good deal for arguing for accepting the Belgian view. This is a
                        unanimous consent here by <persName corresp="#p_WEG_1">Wheeler</persName>,
                        McNamara, <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName>.</p>
                    <p>J: O.K. Go ahead.</p>

                    <p>STRIKE 1089/64. Subject is: Sequence of events on order to execute Dragon
                        Rouge (S).</p>
                    <pb n="506" facs="0539" xml:id="pg_506"/>
                    <p>1. (TS) The following gives you a time sequence of execution of Dragon Rouge
                        in order that there be no misunderstanding during this crucial phase. This
                        discussion is based on the fact that you are considered to be on a [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] with a 2 hour
                        ready to launch alert time, and that the tentative launch hour from Kamina
                        is 0100Z.</p>
                    <p>2. (TS) The decision time in Washington to order execution should be no later
                        than 2200Z. Safe transmission time of the execute message to you is
                        considered to be one hour. Therefore, the order to execute should be in your
                        hands at Kamina at 2300Z.</p>
                    <p>3. (TS) In spite of the optimum conditions stated above, the decision to
                        execute may run up to the last minute and perhaps beyond the 2200Z deadline.
                        Therefore, you should be prepared to react in the minimum possible time
                        after receipt of order to execute.</p>
                    <p>4. (TS) You will be directed to increase your readiness posture using the
                        STRIKE MEAFSA emergency action file (SMEAF) by flash STRIKEOPS 2A message by
                        teletype. These messages will include instructions as follows:</p>
                    <p>A. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] (to be
                        effective 2300Z). Load all equipment on C–130 aircraft. Prepare personnel
                        for loading. Ready B–26 and T–28 support aircraft for launch. Tentative
                        D-Day H-Hour will be announced in blanks 6 and 7 of STRIKEOPS <gloss target="#t_msg_1">msg</gloss>. Blank 6 will be D-Day; blank 7 will be
                        H-Hour.</p>
                    <p>B. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] (to be
                        effective 0030Z). Load personnel on aircraft, taxi and prepare to launch
                        troop carrier and tactical aircraft. Launch hour will be confirmed as 0100Z.
                        You will not launch until told to execute.</p>
                    <p>C. Order to execute will be by unclassified words Big Punch, transmitted in
                        the clear. The word Punch, in accordance with a US/Belgian agreement,
                        indicates that the order to execute is a combined US/Belgian decision.</p>
                    <p>5. (TS) After order to execute has been given, there may be reason to rescind
                        the order and call off the assault. The unclassified words for this will be
                        Dragon Rouge Blue Fish, and will be given you by voice in the clear. Upon
                        receipt of Blue Fish, you will return all aircraft to Kamina and await
                        further instructions.</p>
                    <p>6. (TS) Prior to launch from Kamina and prior to receipt of the order to
                        execute, the decision may be made to either cancel or delay the planned
                        assault. The unclassified words Blue Fish will be used for this event also.
                        You will then return to a [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] readiness posture with a 2 hour alert time and await
                        further orders.</p>
                    <p>7. (U) Acknowledge.</p>

                    <p>Met Kanza at 0800Z at Gatundu. <persName corresp="#p_KJO_1">Kenyatta</persName> present, as he put it, in capacity Chairman Ad Hoc
                        Commission.</p>
                    <p>I covered first and second points instructions (reference A). Kanza then made
                        it plain his instructions were to discuss Congo in general, including
                        ceasefire not just “prisoners of war.” <persName corresp="#p_KJO_1">Kenyatta</persName> broke in with strong pitch for ceasefire as only
                        solution permitting <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> go to Stanleyville
                        and save lives.</p>
                    <p>I carefully explained not authorized discuss anything but safety hostages and
                        reminded <persName corresp="#p_KJO_1">Kenyatta</persName> discussion between
                        Kanza and me. Suggested best way prevent killings now would be action in
                        line point four instructions. Said time had come all concerned to be
                        realistic.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KJO_1">Kenyatta</persName> and Kanza both returned to
                        ceasefire argument, denouncing mercenaries (who must leave Congo forthwith)
                        and stressing total <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        dependence US and Belgian support. Kanza added <persName corresp="#p_GCH_1">Gbenye</persName> in full control Stanleyville though under great
                        popular pressure execute Carlson.</p>
                    <p>Realizing no headway possible, I then suggested that in view conflicting
                        instructions and critical situation, only way we could continue would be for
                        me report immediately to my government and meet Kanza again when I had
                        reply. Present meeting had at least clarified our positions. Kanza and
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJO_1">Kenyatta</persName> agreed.</p>
                    <p>I took this action only to avoid break in discussions in accordance point six
                        instructions.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KJO_1">Kenyatta</persName> said he hoped US would
                        understand and cooperate with <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> on
                        ceasefire, and that I would get quick reply from <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Kanza said Carlson alive and he would immediately notify <persName corresp="#p_GCH_1">Gbenye</persName> in Stanleyville to postpone
                        execution while our discussions in progress.</p>
                    <pb n="508" facs="0541" xml:id="pg_508"/>
                    <p>With concurrence Kanza and <persName corresp="#p_KJO_1">Kenyatta</persName>,
                        I then made following statement to press:</p>
                    <p>“I have had a preliminary discussion with Mr. Kanza, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KJO_1">Jomo Kenyatta</persName> attended our meeting in his
                        capacity as Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Ad Hoc
                        Commission on the Congo. On the basis of today’s discussion, Mr. Kanza and I
                        have agreed to meet again as soon as I have consulted my government.”</p>
                    <p>In response to question about Carlson, I replied, “Mr. Kanza assures me he is
                        still alive.”</p>
                    <p>After meeting with Kanza, I requested few minutes alone with <persName corresp="#p_KJO_1">Kenyatta</persName>. Mathu and Koinange also
                        remained. Outlined actual situation in line reference B and said if rescue
                        operation becomes necessary as last resort it would be just that, with
                        minimum loss of life, quick withdrawal, non-discriminatory, etc., aim only
                        to prevent massacre which also disaster for Africa.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KJO_1">Kenyatta</persName> looked pained at prospect
                        but I assured him this was contemplated only if all other efforts failed.
                        Explained I told him this in confidence as Ambassador to his country. He
                        understood, thanked me for confidence and reiterated hope our next meeting
                        with Kanza would make paratroop action unnecessary.</p>
                    <p>Previously, while drafting my statement, we considered adding “meanwhile
                        Kanza assured me no harm will befall civilians in Stanleyville while
                        discussions in progress.” Kanza first agreed, then refused on grounds
                        “mercenary” attack on Stanleyville would result in fighting and general
                        bloodshed which would not be responsibility Stanleyville authorities.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJO_1">Kenyatta</persName> backed him up, using
                        this as further argument for ceasefire.<note n="4" xml:id="d350fn4">In
                            telegram 1978 to Nairobi, November 23, the Department sent <persName corresp="#p_AWH_1">Attwood</persName> a flash response, informing
                            him that the decision had been made to execute Dragon Rouge at 0400Z
                            November 24 and instructing him to inform <persName corresp="#p_KJO_1">Kenyatta</persName> as soon as possible that he had received a
                            response from Washington that Kanza’s proposals, which used outrageous
                            threats against the lives of innocent civilians as blackmail to achieve
                            a military objective, i.e., a cease-fire, were totally unacceptable. As
                            soon as the Ambassador received the flash announcement of Dragon Rouge,
                            he was to call <persName corresp="#p_KJO_1">Kenyatta</persName> and
                            inform him that in view of the increased threats, the absence of
                            adequate assurances from Kanza, and the need to protect innocent lives,
                            it had been necessary to launch a rescue operation into Stanleyville.

                        However, time had come when lives of 1000 foreign women, children and men
                        were in mortal danger and we must face up to our responsibility and make a

                        hostages before arrival of column. Furthermore, if <gloss target="#t_VDW_1">VDW</gloss> arrives without <gloss target="#t_DR_1">DR</gloss> it will
                        enter Stan from east and have to make its way all across city against
                        resistance to west of city where hostages are believed concentrated,
                        obviously increasing risks for hostages. However if <gloss target="#t_DR_1">DR</gloss> implemented resistance expected to be very slight.</p>
                    <p>2. <gloss target="#t_Re_1">Re</gloss> alternative two (arrival of <gloss target="#t_VDW_1">VDW</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DR_1">DR</gloss> at
                        Stan Nov 24), if <gloss target="#t_DR_1">DR</gloss> is implemented, <gloss target="#t_VDW_1">VDW</gloss> column will be given minimum rest and
                        should be in position outside Stan reasonably early tomorrow morning (Nov
                        24). If <gloss target="#t_DR_1">DR</gloss> para drop occurs (west of city
                        where hostages believed to be), with <gloss target="#t_VDW_1">VDW</gloss>
                        outside city, estimate is there will be little if any real resistance and
                        maximum <gloss target="#t_VDW_1">VDW</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_DR_1">DR</gloss> resources will be available to rescue hostages soonest.</p>
                    <p>3. Alternative three (<gloss target="#t_DR_1">DR</gloss> on Nov 24 with
                            <gloss target="#t_VDW_1">VDW</gloss> arrival Nov 25). In view of present
                        rate of progress of <gloss target="#t_VDW_1">VDW</gloss> column, it will
                        arrive in Stan sometime tomorrow whether or not <gloss target="#t_DR_1">DR</gloss> implemented. Belgians have no reason to believe that <gloss target="#t_VDW_1">VDW</gloss> column can be held up 24 hours and are <pb n="510" facs="0543" xml:id="pg_510"/>certain that efforts to be so would
                        be bitterly and very probably successfully resisted by <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>. Furthermore, in terms of safety of
                        hostages there will obviously be less resources if <gloss target="#t_DR_1">DR</gloss> is implemented alone than if <gloss target="#t_VDW_1">VDW</gloss> column is there to assist.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> said that from the beginning of
                        planning of <gloss target="#t_DR_1">DR</gloss> basic criteria of whether we
                        would implement it was whether it would give maximum survival possibility
                        for foreign hostages. He firmly believes this must be the criteria. His
                        conclusion is that hostages will have maximum chance of survival if
                        alternative two (<gloss target="#t_DR_1">DR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_VDW_1">VDW</gloss> arrival Nov 24) is implemented.
                        Furthermore, he understands that both Belgian and American Embs and military
                        in Congo share this view. He recognizes that coincidental arrival of <gloss target="#t_VDW_1">VDW</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DR_1">DR</gloss> in
                        Stan Nov 24 will be exploited by those who will try to portray <gloss target="#t_DR_1">DR</gloss> as assistance to <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> rather than humanitarian effort but feels that this is
                        something we will have to accept since hanging in the balance are lives of
                        1000 men, women and children. He said it would be “grotesque” if we should
                        take the risk of holding up on <gloss target="#t_DR_1">DR</gloss> 24 hours
                        with resultant massacre of hostages. While <gloss target="#t_DR_1">DR</gloss> cannot guarantee safety of hostages, he believes its
                        implementation gives them maximum chance.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> said I should inform US Govt
                        that Belgian Govt view (concurred in by PriMin and DefMin) is that <gloss target="#t_DR_1">DR</gloss> should be implemented as planned Nov 24. The
                        decision was a very difficult one, charged with heavy responsibility but
                        Belgians felt it had to be faced up to. He asked that I inform Washington of
                        Belgian decision, making clear that final decision was joint decision with
                        each of us assuming equal responsibility for it. (I assured him that from
                        the very beginning we had understood it was joint decision with equal
                        responsibility.) <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> said if we
                        concur in implementation of <gloss target="#t_DR_1">DR</gloss> we send
                        “Punch” at once and inform him soonest through Emb Brussels so that he can
                        inform PriMin, DefMin and so that Belgian military can also confirm “Punch”
                        through their military channels to Belgian military in Congo. (<persName corresp="#p_BWH_1">Brubeck</persName> in telecon at 7:40 P.M. tonight
                        Brussels time informed me “Punch” has been sent and <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> immediately informed through

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: Hello.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName>: Hello. Yes, sir.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: Yes, Dean.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName>: Mr. President, I’ll put you on
                        with George <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> here in just a
                        moment. [inaudible] he’s been meeting with Bob McNamara about the Congo, but
                        the essence of it is that the Belgian cabinet is now meeting at this moment
                        to decide their view on whether it is in the best interest of the hostages
                        to go ahead and drop these fellows tomorrow morning. But let me put you on
                        with George <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> to bring you—, to
                        give you a little more detail on it. Hold on just a minute.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: [inaudible]</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName>: [inaudible] <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName>’s own view is that it’s necessary to
                        go ahead with the drop tomorrow morning. He feels that not to do so when
                        that force is assembled would in his words be grotesque. The situation is
                        that the column is moving by road and should be there not later than
                        mid-morning. The drop would take place at the first light of dawn, but the
                        combination of these two would,—one would reinforce the other.<note n="2" xml:id="d352fn2">See <ref target="#d347">Document 347</ref>, for a
                            record of <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName>’s November 22
                            telephone conversation with the President in which he reported that the
                            military had recommended holding up the paradrop operation one more
                            night so it could be coordinated with the arrival of the column at
                            Stanleyville.</note> And we’re expecting within the next half hour word
                        that the Belgian cabinet has made this decision. It’s,—we have to make a
                        final decision in order to get the word there by not later than 5 o’clock
                        this afternoon our time here, which is about three and a half hours from
                        now. So we wanted to get your reaction to this situation as it’s now
                        developing, Mr. President.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: I don’t think we’ve got any
                        choice, have we?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName>: I beg your pardon.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: I don’t think we’ve got any
                        choice, have we?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName>: I wouldn’t think so. We’re all
                        unanimous. Bob McNamara is right here and standing by, as well as Dean, and
                        we’re all in agreement as to what we have to do if the Belgians decide, as
                        appears to be the case now, that they want to go ahead.</p>
                    <pb n="512" facs="0545" xml:id="pg_512"/>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: What domestic reaction are
                        we going to get from the Negroes in this country?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName>: I think that what we have
                        prepared, Mr. President, is a dossier of the kind of messages that we have
                        been getting out of Stanleyville about the killing and the threats to eat
                        and burn and so on these hostages. I think that this could be represented
                        quite properly as a strictly humanitarian effort and I don’t think that it
                        should create any problem of that kind. We’ve made it clear that our rescue
                        efforts are directed towards the Congolese as well as toward our own people.
                        That is, that it’s not solely a matter of saving the white hostages.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: Is this in any way going to
                        involve us in getting us in there and getting us tied down there?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName>: Well, we’re very conscious of
                        that and of course these are not our troops that are being—.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: I understand that. I
                        understand that.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName>: And we’re all sensitive to the
                        idea that we get out just as fast as we can, that this is not a commitment
                        to get into a land fight in the middle of Africa.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: OK. We’ll talk a little
                        later, I gather.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName>: Now we’ve just had a message
                        while I’ve been talking to you. I was just handed a note saying that the
                        Belgian cabinet has formally approved the <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> recommendation and that if the United States concurs,
                        they would give the order for tomorrow morning.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: Well, you’re in agreement
                        then.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName>: We’re all in agreement.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: Well, all right. Let’s
                        go.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName>: Right.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: You don’t think we need to
                        check any more?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName>: Not unless there’s some new
                        development, Mr. President. Would you like to speak to Bob McNamara? He’s
                        right here.—Hello.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: How are you?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName>: I said, do you want to speak to
                        Bob McNamara?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: Yes, yeah.</p>
                    <p>McNamara: Yes, Mr. President. How are you?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: Very well, sir.—</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion of an unrelated subject.]</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>: Any other troubles?</p>
                    <p>McNamara: No sir, other than this one George was talking about, which is a
                        very great trouble, but which we’re all agreed on. We should go ahead if the
                        Belgians request that we do so. They have so requested.</p>

                        all Americans contained on special lists of Americans in Stanleyville area
                        have now been located and are safe with the exception of (a) the Loewen
                        family who are presumed O.K. and have not yet been picked up since they live
                        out of town, and (b) the two killed in action. Except for the two big
                        dramas, the casualties have been limited. Apparently when the paras started
                        coming and the Simbas heard the shooting, they began to herd Europeans to
                        the hotel. When the group of 250 being herded to <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> Square realized what was
                        happening, they broke and dispersed and went over the wall. Casualties were
                        those hit trying to get over the wall. Contrary to CBS 8:00 reports, there
                        is no real fighting in the airport area. Very few Congolese casualties.
                        About 30 Simba dead observed so far. No major killing of Congolese
                        civilians. Two <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>’s dead. None of the
                        rebel leaders caught so far. Wounded Congolese being evacuated by C–130 to
                            <gloss target="#t_Leo_1">Leo</gloss>. City being sectored with Belgian
                        paras operating one area for evacuation and <persName corresp="#p_VCF_1">Van
                            der Walle</persName> another area for cleanup, with Belgians moving back
                        more and more toward the airport. Stiff fighting still going on in European
                        residential areas. At rough estimate, 35–40 foreigners still unaccounted
                        for. Apparently some rebels have escaped to NE but no mass exodus. Although
                        move to take European hostages into bush began several days ago, few, if
                        any, actually taken away. All wounded due out tonight. About 200 evacuees
                        awaiting transportation at Stanleyville airport now. 350 taken out so far
                        today. 350 more expected out before the end of today. Planes being used in
                        shifts to rest crews. <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> Square
                        incidents—when Simbas heard the firing of paras coming into town, they began
                        herding foreigners out of houses toward <persName corresp="#p_LPE_1">Lumumba</persName> Wall for execution. When foreigners realized what
                        was happening, they broke and dispersed, going over a nearby wall. Those who
                        got over wall found themselves safe in hands of paras; those wounded and
                        killed were hit trying to get over the wall. Paras sticking solely to
                        humanitarian mission with <persName corresp="#p_VCF_1">Van der

                            <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>. Considerable fighting is taking
                        place on the left bank of the river with the probability that some Europeans
                        are located in that area. Van Der Walle is dealing with this. There is a
                        probability there is still considerable fighting going on within
                        Stanleyville itself and the clean up operation may take a number of

                    <p>1. I understand that a meeting will be called this morning to decide two
                        questions—</p>
                    <p>(i) Whether Dragon Rouge forces should be withdrawn to Kamina.</p>
                    <p>Basically this seems a political question. Leopoldville reports that
                        Stanleyville is secure enough for the Dragon Rouge forces to withdraw, and
                        Dragons Noir and Blanc could be launched from either Stanleyville or Kamina.
                        Those favoring withdrawal argue that it will emphasize the humanitarian
                        aspects of the Stanleyville drop. Others argue to the contrary, fearing that
                        the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> meeting tomorrow will interpret a
                        move to Kamina (as opposed to a withdrawal from the Congo) as an indication
                        that the Belgian forces intend to remain indefinitely.</p>
                    <p>(ii) Whether Dragons Blanc (Bunia) and Noir (Paulis) should be launched
                        tomorrow. Earlier, Leopoldville strongly recommended both drops.
                        Leopoldville wants to take no chances with what appears to be an established
                        rebel pattern of executing hostages. Subsequently, the Belgian para
                        commander recommended going forward only with Noir. Apparently, he feels
                        that his forces are tired and he wants to use two companies against Paulis
                        instead of one originally planned. (This would leave him one assault company
                        and one headquarters/support company.)</p>

                        had been launched two weeks earlier. After the fall of Kindu, Boende and
                        Bumba, the rebels were “psychologically defeated.” They began discarding
                        uniforms, etc., but after several weeks they became brave again.</p>

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> explained <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> feels strongly there ought to be
                        another drop at a place called Paulis, where there is a big concentration of
                        refugees. There are only 7 Americans but 450 other Europeans, mostly
                        Belgians. What would be involved would be half the force used at
                        Stanleyville—270 paras, 40–50 Americans, air crews for 7 planes. The final
                        decision doesn’t have to be made until this afternoon. The inclination here
                        (McNamara, <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MJA_1">McCone</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_WEG_1">Wheeler</persName>) is to do it because the Belgians do feel there is a
                        great obligation to their lives.</p>
                    <p>President said he wanted very much to accept this advice. His strongest
                        inclination, however, is against it. He had grave doubts about the other
                        one. He didn’t want to do it unless there are very compelling reasons felt
                        by everyone. Then he wants to know why we can’t get somebody to help us with
                        the Europeans. He doesn’t want to get tied in on the Congo and have another
                        Korea, another Viet-Nam, just because of somebody wandering around searching
                        for “Jesus Christ”. We made a mistake first of all running the Belgians out
                        and taking the position we did on <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and then embracing him, wrapping the colonial flag
                        around us and acting unilaterally, becoming labeled as aggressors. He said
                        he wanted all of them to consider these things. Then he wants to see why the
                        British won’t send planes, why the French won’t send planes. He doesn’t like
                        the unilateral operation of letting the Belgians bring us in. He doesn’t
                        want that image of running them out of the Congo and coming back with them.
                        He asked if <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> were here and <pb n="520" facs="0553" xml:id="pg_520"/><persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> told him he was in the White House at the moment at a
                        meeting on sugar.</p>
                    <p>President said he was upset about the leaks in the papers about what he is
                        going to do, and the way some good sources make it look like coming out of
                        the White House . . . The Alsop column, about <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName>’s memorandum, was very degrading to <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName>. He said he has not seen the
                        memorandum and knows nothing about such a memorandum. If we can’t run a
                        Government better than that . . . <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> replied we were annoyed; President said annoyed, but we
                        will have to put in effect a regulation like McNamara did, how instead of
                        letting the press run the Department, or some little FSOs. . . . He thought
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> should have a high-level
                        meeting and work on these Assistant Secretaries. Some of it may come from
                        the White House. He thought Taylor’s report was disgraceful. He is coming in
                        to tell the President how . . . that <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> magazine
                        article—has <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> seen it? <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> replied he had not. “If you’re going
                        to approve something as Administration policy. . . .” He asked if <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> had seen it first. <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> replied he had not. He asked if
                            <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> had seen it. <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> replied he did not know. President
                        asked <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> to tell the Secretary he
                        wanted to know; that those who approve Administration’s policy are
                        President; then <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName>; then <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName>. He is tired of Luce telling him what
                        the decision will be. We had to be gentlemanly three weeks ago, but now we
                        have to be patriotic. It’s inexcusable—these people telling what he is going
                        to do. <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> should sit down with
                        these newspapermen. Get it in proportion. No dramatic announcements and no
                        idea we are pulling out. Where is the proper perspective. Forrestal has gone
                        out. Sullivan is in and out. <persName corresp="#p_BMG_1">Bundy</persName>
                        was there. <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> was there. McNamara
                        was there. But blowing it up saying he is going to do it—it isn’t going to
                        happen. <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> agreed. Of course the
                        purpose of the meeting was that it was intended to be played down as much as
                        possible. Secretary should “get <persName corresp="#p_BMG_1">Bundy</persName>, Mac <persName corresp="#p_BMG_1">Bundy</persName> and
                        tell them I don’t want this happening where Taylor at all his stops (unless
                        they pay him heavily) should not be getting them (stories) in <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>.” <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName>
                        replied he would run it down.</p>
                    <p>President said to set up whatever precaution needed. Nobody is going to speak
                        for <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> without letting him
                        know. He thought our political needs needed another new look or we will have
                        all the Africans after us, all the Senators and others, etc.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> said he had conditioned this on
                        an immediate evacuation and getting the planes and paratroops out. All we
                        intended to do was an evacuation. The military was afraid this morning to
                        take them out until we were certain the airport was secured. In any event,
                        the idea would be, this force would go to Paulis only to evacuate the
                        people—in and out in 24 hours. President said suppose a plane would be shot
                        down. <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> replied there was a
                        risk—that can’t be denied. President said to get somebody else—get the
                        British. <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> replied as far as he
                        was aware they <pb n="521" facs="0554" xml:id="pg_521"/>had no nationals in
                        the Congo. President said then let’s not have any. Tell them this is it.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> said we had given warnings
                        they were there at their own risks. President asked if <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> had any planes at all, and <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> replied none to do this operation.
                        Unless it is done quickly, it should not be done. If we let it go for a
                        week, the people will be lost. President said his instinct would be to give
                        it further exploration.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion of an unrelated subject.]</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> said on the question of the
                        other matter, we will have to decide this afternoon. We will have further
                        talks here and either <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> or he
                        will call the President. President said to ask other people to
                        participate—the French. <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> said
                        there were no French there. There may be some Greeks and Turks and other
                        Europeans in very small numbers. President said everybody was smarter than

                    <p>M said he was here with the Prime Minister and friends. M said they recognize
                        that neither of us have precise information on all details of what is
                        happening to the people in that next place; they feel if it does not go
                        tonight and we go back to stop 5, the chances are very slim that one would
                        be able to do something; they feel that given the circumstances it would not
                        be understood if a force so close stopped; they feel that subject to the
                        possibility of getting out very quickly by the day after tomorrow, if there
                        is certitude we do not get stuck, their desire and inclination is to go
                        ahead with it; they would like to get out in the next 2–3 days. Sec said he
                        would talk to his principal then on the basis that they would like to do it.
                        M said unless it is very dubious that we can get out by Friday night. (There
                        was much conferring with and in the background on both sides during the
                        call.) M reported to <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> that we
                        do not have any judgment and we believe the Belgians would have more
                        knowledge on that factor than we. M said they think we should <pb n="522" facs="0555" xml:id="pg_522"/>put it right away to the two military there
                        whether they can give a reasonable guarantee we can be out in 48 hours; if
                        not, they would not be inclined to go ahead. M said the Prime Minister said
                        we should ask a guarantee; if not, let’s put it off and think about it and
                        have 24 hours . . . ; if they can give the guarantee, we should go and go
                        quickly; if impossible to give that guarantee tonight, postpone for 24
                        hours, return to Kamina and see how it looks; it would not be much more
                        difficult from there than from a secured Stan. They discussed communications
                        possibilities; not possible to get an answer back in 35 minutes. Sec said we
                        are the junior partner here but it might be hard to explain why this force
                        moves back before the job is done; if we say nothing, we will still make the
                        decision, which will be not to do it. Sec said you could always give the
                        order to come out. M said on the military responsibility, their people say
                        it is feasible if our air people continue to agree it is feasible. Sec said
                        our people say on strictly military side it is feasible. M said if military
                        feel it is feasible to wind up in 48 hours, and be out, they would like to
                        go. Sec will call back.<note n="2" xml:id="d360fn2">At 5:45 p.m., <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> telephoned MacArthur and said
                            that “the boss” shared their feelings, that he hoped it could be done as
                            quickly as possible, and that this was the last one. There should be no
                            waiting around for anyone to join them on the ground and no taking of
                            local prisoners. It was to be purely a rescue operation. MacArthur
                            agreed and said that they were very grateful on this. <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> said that Washington would flash

                        in Secretary MacArthur Telcon:</p>
                    <p>1. Operation to Paulis would be strictly in and out lasting no more than 24
                        hours, subject of course to overriding military US-Belgian exigencies
                        affecting safety of forces.</p>
                    <pb n="523" facs="0556" xml:id="pg_523"/>
                    <p>2. Dragon Noir force would not under any circumstances delay its departure
                        from Paulis to permit <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> to reoccupy city.
                        Nor would it take any rebel Congolese political or other prisoners.</p>
                    <p>3. As soon as Paulis evacuees returned Stanleyville and replaned to <gloss target="#t_Leo_1">Leo</gloss>, Dragon Rouge force would immediately
                        redeploy Kamina.</p>
                    <p>4. Within shortest possible time, force would then redeploy from Kamina via
                        Ascension, Las Palmas, Spain to Belgium.</p>
                    <p>Please see <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> soonest and confirm

                    </list>
                    <p>I called Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> to discuss
                        the air drops on Bunia and Watsa. <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> told me that after careful deliberation the Department
                        and the Belgian Government had decided they would not go forward with the
                        drops. He said they did not feel the recommendations of the embassies in
                        Leopoldville were valid because there was no meaningful inventory of the
                        number of European refugees in either city. Furthermore, there were no
                        Americans there. I dissented sharply from this decision. I said that I felt
                        neither Leopoldville nor the State Department knew very much about how many
                        refugees were in these two cities and that probably the statements of the
                        people from Stanleyville and Paulis were most authoritative. Furthermore,
                        there was evidence of atrocities that I did not think should go on. Finally,
                        if we did not conduct the drops, it would become obvious that our actions
                        against Stanleyville <pb n="524" facs="0557" xml:id="pg_524"/>were in effect
                        in support of the Congolese Army and humanitarian excuse could not be
                        supported. <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> responded that the
                        Paulis operation might change this appraisal. I said it might, but,
                        nevertheless, history would record it differently. I therefore said it was
                        my unreserved and very strong recommendation that we go forward. I could see
                        no excuse for not doing so. I thought the drops would be successful and felt
                        it was incumbent upon us to do so. <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> said, “thank you very much,” he would think the thing
                        over and reappraise the situation prior to the withdrawal of the
                        paratroopers from Kamina.</p>

                    <p>We have just been informed by <gloss target="#t_CINCSTRIKE_1">CINCSTRIKE</gloss> that the Paulis evacuation has now been completed
                        with the evacuation of nearly 400 refugees. The planes are safely back in
                        the air with the Belgian paratroopers and on their way to Kamina. Meanwhile,
                        there has been a partial redeployment to Kamina of the remaining paratrooper
                        force at Stanleyville; this redeployment will be completed tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>Present plans are that the entire paratrooper force will leave Kamina on
                        November 29 via Ascension, Las Palmas and Spanish bases to Belgium. This
                        delay from previous plans to begin the move on the 28th is occasioned by
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName>’s desire to have the
                        entire unit arrive in a group for appropriate ceremonies in Brussels.</p>
                    <p>Late yesterday afternoon, you suggested to Joe <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> that we should have a final look at the question of
                        possibly utilizing the force for other rescue operations in the Congo before
                        it is finally withdrawn. In the absence of any Belgian request for further
                        operations and in view of the fact that our information indicates that the
                        few remaining Americans are in locations which would not be affected by
                        paradrops, both Joe <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> and I
                        believe that the force should be withdrawn on the 29th according to the
                        foregoing plan.</p>

                    <p>Following an extraordinary meeting in Nairobi on November 27 and 28, 1964,
                        the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Ad Hoc Commission issued a
                        communiqué on November 28 strongly condemning foreign military intervention
                        in the Congo by the Governments of the United States, Belgium, United
                        Kingdom, and all other countries who made such intervention possible. It
                        recommended that the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Secretary General
                        call an extraordinary meeting of heads of state and government in Addis
                        Ababa on December 18. The Commission also agreed to make an interim report

                        withdrawal of all mercenaries; B) an immediate end to foreign military
                        intervention; C) a cease-fire; D) granting of a general amnesty; E) sending

                    <p>According to reliable sources, during the past few days Algeria, Ghana, the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss>, and Sudan have been actively
                        collaborating to provide military supplies to the Congolese rebels via
                        Khartoum and Juba. On November 27 a Soviet manufactured <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss> plane (an AN–12) arrived at Juba, in
                        southern Sudan, where it unloaded so-called medical supplies destined for
                        the rebels. Early in the morning of December 3rd a Ghanaian IL–18, which had
                        left Accra the previous day, arrived in Khartoum with a load of small arms.
                        It transferred its cargo to an Egyptian AN–12, which flew the load to Juba
                        very early on the morning of December 4. At least four Algerian AN–12
                        military aircraft carrying arms had completed their mission flying roundtrip
                        from Khartoum to Juba by December 4. Additional Algerian AN–12 aircraft flew
                        to Juba that same day from Khartoum carrying cargo destined for Congolese
                        rebels.</p>
                    <p>We also have information that prior to the fall of Stanleyville other African
                        states were assisting the rebels. These included not only Congo-Brazzaville
                        and Burundi but also Uganda. During October high Uganda Government officials
                        visited Stanleyville to confer with rebel authorities. They supplied
                        Stanleyville Radio with equipment and technicians. They also allowed more
                        than 35 trucks from the <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss> to pass through
                        Uganda to Stanleyville and later provided the rebels with gasoline.
                        Furthermore, on October 31 Uganda permitted an IL–18 to use its airfield at
                        Arua to discharge arms for the rebels.</p>

                        assistance being provided rebels. We, therefore, believe it advantageous
                        have separate complaint sent to <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> by
                        Congolese representative prior to Dec. 9 meeting. Our assumption is that
                        both African and Congolese countercomplaint would be discussed in <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> simultaneously. While evidence we possess is
                        still fragmentary, we believe it sufficient to justify placing considerable
                        focus on it during Council proceedings.</p>

                    <p>You may tell <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> we do not
                        envisage this initiative as a mere tactical device to counter African
                        complaint against us. On contrary, we had been seriously considering
                        suggesting this to him regardless of whether Africans pursued their request
                        for meeting. We feel campaign should be waged, privately and publicly, in
                        order to focus on problem of outside support of rebels and deter supporters
                        of rebel regime from continuing such assistance. Believe it would be
                        particularly useful for Congolese in separate <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> complaint to stress that Communist and radical African
                        intervention on side of rebels constitutes threat to sovereignty, stability
                        and internal security of other African states.</p>

                        integrity and political independence of the Republic of the Congo,” a number

                    <p>The position of the Algerian Government is particularly disturbing in this
                        regard. Not only has the Algerian President publicly announced his country
                        is assisting the rebel movement with arms and men, but planes with Algerian
                        markings have been observed in the Sudan near the Congo border. Moreover,
                        the Government of the Sudan has admitted that certain shipments have been
                        made to the rebels without the approval of the legitimate central Government
                        of the Congo. There is also evidence that the Governments of Ghana and
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss> are involved in providing
                        assistance.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the known political support of the <gloss target="#t_Chicom_1">Chicom</gloss> regime for the rebels, my Government has uncovered
                            <gloss target="#t_Chicom_1">Chicom</gloss> arms and ammunition in the
                        Congo. Moreover, we are disturbed at press reports which indicate that the

                        to help pay for airlift of arms to the Congolese rebels by the United Arab

                        Nigerian to speak up on behalf of <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>.
                        Africans are already divided on Congo, but <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s presence in NY is likely to unite both radicals
                        and moderates in opposition to him as an individual and therefore not be
                        helpful to <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> either in Council or in
                        relationship to broader problem of getting African support against outside
                        intervention.</p>
                    <p>Using whatever argumentation you believe most persuasive, you should seek to
                        dissuade <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> from coming to NY
                        at this time. It seems to us that continued uncertainty regarding success of
                        military operation in eastern Congo is most convincing and acceptable
                        rationale, but, if necessary, you should not hesitate to tell him frankly we
                        believe Congolese case in <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> will be harmed
                        rather than helped by his presence.<note n="5" xml:id="d367fn5">In telegram

                    <p>If these arguments not adequate you should put forward as your personal view
                        on confidential and informal basis, the following: For <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to come US at this time will stir
                        up propaganda and trouble in Africa. Very likely that American Negro and
                        other liberal groups here unsympathetic to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> would engage in demonstrations and publicity adding
                        further to adverse propaganda in Africa. For US most effectively to help
                        Congo, therefore, and in our mutual interest, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> should postpone visit. You should stress this is
                        purely a matter of timing.</p>
                    <p>If in spite of these arguments <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> insists he is coming to New York you should say
                        nothing re prospects of meeting with President, but should inform Dept

                    <p>In addition to personal [<hi rend="italic">personnel</hi>?] matters, covered
                        in a separate memo, the following subjects were discussed:</p>
                    <p>1. The Congo. I told the President that I felt the <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> Government might be in real
                        trouble because of assistance given to the rebels by a number of South
                        African countries, including Algeria, <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss>,
                        Ghana, etc. as well as Communist China and possibly the Soviet Union. This
                        assistance was taking the form of financial aid, military equipment and
                        possibly mercenaries. I indicated that concurrently <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s forces were disintegrating
                        somewhat as mercenary strength was only now about one-half of the peak and
                        air support had reduced substantially. I predicted that we might begin to
                        see <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s forces lose their
                        ground, conceivably Stanleyville and Paulis could be retaken by the rebels
                        and the situation would worsen in the months ahead.</p>
                    <p>I raised the question of our aid to countries, i.e., military air, grants and
                        loans, PL–480 and Peace Corps aid and then witness the countries opposing a
                        legitimate government and criticizing the U.S. policies. The President asked
                        for a report on aid given these countries and the critical statements and
                        positions taken by their leaders.</p>

                        <item><persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>’s Views Concerning
                            Viability of the Current Congo Government</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>(1) <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> is convinced that the
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> government will fall
                        within three months, unless drastic action is taken to enlarge the
                        government. He reasons as follows:</p>
                    <p>(a) The revolt in the Northern and Eastern sections of the Congo is primarily
                        a social revolution and, thus, a revolt which cannot be put down and held
                        down by force alone.</p>
                    <p>(b) The only hope of putting down the revolt is for the Central Government to
                        provide the necessary governmental services for the area.</p>
                    <p>(c) <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> is not an effective
                        administrator and, thus, is not capable, working with his present
                        government, of providing good government in the provinces.</p>
                    <p>(d) <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> is anathema to all other
                        African leaders. Thus, all African states will cooperate, even with the
                        Soviets and Chicoms, to bring down the <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> government.</p>
                    <p>(e) <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> does not have the
                        personal contacts, nor does he have sufficiently clear understanding of
                        African politics to convince the other African leaders to cooperate with his
                        government or, at the very least, to adopt a neutral attitude toward the
                            <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>(2) <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> advised [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] that representatives of various
                        radical African states have urged him to accept the leadership of the
                        rebellion. It is evident from <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>’s statements that he is sorely tempted by this
                        possibility, for it was equally evident that he bitterly resents <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s accession of power. However, the
                        undersigned doubts that <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> will
                        accept such an offer, at least for the present. <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> has always maintained his position as a compromise
                        leader, and it is doubtful that he would wish to accept the leadership of an
                        extremist group. Also, <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> must
                        suspect that such a step on his part would result in his losing the support
                        of the U.S. government. He also must realize that it was the support of the
                        United States government which won for him the premiership in 1961, and <pb n="534" facs="0567" xml:id="pg_534"/>that without U.S.G. support he
                        would have been unable to maintain himself in office for more than a few
                        months. Thus, it is doubtful that <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> would agree to accept a position which would place
                        him in direct conflict with the United States government.</p>
                    <p>(3) Although <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> would dearly love
                        to see <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> fail, he also
                        recognizes that the rebels do not offer a viable alternative. Thus, he
                        recognizes that the fall of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        would contribute to further anarchy within the Congo. He agrees that one
                        possible alternative would be to create a government of public welfare which
                        would include moderate elements not presently in the government.
                        Specifically, he is thinking of himself, <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NAL_1">Ndele</persName>,
                        Kondolo, etc. He believes that if such a government were to be formed, even
                        with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> as premier, it might be
                        feasible to slowly reverse the current situation in the Congo and to achieve
                        a solution to the Congo problem which would be acceptable to other African
                        states. Such a government would be created to carry out the following
                        limited objectives:</p>
                    <p>(a) To revamp the administrative apparatus of the government.</p>
                    <p>(b) To achieve a solution to the current rebellion.</p>
                    <p>(c) To re-establish friendly relations with the other African states.</p>
                    <p>(d) To prepare for free elections.</p>
                    <p>(4) <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> would be willing to enter
                        such a government of public welfare on the following conditions:</p>
                    <p>(a) <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> would have to agree to
                        accept and to work with the moderates added to the government.</p>
                    <p>(b) <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> would agree to enter the
                        government only if President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> were to take the responsibility for appointing him
                        to the government.</p>
                    <p>(c) It would have to be understood that <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>, by entering the government, was not going bond for
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> as an individual.</p>
                    <p>(d) A mechanism would have to be created which would permit the Congo
                        government to locate and hire a core of public administrators to work with
                        Congolese civil servants, to train these Congolese civil servants, and to
                        insure the functioning of effective governmental mechanisms in the
                        provinces.</p>
                    <p>(e) The army must be completely revamped in order to eliminate the
                        incompetent elements.</p>
                    <p>(f) United States government would have to maintain pressures on <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to insure that the latter would
                        not sabotage the efforts of the government of public welfare.</p>
                    <p>(g) Similarly, the United States government should guarantee to provide
                        financial support for <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> and
                        other moderates. <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> recognizes
                        that should a government of public welfare be successful, it might well
                        guarantee the continuation of power of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. However, he believes that continued financial
                        support for other moderates would <pb n="535" facs="0568" xml:id="pg_535"/>be necessary in order to convince <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> that he must cooperate with all moderate groups.</p>

                    <p>1. In aftermath of Stan recapture, and with ref as backdrop, mtg was held 2
                        Dec to discuss question of elections and support to pol parties. Present
                        were [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>], his deputy, [Embassy]
                        pol section chief, [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>], [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]. [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>] asked [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] to
                        summarize discussions and consensus arrived at. Foll is draft which [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] prepared. [Embassy] still pondering draft
                        but eventually presumably will send it or revised version in through its own
                        channels:</p>
                    <p>A. National elections are scheduled to be held during the first half of
                        February 1965. However, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s
                        enemies and even some of his warmest supporters have often suggested that
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> does not intend to have
                        elections at all. In discussing the importance of holding elections on
                        schedule, [Embassy] officers pointed out that the institution of parliament
                        has in the past served as a valuable safety valve for radical and eccentric
                        politicians, and that it would be particularly important now, when the main
                        military effort of the rebels seems to be crushed, to further take the wind
                        out of their sails by offering to the electorate a means whereby they might
                        peacefully change their leaders rather than be obliged to risk their lives
                        for this purpose.</p>
                    <p>B. It will probably not be possible to have elections in some areas of the
                        Congo by mid-February because local pockets of rebels will still not have
                        been mopped up yet. (This holds true for the Kwilu area as well as for the
                        Northeast Congo). However, it is thought that the very fact of <pb n="536" facs="0569" xml:id="pg_536"/>offering an opportunity for elections in
                        liberated areas might hasten the collapse of these pockets.</p>
                    <p>C. We believe that the [Embassy] should use its influence with Congolese
                        authorities to see that elections in fact are held at about the time they
                        have been scheduled. At the same time, we believe that no material support
                        should be provided to the competing political parties for election purposes,
                        and that we should concert with our German and Belgian friends to pursue a
                        like policy. One reason for refraining from such support is that we still do
                        not know what political constellation is favored by <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, nor which by <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>, the leading contenders for the
                        two top jobs under the new constitution. We do have a collection of moderate
                        provincial party groupings, such as <gloss target="#t_PSA_1">PSA</gloss>/<persName corresp="#p_KCL_1">Kamitatu</persName>, Unimo
                        (also Azimo)/<persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName>, Puna/<persName corresp="#p_BJE_1">Bolikango</persName>, Abako/<persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>, Conakat/<persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, Luka/Delvaux, etc, which have
                        already begun to solicit large sums of money for use in holding party
                        congresses and in dispensing election propaganda.</p>
                    <p>D. With little more than two months to go before elections, it seems unlikely
                        that any new national party will be able to make an impact on the
                        electorate, and the results of the elections will probably be favorable to
                        the regionally-based groupings. At least this appears to be the way
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> is betting, and
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> too, to judge from his
                        lack of effort to organize a national party. It would appear that both
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> believe they will be able to
                        dominate the electoral college sufficiently to ensure their election to the
                        two top jobs. We believe that both these gentlemen are astute enough
                        politicians that they will probably be able in fact to dominate the
                        college.</p>
                    <p>2. No index.<note n="3" xml:id="d371fn3">In his monthly dispatch to <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, December 31, the Chief of Station
                            commented that one major problem with which the Station would have to
                            come to grips in the next few months was the solution of the political
                            problem posed by the rebellion. The U.S. Government should insist
                            insofar as it was in its power that elections should be held on schedule
                            in February 1965, and the Station should stand ready to assist a broad,
                            national, moderate, pro-Western coalition at election time. But for the
                            time being the Station was refraining from dealing with individual
                            elements which might eventually make up such a coalition in the hope
                            that the several elements may recognize the necessity of rallying around
                            an acceptable national leader. The Station wanted to avoid enabling
                            regional political figures to hold out against such a coalition since
                            the urgent need at the time was for unity. (Central Intelligence Agency

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA_1">McCone</persName> began by saying that the
                        estimate of the situation in the Congo is a dreary one; that the government
                        forces have a very tenuous hold on Stanleyville, that the main mercenary
                        force is surrounded at Paulis, and that other government forces are under
                        heavy attack in Uvira and Albertville. He informed the Group that the amount
                        of arms and ammunition to the rebels thus far has been 25 plane loads, or
                        about 175 tons plus “volunteers.” He stated that these arms alone may not be
                        sufficient to swing the military balance, but that the arrival of trained
                        ground forces could and that the government position would deteriorate
                        rapidly unless additional military assistance is provided to the Congolese
                        forces. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA_1">McCone</persName> suggested that we
                        should investigate ways to interdict these supplies.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA_1">McCone</persName> said that he had just come
                        from a meeting with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>, who is of the opinion that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s broadening his government at
                        this time would not accomplish much, but that additional programs to provide
                        services to liberated areas are desperately needed.</p>
                    <p>The Group generally discussed the pros and cons of using aid in other
                        countries as a lever to obtain more support for the <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> government and to stop the flow of
                        arms to the rebels. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWS_1">Gaud</persName>
                        informed the Group that <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> continually
                        reviews existing programs and reminded the Group that there are other issues
                        in Africa which must be considered. The Group expressed its appreciation of
                        the fine job that <pb n="539" facs="0572" xml:id="pg_539"/><gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has done and is still doing to
                        counteract the violent statements of the radical nations and to present the
                        true picture of brutality and atrocities.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> noted that
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> is unpopular even with
                        our best friends in Africa and that the job now is to get <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to work with other political
                        parties, indicating that he is prepared to hold elections. He expressed the
                        hope that additional assistance would provide <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> with time to work out a solution. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA_1">McCone</persName> warned that to lose the Congo to
                        the Communists would be like a “cancerous growth which would soon spread.”
                        He suggested that we provide additional B–26’s of a later model to replace
                        the poorly maintained B–26’s presently in the Congo. The Group strongly
                        supported Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA_1">McCone</persName>’s
                        recommendation for additional B–26’s.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Rowan</persName> agreed that we must take
                        steps to prevent the fall of the Congo into Communist hands and asked what
                        we are prepared to do if the “volunteers” do appear in sizeable numbers. He
                        warned that if the presence of the “volunteers” threatens the legitimate
                        Government of the Congo, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        might well ask for US military assistance.</p>

                    <p>1381. For Ambassador from <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName>.
                        Request you deliver following personal oral message from me to <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> soonest:</p>
                    <p>I have very carefully re-examined our proposals for the addition of a
                        cease-fire appeal to the Usher resolution<note n="2" xml:id="d374fn2">Telegram 2247 from <gloss target="#t_USUN_1">USUN</gloss>, December 17,
                            transmitted the text of a draft U.N. resolution given to <persName corresp="#p_YCW_1">Yost</persName> by Ivory Coast’s Representative
                            to the United Nations, Arsene Assouan Usher. (Ibid.) On December 28, a
                            revised version of this draft was submitted to the Security Council by
                            Usher and Ambassador Dey Ould Sidi Baba of Morocco. (U.N. Doc.
                            S/6123)</note> in light of your comments today.</p>
                    <pb n="540" facs="0573" xml:id="pg_540"/>
                    <p>I gather we agree in principle that a cease-fire would, on balance, be
                        advantageous to us especially if it could be effectively policed. I regret
                        we have not had more time for full consultations on this point, but we now
                        are faced with an immediate deadline in New York with great pressure among
                        the delegations to get home for the Christmas holidays which offers an
                        opportunity to get this important point across quickly. My major concern in
                        suggesting this addition is to consolidate the <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> victory in the northeast Congo before the inevitable
                        erosion sets in.</p>
                    <p>Reports from Leopoldville including our most recent talks with De <persName corresp="#p_KCD_1">Kerchove</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_VCF_1">Van der Walle</persName> indicate the <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> has reached the end of forward thrust and is holding too
                        thinly everywhere to permit confidence it can resist a growing rebel
                        counterattack. You appreciate as well as I that adequate reinforcements for
                            <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> are not quickly available now,
                        while men and supplies appear to be pouring in to the rebels.</p>
                    <p>Thus, it seems imperative to erect a political umbrella over Congo which will
                        help forestall rebel recapture of a solid base for a competing government.
                        The cease-fire seems best suited for this purpose. While covert rebel
                        operations may be difficult to observe, they will have to come out in the
                        open if they are to attack towns.</p>
                    <p>I am most sympathetic to your concern lest foisting a cease-fire resolution
                        on <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> without conditioning him
                        lead to a violent reaction. However, we believe that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> back in Leopoldville must be
                        getting the same gloomy picture that we have. So <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> and I are confident that we can
                        quickly show <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> the wisdom of
                        this tactic. In the last analysis, however, can we afford to bargain with
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> over a move which we
                        think so essential?</p>
                    <p>In sum, I believe that the clear advantages of getting on to a political
                        negotiating basis and putting the onus on the rebels and their supporters
                        outweigh the valid risks you cite. To wait might be to lose this
                        opportunity, or to have to try for a cease-fire later when our position is
                        visibly deteriorating and it will be interpreted as showing weakness.</p>
                    <p>We will not go ahead unless you concur, but I hope you will join us in
                        assuming the risks. We have much to gain and relatively little to lose. <hi rend="italic">End message</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Regarding some of <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName>’s specific
                        concerns on Usher resolution, we have following comments:</p>
                    <p>1) Present text does not inhibit freedom of movement of <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>; believe it would be mistake to raise
                        this issue in res since doing so would appear to call <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>’s competence this regard into
                        question.</p>
                    <p>2) <gloss target="#t_Re_1">Re</gloss> mercenaries (operative para 4 of Usher
                        draft), Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YCW_1">Yost</persName> believes we
                        can get reformulation which will not be troublesome based on <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s earlier agreement discharge
                        mercenaries as soon <pb n="541" facs="0574" xml:id="pg_541"/>as possible.
                        (Believe our respective <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Dels should be
                        given flexibility this point.)</p>
                    <p>3) <gloss target="#t_Re_1">Re</gloss> alleged problem of abandoning <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> responsibility to <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>, we could meet this by reformulation of cease-fire
                        paragraph to read “calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities and
                        requests <gloss target="#t_UNSYG_1">UNSYG</gloss>, in concert with <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>, to develop urgently appropriate machinery
                        to assure observance cease-fire and report to <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> as soon as possible.”</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> should realize there now
                        likelihood <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> will introduce
                        condemnatory resolution. This underscores increased importance that moderate
                        Africans have viable alternative which Usher would be willing press.
                        (Moroccan Del has just told us sponsors of <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> complaint will not agree Usher should introduce his
                        resolution unless it is strengthened and will otherwise request Soviets
                        introduce condemnatory res.) In our judgment addition cease-fire element
                        provides that necessary additional attraction.</p>
                    <p>Request you draw on all your well-known persuasiveness to get <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> signed on to this cease-fire
                        operation, to which we attach both long-term strategic as well as immediate
                        tactical importance.</p>
                    <p>If and only if your best efforts in this regard fail to bring <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> around, our ultimate fallback, which
                        you should give him only as last resort would read as follows:</p>

                    <p>McGB:</p>
                    <p>State is more relaxed this morning about the possibility of new military
                        outbreaks which we had feared might take place in the next couple of days in
                        the Congo. However, the situation in Bukavu is still serious and <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> has told his people to do as much as
                        possible to get the missionaries out of the area lest we lose more hostages
                        to the rebels.</p>
                    <p>In New York Usher has just received instructions from Houphouet-Boigny to
                        table a resolution including the cease-fire if he thinks he has eight <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> votes.<note n="2" xml:id="d375fn2">In

                            to the rebels was not stopped. The U.S. Government thought that the
                            cease-fire would make it possible to stop aid to the rebels by
                            establishing <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> and U.N. inspection

                    <p>JCSM–1071–64</p>
                    <list type="subject">
                        <head>SUBJECT</head>
                        <item>Congo Cease Fire</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>1. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have noted that certain political actions are
                        being discussed in attempting to improve the situation in the Congo. These
                        actions are intended to encourage constructive actions by many nations,
                        including the Congo, and to explore the possibilities of an effective
                        cease-fire agreement.</p>
                    <p>2. The Joint Chiefs of Staff agree that political solutions to the Congo
                        problem are needed to supplement security operations, and that constructive
                        efforts to bring about a cessation of hostilities could be advantageous.
                        They are concerned, however, that implementation of a cease-fire could
                        provide the environment for a substantial military advantage accruing to
                        communist inspired and supported forces and thus could preclude attainment
                        of favorable political objectives. Specifically, they do not agree with that
                        portion of a draft United Nations resolution which calls for withdrawal of
                        the mercenaries. Rebel forces will gain an immediate advantage if the
                        cease-fire requires such withdrawal, the withdrawal of US aircraft, or
                        decreases other Western support of the Congolese Government. This advantage
                        will be compounded if radical African states are enabled to continue
                        furnishing arms and advisors to the rebels. Under these circumstances, the
                        United States would eventually be faced with a choice between acceptance of
                        a communist supported victory or extensive US military involvement.</p>
                    <p>3. It should also be recognized that a cease-fire agreement could be
                        construed as according legitimacy and recognition to the rebels. Further,
                        experiences in Laos, Vietnam, and Yemen give evidence of communist and
                        radical tactics of utilizing cease-fire agreements to their advantage.</p>
                    <p>4. The Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that political negotiations will have
                        the best chance for success if they are conducted against a back-ground of
                        military advantage in the Congo. Specifically, they believe that the Congo
                        military situation should be characterized by:</p>
                    <p>a. Congolese Army control of principal cities, towns, and communications
                        points now held.</p>
                    <pb n="544" facs="0577" xml:id="pg_544"/>
                    <p>b. Continued strengthening of the Congolese forces with the required
                        mercenaries, military matériel, and air support, both tactical and
                        airlift.</p>
                    <p>c. A demonstrable ability to make rebel resupply by communist aligned
                        countries costly and ineffective and to deal effectively with any rebel
                        counterattack.</p>
                    <p>5. A CINCSTRIKE/USCINCMEAFSA appraisal of the Congo situation is currently
                        being considered and will be the subject of separate action by the Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff. Meanwhile, they recommend that the Secretary of State be
                        advised of their concern that a cease-fire in the Congo could result in a
                        net advantage to rebel forces unless:</p>
                    <p>a. The military base of the <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        government continues to be strengthened.</p>
                    <p>b. Appropriate military force is available to enforce cessation of any
                        serious rebellious activity in the Congo.</p>
                    <p>c. The effective interdiction of arms traffic to the rebels and the denial of
                        rebel safe-havens is assured.</p>
                    <p>d. Effective nonradical inspection machinery is established in the Congo and
                        surrounding countries.</p>
                    <p>e. The political strategy has the concurrence in advance of the Belgian and
                        Congolese Governments.</p>

                    <p>2519. 1. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> called in Belgian
                        Chargé Puttevils and myself this afternoon to officially inform us that
                        after long consideration by “President and Cabinet,” <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> had decided it could not go along with
                        cease-fire as proposed in <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> resolution.
                        Puttevils quickly told <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> he
                        had message from <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> (text of
                        which we repeating separately) which urged <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> accept resolution but leave to <gloss target="#t_SYG_1">SYG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> responsibility for
                        working out concrete proposal, during which time <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> would reserve full freedom. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName>’s principal point was that rebels would have to lay
                        down arms first and then allow GDG freedom of movement in rebel-held
                        territory.</p>
                    <p>2. I told Prime Minister that I had no instructions on points raised in
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName>’s memo but in line with
                        memo could envisage procedure whereby combined effect of statements by
                        Western members of <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> plus statement of
                        intention by <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_Rep_1">Rep</gloss> would establish interpretation of
                        resolution which would make it possible for <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> accept. Explained this often is done in <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss>, as resolution is only what members of
                        Council say it is.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> listened carefully and
                        then repeated all arguments against cease-fire which he had used with me on
                        Thursday and as recorded (ourtel 2512).<note n="2" xml:id="d377fn2">See <ref target="#d375fn2">footnote 2, Document 375</ref>.</note> Both
                        Puttevils and I tried to combat these arguments, urging him to be
                        forthcoming with both Western members of <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss>
                        and moderate Africans in New York. To no avail.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> said firm decision had
                        been taken by <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> to ask US and other
                        friends of Congo in <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> amend resolution to
                        eliminate cease-fire plus certain other objectional points (mercenaries),
                        and if this not possible not to support resolution. <hi rend="italic">Note:</hi>
                        <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> working on basis text I had
                        given him Thursday, not actual draft tabled by IC and Morocco. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> said he wanted <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss>
                        to realize that <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> took very grave view
                        of cease-fire proposal and, even as explained by <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName>, it not acceptable. Mere use of
                        words “cease-fire” imply legal existence of two parties. He insisted again
                        and again that proposal had been given most serious consideration but said
                            <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> must not underestimate dangers which would stem from
                        passage of <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> resolution embodying
                        cease-fire. He then gave us both copies of <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> memo <pb n="546" facs="0579" xml:id="pg_546"/>on subject,
                        which being repeated by septel.<note n="3" xml:id="d377fn3">Not
                            found.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> reminded us that he had
                        successfully fought proposal for cease-fire in Addis long and knew what
                        radical Africans had in mind when they proposed this measure. Nothing which
                        US or other might say in <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> would change
                        fact that radical Africans and other enemies of Congo would put
                        interpretation on resolutions unfavorable to Congo and would use cease-fire
                        to build up rebels.</p>
                    <p>5. Since it clear after more argument that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> adamant in rejecting cease-fire, I urged him
                        instruct Idzumbir to make statement in <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss>
                        which would emphasize all the positive things <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> [garble—and?] he had said publicly about <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>’s program for national reconciliation.
                        Also urged him instruct Idzumbir work closely with <gloss target="#t_USUN_1">USUN</gloss> and Belgian Del in drafting <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> statement to <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss>, so that

                    </list>
                    <p>1. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have reviewed an appraisal of the Congo
                        situation which was provided by CINCSTRIKE/USCINC-MEAFSA by letter, dated 18
                        December 1964, and supplemented by message <gloss target="#t_STRCC_1">STRCC</gloss> 1294/64, 25 December 1964. A copy of the letter and the
                        appraisal are attached as Appendix C hereto.<note n="2" xml:id="d379fn2">None of the attachments is printed.</note> His principal
                        recommendations are as follows:</p>
                    <p>a. Joint US-Belgian agreement on programs to be developed, responsibilities
                        of each country, and the assistance they will press for from other
                        Western-oriented countries, primarily <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>b. Western support of improved and expanded Congolese Armed Forces to include
                        an increased mercenary force.</p>
                    <p>c. Strongest possible diplomatic, political, and economic measures against
                        nations providing support to the rebels.</p>
                    <p>d. [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>e. [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>f. Initiation of large scale social, economic, and cultural programs in the
                        Congo.</p>
                    <p>2. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that actions such as those proposed by
                        CINCSTRIKE/USCINCMEAFSA would be required to attain US objectives of
                        insuring the Congo’s pro-Western orientation, preventing communist
                        infiltration and maintaining Congolese unity. At the same time, they
                        recognize that these proposals are inconsistent with stated US desires of
                        limiting US involvement in the Congo, keeping the cold war out of Africa,
                        and placing principal reliance on former metropole countries. In effect,
                        CINCSTRIKE/USCINCMEAFSA has formulated his proposals in a manner which leads
                        to the following important questions concerning US cold war strategy and US
                        policies toward all of Africa:</p>
                    <p>a. Should the United States concentrate resources in support of pro-Western
                        governments and in opposition to forces attempting to destroy or subvert
                        such governments?</p>
                    <p>b. With respect to key countries, such as Egypt, Algeria, Ghana, and South
                        Africa, what changes in US policy and courses of action <pb n="549" facs="0582" xml:id="pg_549"/>should be initiated to protect US interests
                        in Africa generally and the Congo in particular?</p>
                    <p>3. Faced with such important policy questions, the serious threat to the
                        Congo’s security, and the aggressive anti-American actions of radical
                        African states, the Joint Chiefs of Staff conclude that two action programs
                        should be initiated without delay:</p>
                    <p>a. An intensive high-level State/Defense reappraisal of US cold war strategy
                        and US policies toward Africa should be accomplished to include a political
                        assessment of the Congo problem and of the threat this poses to US
                        interests. It should be initialed [<hi rend="italic">initiated</hi>] and
                        completed urgently because of the rapid deterioration of Western influence
                        in Africa and because events in the Congo are leading toward deepening US
                        involvement in a difficult politico-military situation. Additional views on
                        such a reappraisal are contained in Appendix A hereto and in JCSM–775–64,
                        dated 5 September 1964, subject: “US Policy Toward Africa.”</p>
                    <p>b. If this reappraisal results in a firm policy decision to take positive
                        political and military action in support of the Congolese Government, the
                        United States and Belgium should consider, in conjunction with the Congo and
                        other Western nations, appropriate steps to strengthen the military base of
                        the <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> Government. Supporting
                        rationale and specific views are contained in Appendix B hereto and in
                        JCSM–756–64, dated 1 September 1964, subject: “Internal Security of the
                            Congo.”<note n="3" xml:id="d379fn3"><ref target="#d245">Document
                                245</ref>.</note> Meanwhile, current efforts should be continued to
                        assist the Congo to counter the communist-supported rebel threat.</p>
                    <p>4. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have also reviewed a letter, dated 18 November
                        1964, from CINCSTRIKE/USCINCMEAFSA in which he recommended that early
                        consideration be given to establishing negotiations with Belgium, Italy, and
                        the Congo to define an appropriate program for providing air support for the
                        Congolese Army. A copy of his letter, including a study entitled “Concept
                        for the Employment of Congolese Air Capability,” is attached as Appendix D
                        hereto. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that:</p>
                    <p>a. Decisions resulting from the aforementioned reappraisal should be reached
                        before long-range plans for the Congolese Air Force are completed.</p>
                    <p>b. Action should be taken, however, to arrest the deterioration of present
                        Congolese air capabilities and to improve effectiveness. To this end,
                        discussions should be initiated with the Belgians, Italians, and Congolese
                        along these lines. Such discussions should not prejudice courses of action
                        which might result from the reappraisal outlined in subparagraph 3 a, above.
                        Appropriate US military personnel should be included as participants in
                        these discussions.</p>
                    <pb n="550" facs="0583" xml:id="pg_550"/>
                    <p>5. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend early initiation of the actions
                        suggested in paragraphs 3 and 4, above. In this connection, the Joint Chiefs
                        of Staff on 5 September 1964 advised that they considered it timely and
                        prudent to reappraise our objectives and policy in Africa in the light of
                        developing communist strategy and tactics. While the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        are aware that studies treating aspects of this problem have been initiated,
                        it does not appear that these will constitute the concentrated
                        interdepartmental effort to conduct a substantive reappraisal of US
                        objectives toward Africa which they believe to be required. They continue to
                        be seriously concerned over the deterioration of US national security
                        interests and the lack of a common policy with regard to Africa and
                        accordingly request your personal support in initiating the reappraisal,
                        which should be characterized by such stature and authority that it can, if
                        necessary, lead to major and prompt changes in US cold war strategy and US
                        policies toward Africa.</p>

                    <p>We are trying our best to get some kind of a political umbrella erected over
                        the <hi rend="italic">Congo</hi>, to help forestall a rebel
                        counter-offensive and to protect us against military overcommitment. Since
                        the Northeast Congo is really being held by only 110 mercenaries, supported
                        by a peanut airforce, we are greatly worried lest outside aid to the rebel
                        remnants lead to a counter-offensive which could even retake Stanleyville.
                        The Belgians, especially <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName>, feel
                        the same way. They and we are also doing what we can to help <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> beef up his forces (he’s
                        recruiting his own mercenaries) but we doubt they could hold if rebels
                        started using mercenaries too.</p>
                    <p>During <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName>’s trip to Europe,
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> proposed that we both try
                        to get <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> back into touch with the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>. Since we want an “African” political
                        solution, or at least an extended negotiation in lieu of renewed fighting,
                        we’re inclined to favor this course. However, it may require some pressure
                        on <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to get him to make the
                        necessary gestures to get more African states on his side. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> will work on <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> when he comes to Brussels next
                        week.</p>
                    <p>At the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Council, <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> seemed to make a dent in urging our allies (except
                        for the French) to join us in supporting the Congo regime. <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> himself did rather better in
                        London; we can probably count on more <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>
                        help in weaning the East Africans away from the radical Arabs and <persName corresp="#p_NKW_1">Nkrumah</persName>.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> gets back today at 4. You
                        might want to get a brief report directly from him. If not, you might want a
                        half-hour meeting on the Congo sometime next week to brief you on our
                        strategy. I have my fingers crossed on this one, but I now see a 50/50
                        chance that we’ll be <pb n="553" facs="0586" xml:id="pg_553"/>able to
                        disengage somewhat from the Congo and get it off the crisis list, while

                        suggested after considerable discussion that <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> do everything possible covertly to stimulate and incite
                        resentment on the part of the Black Africans against the Muslim slave
                        traders of Egypt, Algeria and elsewhere in the Middle East and that
                        conversely incite resentment among the Muslims over supplying arms to the
                        Black Africans which would ultimately be used against the Muslim population
                        in the Sudan. <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> stated that it
                        was his understanding that one convoy of arms from Khartoum to the Congo had
                        been taken over by the Sanu tribesmen and would be used in the Sudan
                        conflict.</p>

                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> said that he was informed
                        that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NKW_1">Nkrumah</persName> were in contact with one another.
                        This information had come from <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Wayne
                            Fredericks</persName>. I said I knew of no such contact. <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> said he thought that perhaps this
                        information had not gotten up to me.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Action:</hi> I wish to be informed, to review the

                    <p>7. At the close of the meeting, Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> came in, having just arrived from Europe, and
                        reported briefly on his talks in Paris, purpose of which was to insist upon
                        European participation in the Congo and other African problems. He
                        apparently leveled pretty heavily on the British to use their influence with
                        the East African states. Stated that <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> handled the meeting in superb fashion. I asked
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> what he meant by
                        “twisting <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s arm”—what did he
                        expect <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to do? He retorted
                        “write to the Emporer” (presumably Haille Salassie).</p>

                        questions and comments in the border. In answer to my question, the
                        Secretary said that the Brief was extremely useful, very well done, and he
                        hoped we would continue it in its present form.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the Congo, I stated to the Secretary that I felt we had no
                        choice except to insure victory for <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, that I thought the covert support we were giving
                        had turned the tide of the battle in the last 2 weeks and if we continued
                        our help, we had a good chance of stabilizing the situation within 60 to 90
                        days. I said we should not be deterred from this by the persuasion of
                        do-gooders, by reactions from African states in the United Nations who
                        didn’t like us anyway, or from the vote in the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> said he
                        agreed completely and that he felt that once <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> had established control, the attitude of the
                        neighboring African states, which was now antagonistic, would change. I
                        concurred, stating this had been my viewpoint right along. <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> who entered the meeting somewhat
                        later, however, expressed the view that “<persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> would be cut to pieces” by rebels assisted by the
                        soldiers of a great many of the antagonistic African states supplied with
                        modern weapons from China and the Soviet Union. I intend to discuss this
                        matter in depth with <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> next
                        week.</p>

                    <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> stated that he had been
                        informed that Kanza, rebel Foreign Minister, had been approached by
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and was to come over to
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. I pointed out that
                        Kanza had been associated with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> until <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> took over as <gloss target="#t_PM_1">PM</gloss>. I
                        said that we had reports that Kanza and <persName corresp="#p_GCH_1">Gbenye</persName> had split, that I could not verify the rapprochement

                    <p>I very much fear that we’re in the eye of the storm over the Congo. The
                        present deceptive lull strikes me as most likely a buildup period, during
                        which those aiding the rebels are preparing a major counter-offensive to
                        retake Congo Orientale. Given the thin screen of mercenaries and peanut
                        airforce which is all that’s really between the rebels and Stanleyville, the
                        rebels could probably retake it with “volunteer” support.</p>
                    <p>Such a counter-thrust would present us with a cruel dilemma. We probably
                        couldn’t stop it without a much larger Belgian/US or other military
                        commitment than at present. Equally bad, it would split Africa, forcing us
                        to put great pressure on the radical supporters of the rebels, unless we
                        were willing to see the <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> lose. So we
                        would face either a major setback to our Congo policy (and our prestige as
                        well) or greater involvement in the Congo with all the costs involved.</p>
                    <p>These alternatives are both so unpalatable as to justify an all-out effort to
                        forestall a new Congo flareup by promoting some kind of political <pb n="556" facs="0589" xml:id="pg_556"/> settlement. From our standpoint a
                        political track, tricky as it might be, is infinitely preferable to a
                        military one. Since we <hi rend="italic">don’t</hi> want to get more
                        entangled in the Congo, we want if possible an <hi rend="italic">African</hi> political solution (which means the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>), with the US disengaging to the extent
                        feasible without sacrificing the <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>.
                        What are the key elements?</p>
                    <p>1. First, we want to erect as many <hi rend="italic">political barriers</hi>
                        as possible to rebel counterattack. At the moment the <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> hold most key centers in the Northeast
                        Congo. For this reason we saw a UNSC cease-fire resolution as putting the
                        onus on the rebels if they started to attack again. Building on the <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> resolution, and its 10 September 1964 <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> precursor, we must try to isolate the
                        rebels and their supporters politically, and lay the ground-work for charges
                        of violation and “aggression” against a rebel counterattack.</p>
                    <p>2. Second, we need to get some kind of conciliation or mediatory effort
                        going, so that if the rebels attack again, they are undermining this. If we
                        can get an <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> majority moving in this
                        direction, it’s worth the risk.</p>
                    <p>3. Third, we want to <hi rend="italic">reinforce the political
                            legitimacy</hi> of the <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> by getting
                        it to improve its acceptability in Africa. This involves a whole series of
                        action we’d like the <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> to
                        undertake—de-emphasis of South African mercenaries, broadening the cabinet,
                        elections, etc.</p>
                    <p>Our problem on all three counts is the reluctance of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> to take actions which seem to them to show
                        weakness. They also suspect that these moves mask a US/Belgian
                        disengagement. We must first try to get their confidence and overcome these
                        suspicions. If this fails, then pressures are essential, since without them
                        we’ll be in the soup again.</p>
                    <p>Shouldn’t we develop a more systematic plan of action to carry out all these
                        aims? I know that we’re doing many of them ad hoc already, but we need a
                        more systematic and coordinated approach. Moreover, desirable as it is to
                        hide behind the Africans, I doubt that they will be self-starters. We’ll
                        have to cajole and prod them even at risk of showing our hand.</p>
                    <p>In sum, my real fear is that unless we can draw some political umbrella over
                        the Congo soon, we’re either going to be sucked into another war, or have to
                        retreat ignominiously. I realize that I’m only illuminating the problem, not
                        offering concrete solutions. But I have a number of further suggestions on a
                        political track, which I’ll come discuss with you.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>Following the Special Group <gloss target="#t_CI_1">CI</gloss> Meeting, I met
                        with Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> to discuss
                        U.S. policy objectives in the Congo.</p>
                    <p>At the <gloss target="#t_CI_1">CI</gloss> meeting I had read [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]<note n="2" xml:id="d385fn2">Not found.</note> noting particularly the agenda items
                        3a. through d., all of which were directed against the United States and
                        indicated a fear of an attack on East African states by the Congolese.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> stated that in his
                        discussions with representatives of Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya that a very
                        great concern had been expressed that if the Congo situation was cleaned up
                        by large numbers of South African mercenaries under <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, they would continue on into the
                        East African states as means of disrupting them and thus stop the southward
                        trend of the independent Black African movement. They predict that the South
                        African mercenaries would be heavily supported by the Portuguese and would
                        not be manageable by <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. It is
                        this attitude which Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> feels represents a real and sincere fear that
                        influences the anti-<persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> attitude
                        in many African states, particularly the East African states.</p>
                    <p>I reported to <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> the Rebels had
                        received 39 plane loads of matériel from the North and had established three
                        training and training-holding centers in Southern Sudan and were moving arms
                        by motor trucks from the Sudan into the Congo. I stated several convoys had
                        been intercepted, one involving 18 trucks had been destroyed and some
                        apparently had turned around under orders from the Sudan Government, but
                        nevertheless, the Rebels were being supplied and we expected this to
                        continue. Furthermore, Chinese arms had come into the Burundi via Dar es
                        Salaam, but these had been impounded by orders of the King of Burundi, and
                        as far as we know had not reached the Congo.</p>
                    <p>I stated there is no evidence of Malian, Algerian or Egyptian “mercenaries”
                        operating in the Congo with the Rebels. There are unconfirmed reports of
                        Algerian and Ghanaian fighters in Brazzaville, but this had not been
                        confirmed. Also reports of Chinese and Soviet arms in Brazzaville, but these
                        also had not been confirmed.</p>
                    <pb n="558" facs="0591" xml:id="pg_558"/>
                    <p>Referring to the U.S. policy objectives I expressed no disagreement with the
                        objectives stated in the attached paper of 13 January,<note n="3" xml:id="d385fn3">Attached but not printed is a paper entitled “U.S.

                        therefore <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> must win.</p>
                    <p>I then reviewed the 13 January comments on some aspects of the U.S. policy,
                        emphasizing each one of the points made in the attached paper.<note n="4" xml:id="d385fn4">Attached but not printed is a paper entitled “Comments
                            on Some Aspects of Current U.S. Tactical Policy Objectives in the

                        <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> questioned me concerning
                        the number of mercenaries and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KTH_1">Karamessines</persName> responded by stating that in an itemized list
                        as of 10 days ago, there were some 220 South Rhodesian, South African types,
                        200 Belgian and other Europeans and en route now are 60 Belgian and other
                        European types with possibly 90 additional, making a total of 150.</p>
                    <p>The following points were agreed upon:</p>
                    <p>1. There is no alternative to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        and we must help him to win.</p>
                    <p>2. It would be in our interest to increase the number of Belgian and European
                        mercenaries and phase out the South Africans.</p>
                    <p>3. Attempts should be made to have <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> give assurances concerning the integrity of East
                        African states and also express his hope that he could dispense with South
                        African mercenaries at the earliest practical time.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Note</hi>: In this connection <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> disagreed with our position that “African opinion
                        opposes White mercenaries from any source,” stating that certain African
                        leaders, including Nyrere had told him that they would not oppose European
                        mercenaries, indeed they would not oppose United States military, but they

                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> spoke of demobilization
                        of several thousand of the French Senegalese Army and raised the question as
                        to whether some of them could not be recruited as mercenaries. He admitted
                        this would create problems for <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> believes that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> should make every gesture to
                        mollify the criticism and proposed such things as a letter from <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> to the Emperor, rapprochement
                        between <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and Holden Roberto,
                        holding the elections as scheduled, and a few other things but none of which
                        would alter <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s position as

                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> is very strong on this
                        point but apparently is having some difficulty within the Department.</p>

                            Capability in the Congo (Leopoldville)</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>1. [<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>] has noted with increasing concern
                        the potential for expansion of the military situation in the Northeast
                        Congo. The radical African states have not only made public declarations of
                        their support for the Congolese rebels, but there are also detailed
                        classified reports delineating the plans and intentions of these states.
                        There are recurring reports of “volunteers” or of specific troop support for
                        the rebels from several African states, notably Kenya, Algeria, and Mali, as
                        well as the <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss>, and possibly from Belgium.
                        The radical African states also have the capability of providing high-speed
                        tactical air support to the Congolese rebels. The <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss> and Algeria, for instance, both have MIGs of various
                        categories at their disposal.</p>
                    <pb n="560" facs="0593" xml:id="pg_560"/>
                    <p>2. [<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>] does not have the capability in the
                        Congo to conduct covert operations of a scope and nature commensurate with
                        opposing high-speed tactical aircraft or concerted military troop support to
                        the rebels.</p>
                    <p>3. Present tactical air support forces in the Congo under the control of
                            [<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>] cannot stand up to high-speed jet
                        aircraft, and if such aircraft are introduced into the Congo, [<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>] would have to withdraw the air support
                        forces under [<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>] control since their
                        continued operations under such conditions would not be feasible.</p>
                    <p>4. [<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>] considers that if such high speed
                        aircraft or extensive troop support are introduced into the Congo conflict,
                        the alternative to withdrawal will be to call upon extensive Belgian
                        support.</p>

                            recommended that the restrictions still in effect on using T–28s and

                        avoid scare stories of US planes massacring civilians from the air (and also

                        would still be off limits). Also rebels know our policy so are travelling at
                        night and holing up in village “safehavens” during day. So there is real
                        need to go after them, if we’re to have a decent chance of holding (we can
                        always change back later). Finally, we’re already so damned that any likely

                    <p>I’m for this, as one of desperate measures to scare off rebels before their

                            is followed by the handwritten notation: “OK. McGB.” Telegram 1831 to
                            Leopoldville, January 18, informed the Embassy that permission was
                            granted, but that pilots should be carefully briefed on the need for
                            careful identification of targets so as to avoid indiscriminate damage
                            to civilians or their property. They should also use great care not to
                            strafe villages within 10 miles of the Uganda border. (Ibid.)</note></p>

                    <p>If the Congo rebellion flares up again, as is all too likely, we’ll almost
                        certainly be under great Congressional and public pressure to cut off any US
                        aid to nations supporting the rebels. Since this will be aggression as
                        defined by the Gruening Amendment, plenty of anti-<persName corresp="#p_NGA_1">Nasser</persName> congressmen will raise a howl. And
                        if we suspend aid to <persName corresp="#p_NGA_1">Nasser</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_BBA_1">Ben Bella</persName> what grounds will we
                        have for not suspending aid to the other countries as well?</p>
                    <p>Ergo, if a confrontation like this is likely to develop anyway, why don’t we
                        use this stick as a threat in an effort to forestall having to apply it in
                        fact? What I have in mind is quietly getting the word around to the <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss>, Algerians, Malians, Sudanese, and East
                        Africans along following lines: If there is another Congo flare-up, openly
                        supported by these countries, the US Congress will almost certainly insist
                        on cutting off aid. The US doesn’t want to do this, but the Administration
                        fears that it would have no choice, since charges of aggression would
                        certainly be brought in the UNSC as well as the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>, and the radicals would be accused of violation of the
                        recent <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> Resolution. The <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> is already touting this line. The <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would deplore such an eventuality, so is
                            <pb n="562" facs="0595" xml:id="pg_562"/>most anxious that the parties
                        concerned move toward some kind of political solution (in line with the
                            <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Resolutions) which will obviate the risk of an open break
                        between the US and the rebel supporters.</p>
                    <p>I am not suggesting that our Embassies should use this as an official line.
                        Rather, this thought could be dropped in casual conversations (thinking out
                        loud about the future), [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] and unofficial channels, e.g. an Edgar Kaiser letter
                        to <persName corresp="#p_NKW_1">Nkrumah</persName>. It seems to me that we
                        must exhaust every recourse to forestall resumption of a rebel offensive.
                        The above idea may not seem terribly persuasive, but it wouldn’t cost us
                        much. If the rebellion flares up we’ll probably have to cut off aid anyway,
                        so why not let this word get around?</p>

                        Chiefs of Staff regarding restrictions imposed by the United States upon the
                        use of air support in military operations in the Congo. Such restrictions
                        were deemed to be militarily unwise and establish a political precedent in
                        which are inherent dangers to adequate US military support of US policies
                        and objectives world-wide. Except for support of the <persName corresp="#p_VCF_1">Van der Walle</persName> attack on Stanleyville in
                        November 1964 and Operation Dragon Rouge, the restrictions remain in
                        effect.</p>
                    <p>2. The situation in the Congo has changed drastically since last October. The
                        state purpose of the restrictions at that time was to protect the rebel-held
                        US hostages. This condition no longer obtains with the rescue of the
                        hostages by the Dragon Rouge/Noir and subsequent operations. <pb n="563" facs="0596" xml:id="pg_563"/> Additionally, the provision of Soviet-made
                        weapons through the Sudan and Uganda is strengthening the rebel forces.
                        Continued restrictions on air operations increasingly jeopardize a
                        satisfactory military conclusion in the Congo and could contribute to the
                        escalation of the present rebellion into a major conflict within Africa.</p>

                    <p>2. With respect to the Congo, <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> mentioned a recent set of recommendations made by
                        General <persName corresp="#p_APD_1">Adams</persName> which are now being
                        held <pb n="564" facs="0597" xml:id="pg_564"/>by the Joint Chiefs, and
                        resulting in the Joint Chiefs directing an inquiry to State, a copy of which
                        the Governor showed me.<note n="2" xml:id="d390fn2">See <ref target="#d389">Document 389</ref>.</note> I said we had not seen the <persName corresp="#p_APD_1">Adams</persName>’ recommendations.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Action:</hi> We should review the <persName corresp="#p_APD_1">Adams</persName>’ recommendations and, at an
                        appropriate time, prepare comments.</p>
                    <p>3. The Governor mentioned there were 500 mercenaries in Europe ready to go to
                        the Congo but the U.S. was not ready to provide transport of their supplies
                        nor to furnish uniforms, etc. I do not know what this problem is. The
                        Governor was vague on details.<note n="3" xml:id="d390fn3">On January 25,
                                <persName corresp="#p_FGD_1">Fields</persName> sent a memorandum to
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRI_1">Helms</persName> commenting on
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName>’s information that
                            some 500 mercenaries were in Europe ready to go to the Congo, but that
                            the United States was not prepared to transport their supplies or
                            furnish uniforms. <persName corresp="#p_FGD_1">Fields</persName> said
                            that mercenaries were currently arriving in the Congo without supplies.
                            He noted that supplies were normally provided by the Belgians and/or
                                <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, but the Belgians
                            were apparently withholding such supplies in an effort to bring pressure
                            on <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to negotiate sensibly
                            on economic and financial matters. <persName corresp="#p_FGD_1">Fields</persName> stated that up until now, it had not been U.S.
                            policy to equip mercenaries, [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>], he did not see where any Agency action was
                            called for. (Central Intelligence Agency Files, Job 78–03805R, <gloss target="#t_DDOIMS_1">DDO/IMS</gloss> Files, Box 1, Area
                            Activity—Africa)</note></p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Action:</hi>
                        <gloss target="#t_DDP_1">DDP</gloss> should check <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi> with State to determine what the problems are and see
                        if we should, and can, help. If not, lend an effort to secure appropriate
                        action by DoD or other Departments of the U.S. Government if action on our
                        part is in order and desired.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> showed me a long message
                        from <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> which he thought was most helpful
                        and which in effect told <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to
                        come to Brussels and settle their problems at once if he were to look for
                        any more help from Belgium. Also he showed me excerpts from a statement that
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> made to the African
                        Ambassador in the Congo which he thought was both constructive and would be
                        most useful.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion of an unrelated subject.]</p>
                    <p>5. [<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (10½ lines) not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (6 lines) not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>6. During the discussion with Gov. <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> I expressed grave misgivings concerning the outcome
                        in the Congo. I referred to the various reports of training in Algeria,
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss>, the Sudan, and, more particularly,
                            [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] the
                        establishment of rebel training camps in Algeria. I said that it was very
                        doubtful in my mind whether the <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> government could win the game unless there was a
                        reversal of attitude of the neighboring States. It appeared to me that
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> himself could not bring
                        about a revision of thought by the Heads of neighboring States; however, if
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> stepped out in front,
                        he might have some effect. Also, if we could publicize the reduction and
                        final elimination of South African mercenaries and the presence <pb n="565" facs="0598" xml:id="pg_565"/> of European mercenaries, this likewise
                        might help. In summary my view was most pessimistic. I gave <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> a copy of our January 19th weekly
                        summary of the Congo. I told him that I thought it should be read by all of
                        those in the Department who were testifying on the Congo prior to the time
                        they made statements. I pointed out <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName>’s statement to the Leadership at the White House was
                        quite in error because it was overly optimistic and this was due to the fact
                        that he had not seen reports, or been briefed. (<hi rend="italic">Note:</hi>
                        In fact, he admitted afterwards he had received no briefing on the Congo for
                        the past two weeks.)</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s desire to
                            cooperate with other African states and to emphasize the following
                            points: 1) <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s firm
                            intention to hold elections in March; 2) the Congolese Government’s
                            willingness to extend “full collaboration” to the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>; 3) his invitation to <persName corresp="#p_KJO_1">Kenyatta</persName> to hold the next Ad Hoc
                            Commission meeting in Leopoldville; and 4) his statement that the

                            resolution. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59,

                        something started. Most important is to <hi rend="italic">get the fighting

                        were demonstrating some evidence of improved operations resulting from
                        training, that there were three sites in the Sudan which we suspected to be
                        rebel training sites, that three training areas in Algeria had been
                        allocated to the rebels, that we could expect an increased rebel vitality in
                        the future. On the other hand, the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>
                        troops were practically worthless unless led by mercenaries and that there
                        is deep trouble with the South African mercenaries. I read the Secretary a
                        cable [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>] (In 67046). At this
                        point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> walked in and we
                        reviewed the cable. After sanitizing it by removing the pseudonyms I left
                        the cable with <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName>, who planned
                        to communicate immediately with the Ambassador, urging that he insist that
                        the problem with the mercenaries over pay and allotments be straightened out
                        at once.</p>

                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> then again asked whether
                        we had any more information on the possibility of MiG’s from the <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss> being flown by [<hi rend="italic">less
                            than 1 line not declassified</hi>] pilots. I said nothing more than I
                        had reported to him on Friday. He then again suggested the prospect of a
                        covert “Chennault Flying Tiger” type of a Congo air force to combat this
                        eventuality. It was agreed on Friday we would do some thinking and planning
                        and perhaps, if appropriate agreement could be reached at policy level, get
                        such a unit in being, but not apply it to the Congo unless and until it was
                        actually needed.</p>

                    <p>After an exchange of greetings and reference to his last meeting with
                        Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> in Geneva in 1961,
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> turned to his recent
                        departure from Leopoldville where he had seen an American negro leader, Mr.
                            Farmer.<note n="2" xml:id="d393fn2">Civil rights leader James
                            Farmer.</note> Mr. Farmer had come to the Congo with distorted
                        impressions but had quickly seen that he had been mistaken. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> had invited Mr. Farmer to visit
                        towns in the interior.</p>
                    <pb n="568" facs="0601" xml:id="pg_568"/>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> referred to the
                        problem of aid from certain African states to the rebels which originated in
                        the Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> replied
                        that several things could be done about this problem. One was the diplomatic
                        offensive in which the U.S. had been helpful. Next were <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s contacts with the King of
                        Burundi who had promised to influence Parliament to change the government.
                        It was bad luck that the Prime Minister was killed just as he was about to
                        normalize relations with the Congo. The new Prime Minister, however, has
                        already seized a large quantity of rebel armament. Next were Congolese
                        efforts among the southern Sudanese who were willing to fight rebel arms
                        traffic. They had already been helpful.</p>
                    <p>In reply to a question about Uganda, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> said he was trying to work with that country; but in
                        any case if he could move his troops to the frontier quickly the frontier
                        could be closed. Tanzania presented a more difficult problem because it was
                        difficult to control traffic across the lake. If the Congo had more military
                        material traffic on the lake it could be controlled.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> asked what could be
                        done to contribute to the diplomatic offensive. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> replied that U.S. could be helpful with its friends
                        as could the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> which had influence in
                        Commonwealth countries. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        observed that there could not be peace in Africa if rebel activities
                        continued. If he wanted to, he said he could himself cause trouble in
                        Uganda.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s opinion of his ex-Ambassador to
                        London, Thomas Kanza. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        replied that Kanza was known as a thief in the Congo. He had taken advantage
                        of contacts made as a Congolese diplomat in order to aid the rebels in East
                        Africa.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> stated that
                            <persName corresp="#p_GCH_1">Gbenye</persName> and Kanza had won a
                        diplomatic victory over him in East Africa and urged that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> should make contacts with the
                        three East African countries which were now opposing the Congo but were
                        perhaps still amenable to persuasion. He also stressed the importance of a
                        Congolese effort to influence the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Ad
                        Hoc Committee which is now meeting in Nairobi to discuss the Congo. In reply
                        to Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName>’s question on
                        why he had not sent a high level representative such as Leguma, he replied
                        that Leguma had declined because he was afraid for his personal security.
                        Instead, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> had sent a bright
                        and dynamic young student from Belgium, Jean Gouza. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> commented that he should not have
                        been fearful of Leguma’s safety as the rebels would have done themselves
                        irreparable damage if they had killed an Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> asked whether
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> personally knew East
                        African leaders such as <persName corresp="#p_OAM_1">Obote</persName>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KJO_1">Kenyatta</persName> and Nyerere. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> had only met Nyerere once but knew
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJO_1">Kenyatta</persName> well. In reply to a
                        question he said his government was about to send an Ambassador to Tanzania.
                            <pb n="569" facs="0602" xml:id="pg_569"/> With regard to the Commission
                        meeting, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> did not know what
                        would happen, but he did not expect much with countries such as Algeria and
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss> participating. Nigeria, he said,
                        had sent a good representative with firm instructions but the Upper Volta,
                        while not opposing the Congo, was influenced by radicals, such as the
                        Algerians, who did all the talking.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> suggested that
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> should spend more effort
                        himself and send special ambassadors to make contacts with African countries
                        which could be influenced.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> said his efforts in French
                        Africa had been very successful. The real problem was in English speaking
                        Africa, but he was encouraged by indications that <persName corresp="#p_NKW_1">Nkrumah</persName> was beginning to modify his
                        position slightly.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> inquired regarding
                        the Congo’s military forces. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        replied that the morale was good but there was a shortage of material. The
                        T–28’s sent by the United States had been a great help but they were not
                        enough. More air power was needed to prevent the kind of ambushing of
                        Congolese forces that had occurred recently. There was also the problem of
                        Belgian officers who were needed for training and whose contracts would
                        expire in three months time. He would discuss this in Brussels. Governor
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> stated that it was
                        better for the Congolese to get their volunteers from Europe rather than
                        South Africa. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> replied that
                        he was trying but it was difficult to find qualified Europeans. Many of the
                        French, for example, were working under better conditions for the King of
                        the Yemen. The Congo had an office in Brussels and the Belgians were not
                        interfering with recruiting but only small numbers were volunteering. In
                        reply to a question <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> said he
                        needed 1,000 volunteers. This would permit him to station some of them in
                        agricultural and mining areas to give confidence to the people and insure
                        security. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> referred
                        to the fact that some volunteers had left the Congo claiming they had not
                        been paid. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> replied that this
                        was true and that malicious propaganda had been circulated among them.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> inquired about
                        plans for the election. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> said
                        he was determined to hold them between the 15th and 31st of March. They
                        would be held province by province so as to insure they would be well
                        regulated and held in a secure atmosphere. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> urged that observers and
                        journalists should be invited from other countries to observe the election
                        and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> agreed. He went on to
                        mention his invitation to Diallo <persName corresp="#p_TBD_1">Telli</persName> who had not come to Leopoldville because of ill
                        health.</p>
                    <p>In reply to Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName>’s
                        question regarding Holden Roberto, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> explained that their relations were now good but
                        that Holden Roberto was having trouble with rival groups backed by the <pb n="570" facs="0603" xml:id="pg_570"/>Algerians and <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss> who were demanding that he leave the
                        Congo. He was also having difficulties with some of his soldiers who were
                        not well paid. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> had told him
                        that he should discuss these problems with him so that he could help to
                        solve them.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> inquired regarding
                        the Congo’s relations with Brazzaville. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> replied that Chinese influence there was very strong
                        and rebel camps were in existence there. In reply to the suggestion that
                        President De Gaulle might exert some influence in Congo Brazzaville,
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> noted that the French
                        were having troubles there too. He did not consider Massamba-Debat to be a
                        real communist but the Foreign Minister Ganao was an out-and-out communist.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> agreed with Governor
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> that President De
                        Gaulle had not served his own or African interests by recognizing Communist
                        China. The Chinese, said <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>,
                        were a greater danger to Africa than the Russians because they were more
                        formidable in numbers and because they used a simple approach that appealed
                        to Africans.</p>
                    <p>In response to Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName>’s
                        suggestion that he present his views re the Congo. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> made the point that the Congo was
                        a particular problem because of its geographic and economic importance. The
                        Congo could be strong and stable under a strong government. Because the
                        people had suffered greatly under communism, they now represented a positive
                        anti-communist force which could be useful in Africa. The Congo could be
                        saved and the Congo’s friends should see to it that it did not fall.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> returned to the
                        suggestion that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> should make
                        an effort to establish useful contacts in East Africa. Although no mention
                        was made of negotiating with the rebels, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> raised this subject. When he had become Prime
                        Minister he had invited rebel leaders to Leopoldville. He had even gone to
                        Bujumbura to see the entourage of <persName corresp="#p_SGE_1">Soumialot</persName> but he had found no representative person to talk
                        to. There was a Congolese public opinion which held <persName corresp="#p_GCH_1">Gbenye</persName> and others responsible for
                        massacres. How could such persons come to Leopoldville?</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> stressed the
                        importance of the Congo’s obtaining a victory in the current <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Ad Hoc Committee session in Nairobi. The
                        Congolese Government’s position, he noted, was the right one and if they
                        made the effort they should be able to establish the responsibility of the
                            <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> to contribute to Congolese
                        stability. It would be a tough fight but <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> had the skill to do it and he also had friends.
                        World public opinion could be brought to his side if elections were held and
                        outsiders invited to observe them. (At the present time President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> represented the legitimacy of the
                        Congolese Government. Until he won an election, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> had his position only from <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>.) It was felt in Washington, he
                        said, that President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>
                        <pb n="571" facs="0604" xml:id="pg_571"/>should write more letters to chiefs
                        of state and make public statements more often. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> replied that he agreed that greater efforts should
                        be made. He noted, however, that it was difficult for President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> to write letters to persons who
                        did not answer the letters or even read them.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> commented that the
                        Emperor of Ethiopia would answer his letters. He observed that the Congo had
                        a good friend in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> and that
                        Belgium could be helpful in ways not open to the U.S.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> asked whether it
                        would not be possible to enlist African military help to replace white
                        volunteers whose presence offended public opinion. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> replied that the only countries in
                        Africa with real armies were the <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss> and
                        Algeria. When asked about the soldiers recently released by the French, he
                        said he was continuing to make efforts to enlist them and that he had some
                        encouragement in Upper Volta, but many of these countries were afraid of the
                        outcry of the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> closed the
                        conversation by assuring Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        that the U.S. wished to help him and the Congo achieve stability and
                        prosperity. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> expressed his
                        thanks and said he very much hoped his friends would not abandon the Congo
                        since its stability and economic progress were essential to the peaceful
                        development of Africa.</p>
                    <p>At this point Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> asked
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> and Senators
                        Fulbright, <persName corresp="#p_HBB_1">Hickenlooper</persName> and Jackson
                        to come in. They were introduced to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and the other Congolese. After an
                        exchange of greetings the Secretary assured Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> of the deep interest of Americans including the
                        President in the well-being of the Congo. He also said he hoped every effort
                        would be made to improve the Congolese image in Africa and the world.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> replied that he agreed
                        entirely with the need for a great effort and he welcomed U.S. support in
                        this regard.</p>

                            thing was to find a way to close out this affair without letting it

                    <dateline><placeName>Washington</placeName>, <date when="1965-02-06" calendar="gregorian">February 6, 1965</date>.</dateline>
                    <p>1667. This tel provides basis for discussion with Belgians of kind of <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> political solution we could both accept
                        and persuade <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> to accept without damage
                        to any of our basic interests. It should be regarded as indicative of our
                        current thinking, not as plan to which we committed in every detail.
                        Moreover, it does not deal with tactics for its implementation, which would
                        be subject subsequent discussions once elements of an acceptable plan were
                        agreed. It also does not deal with actions we should take to get <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to take further steps to improve
                        his relations with <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> and African leaders.
                        (We attach great importance to this aspect and believe, for example, that it
                        would be useful for him to contact not only moderate leaders but also
                            <persName corresp="#p_NKW_1">Nkrumah</persName> to take advantage of
                        possible favorable developments.)</p>
                    <p>Combination of circumstances now exists offering reasonable opportunity for
                        political settlement in Congo consonant with <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>’s basic interests and not inimical those of <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> and US. Main elements these circumstances
                        are: (1) <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>’s position of relative
                        military strength vis-à-vis rebels and (2) new initiative by <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Congo Commission to cooperate with <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> in dealing with Congo problem.</p>
                    <p>Failure of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to exploit present
                        generally favorable circumstances would leave him with no alternative but to
                        seek additional military aid to suppress rebellion strengthened by
                        continuing assistance from radical Africans (and indirectly from
                        Communists), thus raising problem escalation. As thinly disguised South
                        African and Portuguese military aid to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> becomes more apparent, it is possible more and more
                        African countries would side with rebels. Thus, unless <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> gets on political track promptly, we are
                        likely be confronted with following highly undesirable prospects:
                        escalation; increasing isolation of US and Belgians in de facto alliance
                        with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, South Africans,
                        Portuguese and Rhodesians; and difficult choice between increasing aid and
                        disengaging, both of which would involve risks we wish avoid. In light these
                        considerations and fact that even if we took on increased military and
                        political burden we would still have no assurance solution <pb n="574" facs="0607" xml:id="pg_574"/>to Congo problem would result, we strongly
                        favor seeking political solution and desire maximize chances of achieving
                        one.</p>
                    <p>Crucial period will be between arrival of <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> subcommittee in Leopoldville, anticipated Feb. 7, and Feb.
                        26 meeting of <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> FonMins. During this
                        period <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Commission will be developing
                        national conciliation plan for Congo. Sooner we and Belgians can decide on
                        elements we could accept in such plan, more likely we are to be able
                        influence <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> in right direction.</p>
                    <p>It is evident that to obtain political solution some political concessions
                        would have to be made to radical countries supporting rebels. Believe,
                        however, plan could be worked out which would keep both military and
                        political risks for <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> within acceptable
                        bounds. Moreover, chances for gaining acceptance for such plan would be
                        greatly increased if <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> could take
                        forthcoming attitude toward <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> efforts and
                        give moderates something to work with. Even if effort failed, <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> would have enhanced its position with
                        moderates and shifted onus for intransigence to rebels and their
                        supporters.</p>
                    <p>Any plan will presumably be based on four principal elements of <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss>
                        resolution: (1) nonintervention, (2) cease-fire, (3) withdrawal of
                        mercenaries, and (4) national reconciliation. Maximum objective of rebels
                        and their supporters would be plan which would (1) call for discontinuance
                        of all military assistance to <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> without
                        interfering with covert military assistance to rebels; (2) place
                        responsibility for initiating cease-fire on <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>; (3) insist on immediate, unconditional withdrawal of
                        mercenaries; and (4) propose government of national reconciliation excluding
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> as Prime Minister and
                        including rebel leaders which would set date and determine conditions for
                        national elections. On other hand, maximum objective of <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> and its supporters would be plan which
                        would: (1) bar aid to rebels but permit continued assistance to <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>; (2) place responsibility for cease-fire
                        on rebels; (3) allow <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> to maintain
                        effectiveness of its armed forces, including mercenaries as long as
                        militarily necessary; and (4) retain <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> as <gloss target="#t_PM_1">PM</gloss> but exclude
                        rebel leaders from pre-election government and proceed with elections only
                        where <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> fully in control.</p>
                    <p>Both we and Belgians have consistently advocated political solution which
                        recognizes <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> sovereignty and
                        territorial integrity of Congo. Political solution means negotiations
                        between <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> and therefore inevitably compromise between positions set
                        out above.</p>
                    <p>Following are some ideas which we believe acceptable from point of view of
                            <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> basic interests as well as
                        Belgo-US interests. They should be viewed as package since neither <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> nor rebels could be expected to accept

                        and rebels would declare publicly their willingness to abide by cease-fire
                        as soon as all parts of <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> plan for
                        implementing it were agreed to by all parties concerned and observers were
                        in place. (Cease-fire would, of course, not prevent either party from
                        dealing with disturbances of public order in territories under their
                        control. Nor would it prevent <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>,
                        perhaps in consultation with <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>, from
                        securing help to develop long-run capability for maintaining internal
                        security on its own.)</p>
                    <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">Nonintervention</hi>: Plan for implementing cease-fire
                        would call on all <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> members on one hand
                        to cooperate with cease-fire by not supplying or permitting supply of arms
                        or ammunition to rebels, and on other hand call for suspension of all
                        further outside military assistance to <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>’s combat forces as long as cease-fire in effect. For their
                        parts, <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> and rebels would agree neither
                        to request nor receive military assistance for duration of cease-fire. Plan
                        would also provide for agreement of <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>,
                        rebel authorities, and neighboring countries to permit stationing in areas
                        under their control of observers from <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>,
                        and possibly <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, to check on implementation
                        of these agreements. Suspension of all outside military assistance would be
                        effective as soon as observers in place and cease-fire in effect. To assure
                        that individual observers were acceptable to <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> and other party concerned, lists would be presented in
                        advance for their approval.</p>
                    <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">Mercenaries</hi>: <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> would agree to phase out mercenaries as rapidly as it
                        could obtain substitutes to help maintain internal security, which it would
                        agree to try to obtain from <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> countries
                        of its own choice. <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Commission would
                        urge countries receiving <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> requests for
                        troops or police to comply promptly to extent possible. (We would like
                        Belgian views on what countries would be acceptable to <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> and estimate of number of troops they
                        could provide.)</p>
                    <p>(4) <hi rend="italic">National Reconciliation</hi>: <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> would agree to proceed with national reconciliation by
                        holding national elections in March as announced in all areas where security
                        situation permits. It would reiterate its offer of amnesty to those who laid
                        down their arms and allow all citizens to participate in elections on same
                        basis, including rebels who are abiding by cease-fire. In rebel areas, ad
                        hoc arrangements for temporary administration during pre-election period
                        would be worked out on local basis with approval of central government. For
                        their part, rebels would agree to seek representation in government of
                        national reconciliation through electoral process. They would not insist on
                        “round-table” or formation, before elections, of government of national
                        reconciliation excluding <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and
                        including rebels. (However, part of the bargaining process may result in
                        some commitment by <pb n="576" facs="0609" xml:id="pg_576"/><gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> to include “rehabilitated” rebels in
                        post-election cabinet.) <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> would also
                        inform <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> of its intention to invite
                        certain <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> countries, as well as <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_SYG_1">SYG</gloss>, to send observers. All parties would
                        agree in principle to accept results of elections.</p>
                    <p>Presumably, there would need to be sweeteners on both sides. On <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> side, in light of apparently
                        satisfactory settlement of contentieux, one sweetener might be acceleration
                        and expansion of Belgian technical assistance to Congo. This might place
                        particular emphasis on prompt introduction “equipes polyvalentes” to help
                        maintain order in all areas where circumstances permit their employment. On
                            <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> side, sweetener might include US
                        offers of logistical support for <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>
                        observer teams, airlift to bring African troops to Congo and some financial
                        support for African troops and/or police while in Congo. (We are not in
                        position to make any commitments on these points but would explore ways and
                        means once general agreement on plan reached.) On rebel side, effort to sell
                        this package may take form of some enticement to disenchanted rebels to
                        break away from <persName corresp="#p_GCH_1">Gbenye</persName> leadership.
                        It would also include assurances to <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>
                        that US would take steps to assure that cease-fire was not broken through
                        use of US-supplied aircraft for combat operations.</p>
                    <p>Clearly it would be unwise to put forward at this or any other time a
                        “Belgo-US plan”. It seems to us essential that there be considerable African
                        palaver on this subject as means of educating both sides to realities.
                        Meanwhile it is equally essential that we and Belgians in first instance and
                        perhaps British at a later date determine in our own mind limits to which we
                        feel we can go and still get a livable political solution. We should also
                        consider means of persuading, when the time comes, both the <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> to agree on a reasonable solution as well as to take into
                        account the alternatives. Approach to <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>
                        would be through selected moderates. We would also have to consider what
                        steps we might urge moderates to take outside <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> if <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> effort should break
                            down.<note n="2" xml:id="d395fn2">In telegram 2899 from Leopoldville,

                    <p>About ten days ago you called my attention to a bad story in the <hi rend="italic">Herald Tribune</hi> about the White House and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d396fn2">On
                            February 2, the <hi rend="italic">Herald Tribune</hi> printed a critical
                            story about U.S. Congo policy alleging that the Department of State was
                            opposed to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, although the
                            White House supported him. That same day, <persName corresp="#p_KRW_1">Komer</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BMG_1">Bundy</persName>
                            sent a memorandum to the President stating that these allegations, which
                            reiterated previous complaints by Dodd, could be traced to the Senator’s
                            assistant, David Martin. They also reported that Dodd had agreed to urge
                                <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to be more
                            conciliatory toward his African colleagues when the Senator met with him
                            in London at Churchill’s funeral. (Ibid., Memos to the President,
                                <persName corresp="#p_BMG_1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>, Vol.
                            8)</note> We traced this sharply and clearly to Senator Dodd, and still
                        more to his assistant, David Martin. (Martin admits that both Dodd and he
                        spoke to Freidin in London.)</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, I think you will want to know that in fact Dodd’s meeting with
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> worked out very much to
                        our advantage. We have our own transcript from Dodd, and the Senator said
                        all the things we asked him to say about how <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> should widen his circle of friends, play ball with
                        the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>, broaden his Cabinet, and be
                        responsive to the Belgians. Dodd even told <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> that the State Department—and of course the White
                        House—were his friends.</p>
                    <p>At least partly as a result, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        has paid some real attention to these matters in recent days, and the mess
                        in the Congo looks less discouraging than at any time during recent months.
                        (Cross your fingers.)</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, Bob <persName corresp="#p_KRW_1">Komer</persName> has had a
                        good time beating up Dodd’s assistant, who has made all sorts of apologetic
                        noises. As a result I think we got some considerable net help from Dodd, and
                        at the same time have left his people feeling that they owe us
                        something.</p>

                    <p>1. The meeting was primarily devoted to a presentation by the three
                        ambassadors to East Africa of their views on the current situation in each
                        of the three countries. They were respectively William <persName corresp="#p_AWH_1">Attwood</persName>, ambassador to Kenya; William
                        Leonhart, ambassador to Tanzania; and Olcott <persName corresp="#p_DOH_1">Deming</persName>, ambassador to Uganda.</p>
                    <p>2. In the latter part of the meeting, Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> opened debate on what measures might be taken by
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to make his regime more
                        acceptable to the East Africans and conversely what steps might be taken to
                        persuade the East African states to cease their assistance to the Congolese
                        rebels. In the course of this discussion, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AWH_1">Attwood</persName> commented that if <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> could not be persuaded to take the
                        steps that would make him acceptable, we might consider withdrawing our aid
                        to him since the resulting chaos might be preferable to our ever deepening
                        involvement in an unpopular cause. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> asked in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRI_1">Helms</persName>’s absence if we had any comment on this point. I said
                        that if chaos alone was all we had to fear, then a strong case could be made
                        for our disengagement. I went on to say, however, that we had firm evidence
                        that the Chinese Communists saw in the Congo rebellion a great opportunity
                        and were determined if possible to gain a position of commanding influence
                        by support to the rebels. They did not underestimate both the Congo’s
                        mineral wealth and its strategic position. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> supported my view and restated it
                        even more strongly, warning that nobody should have any illusions as to what
                        a rebel victory might mean. He said at best we could expect something like
                        the <persName corresp="#p_BBA_1">Ben Bella</persName> regime in Algeria, and
                        perhaps something a good deal worse.</p>
                    <p>3. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> concluded the
                        meeting by requesting that each of the three ambassadors draw up a list of
                        the minimum concessions <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        would have to make to gain acceptance in East Africa.<note n="2" xml:id="d397fn2">The minutes of the Special Group (<gloss target="#t_CI_1">CI</gloss>) meeting on February 11 state that the

                        relations with all neighbors including Uganda. As entire world knows <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> engaged in putting down armed rebellion
                        and unfortunately that rebellion being supplied and directed via safe-havens
                        in neighboring countries. Congolese army and air force have strict
                        instructions respect international boundaries regardless provocations. This
                        not always easy in heat of battle near a border. Question of sanctity of
                        borders has greatly concerned <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> for
                        some time. It appears that Uganda is now equally concerned therefore it
                        would seem appropriate time to reach mutual agreement to assure no further
                        border violations from either side. <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>
                        willing discuss with <gloss target="#t_GOU_1">GOU</gloss> at any time and
                        place how to remove this irritant to their relations. Specifically <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> would propose stationing of small
                        observer force along common border, force to be supplied by mutually agreed
                        upon <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> member or members. This solution
                        would have additional advantage, once aid to rebellion had been stopped and
                        other African security forces are made available, of permitting the <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> to begin fulfilling its desire to send
                        South African mercenaries home in accordance with Addis and <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> resolutions. Or, if <gloss target="#t_GOU_1">GOU</gloss> has other suggestions, <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> would like to hear and consider them. Interests of peace
                        and African solidarity require that two countries come to agreement.</p>

                    <p>When <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> came in yesterday to
                        report on his trip to Leoville, I was suitably complimentary. We then
                        discussed the gains <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> had made
                        since our last meeting. I underscored how important it is now, with the
                        African moderates gaining strength, for <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to be as responsive as possible to the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>. If the radicals try to back off,
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> must move closer. We
                        want either to tie the radicals to a reasonable peacemaking proposition or
                        pin on them the blame for failure. <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> seemed to get the point and I agreed with him that
                        this tactic would have its problems since the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> is unpredictable (to wit, the failure of Guinea and Ghana
                        to show up for the ad hoc commission exercise in Leoville).</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> agreed that we had made
                        gains recently. He cited especially the Belgian financial settlement. (In an
                        aside, he said that he had found <persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> highly impressed with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s performance during the Brussels talks). <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s meeting with the African
                        Ambassadors in Leoville had also been quite successful. (He said he had
                        “watched” this performance from behind a curtain.) He didn’t think we had
                        gained too much from Farmer’s visit, but thought that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> had impressed Farmer and that
                        Farmer would hesitate now to speak out against <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> personally. <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> was also pleased with the results of the
                        conference at Nouakchott.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s next big domestic problem,
                            <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> said, is his election
                        campaign next month. <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName>
                        pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> is under
                        constant pressures to support local politicians. However, he seems to be
                        bearing up and <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> expects him
                        to do very well in the election. The current plan is to hold elections in
                        the safe areas first and then to move out later on.</p>
                    <p>I urged that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> invite observers
                        to come in for the election. <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> said he didn’t know how many would accept such an
                        invitation and thought there was some problem in having formal observers
                        from the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>. I said I thought it really
                        didn’t matter who came. The important thing was to be able to say after the
                        election that everyone had been invited. <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> nodded assent.</p>
                    <p>He said that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> is extremely
                        grateful for US aid. However, one additional point had occurred to him:
                        Would it be possible for us to <pb n="582" facs="0615" xml:id="pg_582"/>send
                        one or two patrol boats to hamper the flow of arms across Lake Tanganyika? I
                        said this sounded like a sensible idea and asked Hal <persName corresp="#p_SHA_1">Saunders</persName> to look into it.</p>
                    <p>He said confidentially he wanted me to know that Congolese Chargé Cardoso has
                        apparently been involved in some sort of embezzlement here. <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> said he didn’t want to get
                        involved in this and didn’t know what <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> intended to do about it. However, he thought if we
                        knew in advance there would be less chance of misreading if <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> called Cardoso home. I told him to
                        take this up with State; <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fredericks</persName>
                        wanted to talk with him. <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName>
                        also mentioned present plans to settle in Washington after the Congolese
                        election if all goes well for <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>.</p>
                    <p>I worried several specifics: First, I wished the <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> could keep its planes away from the Ugandan border. He
                        asked exactly what had happened and I replied that we aren’t sure yet.
                        However, the point was that the <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> had
                        so much more to lose diplomatically than it could gain militarily by taking
                        chances on its planes bombing the wrong side of the border. So I thought it
                        imperative that the <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> give the border a
                        wide berth.<note n="2" xml:id="d399fn2">Circular telegram 1539, February 20,
                            reported that the Congolese Government responded to the Ugandan protest

                            to an ill-defined frontier and proposing a mixed Congolese-Ugandan
                            commission to make an on-the-spot study and establish responsibility.
                            The telegram also reported that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> in a February 19 Leopoldville press conference

                            Ugandan territory and charged that the incident was a Ugandan
                            fabrication to cover up for rebel incursions into the Congo from Uganda.

                    <p>Second, I said we had heard rumors that the Congolese forces might be getting
                        ready to use napalm. I had no idea whether these rumors were true, but I
                        wanted to take no chances and mentioned this because <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> would get a terrible black eye if
                        his planes, piloted by whites, were to be accused of dropping napalm on
                        “innocent Africans.” <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> took
                        all this in, and I got the impression that he would weigh in against it.</p>
                    <p>Third, we agreed that the mercenary problem was still very much with us.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> was quite willing to get rid of
                        the South Africans and accept other Africans in their place as soon as he
                        could find them. He deplored Major Hoare’s public statements about mercenary
                        recruiting. I urged that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        tell Hoare to stick to fighting and leave public statements to the
                        government.</p>
                    <p>In parting <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> said he would be
                        in town for the next couple of weeks and would welcome hearing from us any
                        time we had thoughts on these problems.</p>

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> came in urgently at 2:00
                        p.m., having just talked to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        on the phone. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> had just
                        returned to Leopoldville from the political conference at Luluabourg full of
                        what he considered his great success there in wrapping up extensive
                        political support for the coming election.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> called <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> “as soon as he returned” to ask
                        whether we’d answered his request through <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> for money to bolster his election campaign.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> then launched into a
                        real pitch to the effect that now is the crucial time for <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>; a big election victory would give
                        us a unified Congo by spring and win respect for <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> in other African capitals. He
                        urged that help in the “next 20 days:” would really pay off for us.</p>
                    <p>I reassured him that <persName corresp="#p_KRW_1">Komer</persName> had put
                        his request into the right hands and simply promised to find out where we
                        stand. I said I would give him an idea before day’s end (he’ll be calling
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> again tonight) when he
                        might expect an answer one way or the other. I did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> say anything about what the answer might be, though he said
                        he’d like to give <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> some
                        notion of whether it would be favorable.</p>
                    <p>The second point <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> had
                        raised—definitely secondary to the first in <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName>’ pitch—was the need to replace the two T–28’s
                        downed last week. I said we were still searching for them and were keenly
                        aware of the need for aircraft but would have to wait until we concluded our
                        search before we thought any further about replacements.</p>
                    <p>Third, <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> mentioned again that
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s “comptroller” had
                        verified Chargé Cardoso’s “embezzlement” of funds here. He said <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> would probably recall Cardoso. He
                        said, as he had last week, that he wanted us to know this simply so we
                        wouldn’t misinterpret Cardoso’s recall.</p>
                    <p>At one point, in an aside, <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName>
                        intimated that I probably had seen the tape of their conversation. I shook
                        my head negatively, but he was already off to his next point.</p>
                    <p>He left with another quick plug for help and my agreement to call him.</p>
                    <pb n="585" facs="0618" xml:id="pg_585"/>
                    <p>After talking with Twining/<persName corresp="#p_FGD_1">Fields</persName> and
                        McIlvaine, at 5:10 p.m. I phoned <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> this message: “I have thoroughly checked progress
                        on your request. I’m satisfied that the people working on it fully
                        understand its urgency. However, they are not quite ready to make a
                        decision. I don’t have any indication what the decision will be, but I do
                        expect we will have an answer one way or the other by the first of next
                        week.” He said he’d tell <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>,
                        and I reiterated that we don’t know yet what the answer will be. He thanked
                        me for checking.</p>
                    <p>McIlvaine and Twining had arranged to send the gist of <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName>’ pitch to Leoville for <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>’s recommendation. All agree that,
                        if we do anything, we’ll do it in Leoville, not through <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName>. However, we thought that
                        mentioning Leoville now would only put Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> on the spot if we decided
                        negatively.</p>

                        violated Ugandan airspace and attacked Nyapea on Feb 22 and may have

                    <p>Before he left, Bob <persName corresp="#p_KRW_1">Komer</persName> asked me to
                        bring you up to date on the <hi rend="italic">deteriorating situation in the
                            Congo.</hi>
                        <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> has gained some ground since
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> sessions in December, but we’ve made
                        no progress toward a cease-fire.</p>
                    <p>Now the <hi rend="italic">rebel counter-offensive</hi> we’ve feared may have
                        begun. Last week Congolese rebels bolstered by Ugandan regulars crossed into
                        the northeastern Congo and took several towns. Shipments from Algeria and
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss> have swelled rebel arms caches, and
                        rebel fighters are training with Arab mentors in East African safe
                        havens.</p>
                    <p>The Ugandan Prime Minister, panicked by two alleged air strikes on Ugandan
                        border towns, has asked for planes from Communist China and Algeria. We’ve
                        rejected hysterical charges that we’re responsible and are plugging for
                        negotiations which would seal off the border.</p>
                    <pb n="587" facs="0620" xml:id="pg_587"/>
                    <p>So far, the Congolese army and mercenaries have contained the incursions, and
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> with our encouragement
                        has offered to negotiate. To keep on a political track, we’re trying to
                        build on his offer by floating the idea that pacifying the border with
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> or African observers could be a first
                        step toward the cease-fire which we badly need. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s forces would be no match for a well-run rebel push
                        supported from outside, and we don’t want to face that kind of
                        escalation.</p>
                    <p>We may see another round of radical propaganda from the <hi rend="italic">African foreign ministers’ meeting which meets this weekend.</hi>
                        However, the moderates there are stronger than at any time since the
                        rebellion began last summer. We’ve done a substantial amount of diplomatic
                        spadework and hope they’ll produce some reasonable proposals for controlling
                        hostilities.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">You might want to ask Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> about this</hi>. With <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> no longer overseeing our Congo

                            by <persName corresp="#p_SHA_1">Saunders</persName> stating that
                                <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> had phoned him at
                            9:15 a.m. to ask whether a decision had been made regarding <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s request for financial help
                            in his election campaign. <persName corresp="#p_SHA_1">Saunders</persName> had responded that the matter would be handled
                            in Leopoldville and that they were sympathetic, although a decision had
                            not yet been made. At 10:30 a.m., <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> called back to report that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> was leaving for Nairobi that
                            night and would wait for an answer there.</note> Just before you and RWK
                        left, <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName>—then just back from
                        Leoville—made a pitch “at <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s
                        request” for financial support to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s election campaign chest.</p>
                    <p>RWK asked <persName corresp="#p_FGD_1">Glenn Fields</persName> in <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> for an informal opinion. <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> is willing (though certainly not to the
                        extent of the $3.3 million <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName>
                        <pb n="589" facs="0622" xml:id="pg_589"/>mentioned) but defers to State
                        guidance. State hasn’t made up its mind yet, but is wary of getting
                        involved.</p>
                    <p>The big problem is that <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>’s
                        characteristic suspicions of potential rivals are cropping out again. He
                        fears <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> will use the election
                        to unseat him. If we do anything for <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, we’ll want to be sure he’s in good odor with
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>, so we don’t end up
                        backing an ex-Prime Minister. However, if they’re together a little help
                        might be useful in improving our leverage or achieving limited
                        objectives.</p>
                    <p>The most dangerous immediate consequence of this rift is that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> is afraid to go to the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Foreign Ministers’ meeting now sitting in
                        Nairobi for fear <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> will fire
                        him while he’s away. We’ve pulled all the stops to get him there because the
                        African atmosphere is better than at any time in the past six months, and it
                        would be a great loss not to take advantage of it.</p>
                    <p>If State decides this is a good idea, <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                        could probably work on a small scale within its present authority. My
                        feeling is that we wouldn’t want to get involved buying votes for <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> on any grand scale (<persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fredericks</persName> believes he has enough money
                        for this). However, it might be worthwhile giving limited help <hi rend="italic">IF</hi>

                    <p>In telegram 90199 to the Station in Leopoldville, March 5, 1965, the Central
                        Intelligence Agency reported on a consensus reached regarding the political
                        divisions within the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo
                            (<gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>). There was no doubt such
                        schisms existed, the telegram stated. President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> suspected Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> complained to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> concerning <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Joseph Mobutu</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Victor Nendaka</persName> was disturbed over the
                        proliferation of intelligence agencies in the <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>. Regardless of the degree to which the split had gone or
                        was going, it seemed clear that the [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not
                            declassified</hi>] were at least taking out reinsurance by siding with
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> against <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. All this activity was bound to
                        have a disruptive effect on an already chaotic <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>, the telegram stated, and the U.S. Government must attempt
                        to minimize it. Thus it should undertake selective, modest, ad hoc funding
                        of specific individuals, not parties, for specific purposes, to keep all
                        lines open and to provide some leverage in counseling moderation [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]. (Central Intelligence Agency

                    <p>On the other side of the coin, the telegram continued, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> was suspicious of the [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] or any other power block
                        that he could not completely control. His request for election <pb n="591" facs="0624" xml:id="pg_591"/>funds was probably made not because he
                        needed money but rather to test U.S. willingness to stand behind him
                        personally. If the U.S. response was negative or too little he could be
                        expected to interpret the lack of support as a manifestation of an active
                            anti-<persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> position. <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> believed, albeit reluctantly, that the
                        U.S. could not risk such an interpretation. In its initial approach, the
                        U.S. could assure <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> it would
                        make every effort to obtain the [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not
                            declassified</hi>] support for the <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> in the
                        critical pre-election period. The “net message” to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> should be that the greatest danger
                        to the Congo was the creation of feuding factions would lead to an
                        internecine struggle similar to that in Vietnam. (Ibid.)</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>1. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have noted a recent telegram from the Secretary
                        of State to Embassy Leopoldville, State 2023, dated 15 February 1965,<note n="2" xml:id="d408fn2">Not printed. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 23–9 THE CONGO)</note>
                        which expressed grave concern regarding the use of napalm in the Congo. They
                        have noted in particular that the American Ambassador to Leopoldville has
                        been directed to inform Premier <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> that it is not in the best interests of the
                        Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (<gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>) to employ napalm and that its use would
                        require the withdrawal of US operational planes.</p>
                    <p>2. CINCSTRIKE/USCINCMEAFSA has informed the Joint Chiefs of Staff that he
                        views with concern the apprehensions held in certain <pb n="592" facs="0625" xml:id="pg_592"/>circles concerning the possible use of napalm in the
                        Congo. He has pointed out that these apprehensions appear to stem from undue
                        sensitivity over the effect of this weapon, and that, if these apprehensions
                        and opposition to usage continue, we risk, through self-imposed limitations,
                        the denial to tactical air forces of one of their most effective
                        weapons.</p>
                    <p>3. The Joint Chiefs of Staff agree with the views of CINCSTRIKE/USCINCMEAFSA
                        and consider that restrictions on the use of conventional air support
                        weapons are militarily unwise and the use of napalm should be based upon
                        military considerations. They believe that sovereign governments should be
                        permitted to utilize the best conventional weapons available to them in
                        their defense. In this regard, napalm is considered to be conventional
                        ordnance which produces highly effective results with greater efficiency in
                        effort against appropriate military targets. The use of napalm could provide
                        the <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> with an element of superiority
                        which would unquestionably be most useful in combatting the present
                        externally supported rebel insurgency in the Congo.</p>
                    <p>4. Accordingly, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that:</p>
                    <p>a. The present policy restricting the use of napalm by the <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> be rescinded.<note n="3" xml:id="d408fn3">A memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_WEG_1">Wheeler</persName>
                            attached to the original states that JCSM–185–65 was discussed
                            informally with <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName>, who
                            indicated that the Department of State would not concur at that time in
                            the introduction of napalm in the Congo because the psychological
                            reaction of the African states would favor the rebels and the radical
                            states would harden their support of the rebels. The Department’s
                            position did not rule out future reconsideration of the use of napalm,
                            if there was a specific and highly important military need.</note></p>

                    <p>McGB:</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Possible item for Thursday</hi>. Before I left, I had a
                        direct pitch from <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> via
                            <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> for money to help his
                        election campaign. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> then put
                        it to <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>. Our best guess is that
                        he’s looking for a sign of personal support. Though he can use the money,
                        it’s probably not vital.</p>
                    <p>The biggest risk is further charges of making <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> a US puppet if Africans find out. [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines not declassified</hi>] We’d also have to be careful not to
                        give suspicious <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> the idea
                        we’re backing <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to unseat him.
                        In fact, <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> opposed <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>’s original proposal for aid to both
                        separately because he didn’t want to involve us in that squabble.</p>
                    <p>However, <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> argues the risks
                        would be worth taking and the money well spent if we could cement the
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> relationship and stave off the
                        mess we’d have if they fell out in the heat of election maneuvering. So he
                        would agree to a [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>]
                        total for both (plus a [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                            declassified</hi>] contingency fund) if he can get firm assurances that
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> will each support the other’s
                        continued tenure.</p>
                    <p>Soapy is nervous about being involved, but <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fredericks</persName> [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] would go ahead on <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>’s conditions. <hi rend="italic">They fear that
                                <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> will, in Bantu
                            fashion, read a negative answer as a sign that we’re turning away from
                            him</hi>. They’ll take it up with <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> and, if he approves, bring it to your group.</p>
                    <p>I share Soapy’s wariness, but think we can have the best of both worlds if we
                        play our cards right. If we stick closely to <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>’s conditions (which serve both men) and they don’t
                        come through, we still get some credit for the offer. If they agree, we’re a
                        step closer (even allowing for holes in their promises) to keeping as
                        effective drivers as we’ll find at the wheel.</p>

                    <p>McGB:</p>
                    <p>We’ve gained some ground in <hi rend="italic">the Congo</hi> since year’s
                        end. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> has won wider support
                        among the non-interventionist Africans, and together they stood off the
                        interventionists at the recent <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> foreign
                        ministers’ meeting. We now think the only reason they didn’t vote a moderate
                        Congo resolution was that they preferred no resolution to a showdown that

                    <p>At home, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s elections will run
                        through April, and half a dozen African governments have already named
                        observers. There will be a lot of political pulling and hauling between
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>, but we hope each realizes his
                        need for the other. In the northeast, Col. Hoare’s offensive to cut rebel
                        supply routes from Uganda and the Sudan is moving ahead steadily. Cutting
                        the line from Tanzania is tougher. Rumors of a rebel counteroffensive
                        continue to fly; we know almost 60 planeloads of arms are stockpiled for
                        them in the area; we’ve seen two new airfields in rebel territory. So far
                        the rebels haven’t marshalled serious opposition, but even if this push
                        succeeds, there’s still a lot of mopping up to do.</p>
                    <p>We’re concentrating now on putting together an African political umbrella for
                        the Congo. This is the only sure way to turn off aid to the rebels.
                        Moreover, Hoare’s forces are too thin to hold against another big rebel
                        push, so we’d want to fall back immediately on political defenses. Although
                        we’ve gained substantial African support since December’s <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolution passed, we haven’t gone past
                        first base in setting up machinery to close the Congo’s borders. We’ve given
                        State a skeleton action program for doing this and have asked them to come
                        up with a refined version by the end of the week.</p>
                    <p>Our longer range purpose is to disengage somewhat so as to restore balance to
                        our African policy. The Congo tail has wagged too much of the African dog
                        over the last six months. African machinery would help fill some of the
                        vacuum, and <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> and RWK should
                        come back with a clearer view of how much cooperation we can count on from

                        ahead: (1) We’re already doing so much in the Congo that’s obvious (planes,
                        military mission) that a few rumors about political meddling won’t add
                        noticeably to the din; (2) <hi rend="italic">This is the only handle we have
                            for getting <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> not to angle

                        from McIlvaine. Finally took campaign contribution matter up with Secretary
                        who pointed out that it had been very useful for him in his meetings with
                        African Foreign Ministers to be able to say we had no responsibility for
                        individuals in Congo but had nonetheless supported the successive legitimate
                        govts. No matter who involved and that he did not wish to compromise the

                        with which blackmail us. Secretary decided therefore that you should go to
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and tell him frankly
                        that there no question our support as evidenced by our aid and diplomatic
                        activity but that it neither in our interest or his for <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> to get involved in this kind of internal
                        political activity.</p>
                    <p>Having made this point clear to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> Sec. sees no objection to indicating to him that if
                        he really does need campaign money you know that he has many private friends
                        in the states some of whom might be disposed to help him out and that you
                        would be glad to see that this word is passed to them if he, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, could provide a bank act. no.

                        gotten much press play, things are looking up in the Congo. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s mercenary columns finally took
                        all of the key towns along the northeast border through which the rebels
                        were getting outside supplies. This should have a considerable damping
                        effect, even though there are still several pockets of rebel strength.
                        Moreover, the Northeast Congo was retaken by less than 200 mercenaries, and
                        200 well-trained “enemy” mercenaries could conceivably take it all back
                        again. Meanwhile <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s elections
                        are proceeding well, despite a snafu in Leopoldville because the ballots for

                        states are coming out more and more in <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s favor. It’s not too much to hope that the active
                        phase of the Congo rebellion may be down to manageable proportions in a few
                        months. We continue to work hard behind the scenes rallying support for our
                        Congo friends, and embarrassing those states still backing the rebels.</p>

                        as Embassy points out, raise spectre of renewed Katanga secession.</p>
                    <p>Of utmost importance in dealing with this threat that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss>
                        take same line. Initial step, therefore, should be for you to coordinate
                        approach with De <persName corresp="#p_KCD_1">Kerchove</persName> and

                        Binza group could be told that any split in moderate forces could turn clock
                        back to the chaos of the post-independence years and complicate efforts of

                        be emphasize that present <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> has met
                        with success and deserves loyal support of all moderates during critical
                        transition period, particularly now that elections under way.</p>
                    <p>In addition to approach to Binza group and <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>, if latter grants appointment, you may wish raise
                        subject again with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. You
                        could re-emphasize to him our support of <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> and our hope that his cooperation with <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> would continue. At same time we

                            <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>) represents significant
                        power faction which it dangerous ignore indefinitely. Now that his personal
                        popularity has reached new peak through success in northeast and through
                        favorable initial start in elections, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> may wish again consider possibility broadening his
                        government, if only by filling ministerial vacancies as they occur
                            (<persName corresp="#p_MGO_1">Munongo</persName>?). A broader government
                        could give added boost to his campaign win African support. Would be
                        particularly valuable if inclusion of member of Binza group could be used as

                        Leopoldville.</p>
                    <p>Dept leaves possible approach to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> along these lines to your discretion. It should not
                        be made if you believe it would further complicate situation by raising
                        suspicion in <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s mind that

                    </list>
                    <p>1. During the past two months there has been a considerable reduction of
                        rebel effectiveness in the Congo, particularly the northeast Congo. The
                        Ugandan and Sudanese borders have been cleared of rebel pockets and all
                        major roads leading from Uganda and the Sudan into the northeast Congo have
                        been seized by Congolese Government forces. Even if the Ugandan and Sudanese
                        Governments decide to resume shipments of arms and supplies to the rebels,
                        such shipments will of necessity have to go via circuitous routes and will,
                        in most instances, have to pass through areas now under Congolese Government
                        control. The potential of the rebel forces to foment disorder still remains
                        high but it now appears that these rebel groups are no longer under the
                        effective control of their leaders and their ability to regroup and
                        seriously threaten the security of the northeast is definitely declining.
                        The area of current rebel activity most likely to post a problem for the
                        Congolese government in the next 30–90 days in the western shore of Lake
                        Tanganyika, from Albertville in the south to Uvira in the north.</p>
                    <p>2. A major contributing factor to the reduction of effective rebel activity
                        in the northeast Congo in recent months has been the employment of aircraft
                        in support of the Congolese Army units, and the mercenaries of the 5th
                        Commando. The aircraft now being used, the B–26’s and the T–28’s, are being
                        utilized and maintained through mechanisms under the control of [<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>]. The tactical deployment of these
                        aircraft in support of ground units is, however, under the operational
                        control of the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>3. As of 27 April 1965, U.S. Government owned aircraft employed in tactical
                        support of ground operations in the northeast Congo and along the western
                        shore of Lake Tanganyika were as follows:</p>
                    <p>B–26—Five are in the Congo, all of which are based in Stanleyville. These
                        aircraft are manned by [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] crews.</p>
                    <pb n="601" facs="0634" xml:id="pg_601"/>
                    <p>T–28—Ten of these aircraft are now in the Congo and two more are enroute.
                        These aircraft are based in Bunia, Paulis, and Stanleyville. Except for four
                        Belgian pilots, all of these aircraft are manned [<hi rend="italic">less
                            than 1 line not declassified</hi>].</p>
                    <p>Helicopters—Two enroute to be manned [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>].</p>
                    <p>4. As [Department of State] is aware, the maintenance of these aircraft is
                        carried out by an organization which [<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>]
                        was instrumental in setting up. In addition to the maintenance mechanism,
                            [<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>] has facilitated the assignment of
                        air operations officers to Bunia, Paulis, Stanleyville, and Leopoldville to
                        insure that U.S. aircraft employed in the counter-insurgency program in the
                        Congo are used efficiently, effectively, and within policy limitations
                        established by our government. All of these air operations officers are U.S.
                        citizens.</p>
                    <p>5. Should the U.S. withdraw the above aircraft, the [<hi rend="italic">less
                            than 1 line not declassified</hi>] crews, and the maintenance facility,
                        the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> would have no effective tactical
                        air capability. However, since it is U.S. Government policy to reduce at the
                        earliest practical date U.S. involvement in the air operations aspect of the
                        counter-insurgency program, particularly the use of the B–26 aircraft and
                        the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] crews,
                            [<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>] requests that [Department of
                        State] inform [<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>] what course of action
                            [<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>] should follow in the next six
                        months to effect the withdrawal.</p>
                    <p>6. [<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>] submits for consideration by
                        [Department of State] the following as a general approach to the problem of
                        reducing U.S. presence in the Congo while at the same time maintaining a
                        tactical air capability in the Congo for the next year to 18 months.</p>
                    <p>A. At the earliest practical date, consistent with the improvement in the
                        general military situation in the Congo, remove the B–26 aircraft and those
                            [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] crews that
                        fly them. We believe, however, that so long as B–26 aircraft are in the
                        Congo [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] crews will
                        be required to fly them. Past experience has indicated that only a small
                        number of third country nationals are available to fly this particular type
                        of aircraft.</p>
                    <p>B. Retain in the Congo twelve T–28 aircraft, or an acceptable substitute, for
                        the foreseeable future. This will be in addition to the six T–6 aircraft now
                        in the 21st Squadron and the four T–6 now enroute from Italy.</p>
                    <p>C. Recommend to the Belgian Government and to Col. Bouzin, the Belgian air
                        adviser to the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>, that Belgian pilots be
                        recruited to take the place of the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] pilots, and that Belgian air operations officers be
                        recruited to replace U.S. air operations officers. Col. Bouzin has
                        informally stated that Belgian pilots can be recruited for the above
                        purpose. We believe that he should be encouraged to make the attempt.</p>
                    <pb n="602" facs="0635" xml:id="pg_602"/>
                    <p>D. As Belgian pilots become available from the recruiting effort of Col.
                        Bouzin or the Belgian Government they should be assigned to the 21st
                        Squadron or a new squadron. We feel it unwise to integrate the Belgian
                        pilots into the current U.S. sponsored program.</p>
                    <p>E. As the Belgian pilots are recruited, increments of three T–28 aircraft to
                        be transferred from the U.S. sponsored unit to the new squadron or the 21st
                        Squadron. With each transfer of T–28 aircraft there will be an equivalent
                        reduction of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]
                        pilots in the U.S. sponsored program until a point is reached where all T–28
                        aircraft have been transferred and all [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                            not declassified</hi>] pilots have been returned to [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>].</p>
                    <p>F. We believe that the U.S. will have to provide funds to maintain the
                        current aircraft maintenance facility until such time as the Belgians or the
                        Congolese assume this responsibility. We feel that the Belgian Government
                        should pay the salaries and all expenses connected with the recruitment and
                        employment of the Belgian pilots.</p>

                        there will be a concomitant reduction of U.S. control over and influence on

                        re-establishment of stability and <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>’s sensitivity to interference. On other hand while

                        infighting—even among those sharing same aims—is having a bad effect on US
                        public and congressional opinion. Thus further serious upheavals could very

                    <p>1. [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] dined with [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>] and [<hi rend="italic">name not
                            declassified</hi>] night 19 July. Per previous arrangement with
                            [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>], [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] carried most of conversational ball and
                        followed plan outlined para five ref.</p>
                    <p>2. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] welcomed [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] back to Congo and immediately asked how
                        he liked the climate. As [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]
                        obviously referring to the political climate, [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] took following line:</p>
                    <pb n="607" facs="0640" xml:id="pg_607"/>
                    <p>A. <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> policy is to avoid split
                        between <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> on one hand and
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] on other. Such split which now
                        appears possible, could only redound to the advantage of the rebels.</p>
                    <p>B. Main problem seems to be one of personalities and mutual distrust between
                        the two groups.</p>
                    <p>C. [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] pointed out that while <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> may in all good faith have tried
                        to work with <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>], some of his
                        entourage had erred in their actions. [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>]
                        cited fact that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> aware of
                        efforts bribe senior army officers and promises that these officers would
                        gain promotion if <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> were
                        removed from control of the army; fact that creation of competing security
                        services, and specifically the general incident, had upset <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and the [<hi rend="italic">less
                            than 1 line not declassified</hi>] who feared that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> entourage wished to liquidate them
                        physically.</p>
                    <p>3. All above was said after many protestations on part both [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] and [<hi rend="italic">name not
                            declassified</hi>] that frank speech was desirable and useful. In this
                        vein [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] said (with prior permission [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] he had carefully
                        checked all members of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] and that he was convinced that an entente between the
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> was both feasible and desirable.
                            [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] cited statements by all members
                        of the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] to the
                        effect they wished work with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        and maintain him as prime minister, provided he does not seek the
                        presidency. [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] added that he fully
                        convinced that the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                        declassified</hi>] as such would be willing to cooperate and he recommended
                        that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> enter into negotiations
                        with General <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, the latter to
                        speak on behalf of the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>]. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> had
                        already stated that he found it easier to deal with <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> than with <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> in that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> never failed to be frank in his
                        dealings with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] it would be
                        possible to reach an agreement with the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                            not declassified</hi>], [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] was
                        careful to note that he not in contact with <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>.)</p>
                    <p>4. In making the above statements [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>]
                        stressed <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> policy favored such an
                        entente and underlined that he was in the Congo to help achieve this
                        objective, not to support the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>]. [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] referred to
                        stories that had circulated that he was in the Congo to support the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] and denied
                        them.</p>
                    <p>5. During the conversation [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>]
                        and [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] repeatedly stressed that <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> believes <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> must remain as prime minister. In
                        this context [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] referred to his most
                        recent conversations with Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> and repeated the latter’s hope that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> would remain in the govt. (The
                        governor had authorized this.)</p>
                    <pb n="608" facs="0641" xml:id="pg_608"/>
                    <p>6. [<hi rend="italic">7 lines not declassified</hi>] and [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] hit hard on the consequences which would
                        result were <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to resign. He
                        acknowledged seriousness of such a step but indicated that he was not far
                        from resigning. [<hi rend="italic">5½ lines not declassified</hi>] the fact
                        that he has just brought all of his family back to <gloss target="#t_Leo_1">Leo</gloss>, convinced both [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>] and [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] that
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> does not now intend to
                        resign.</p>
                    <p>7. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] stated he was delighted
                        with the more than frank conversation, said he hoped [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] would continue to advise him, and said he
                        would look forward to seeing [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] again.
                        While recognize this probably polite talk from an accomplished politician,
                            [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] will make every effort to renew
                        contacts with [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] as often as is
                        feasible and/or as often as [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>]
                        will permit.</p>

                    <p>“Since our meeting in Brussels July 23 I have continued to follow the
                        Congolese scene closely. Although I had hoped that the political maneuvering
                        between Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> would subside,
                        information received during the last few days leads me to believe that we
                        may be approaching yet another and more serious crisis between the two
                        men.</p>
                    <p>We have been informed from reliable sources, on the one hand, that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>, encouraged by his
                        tactical successes over Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        in recent months, is determined to force the resignation of the latter’s
                        government before the Congolese Parliament convenes. On the other hand, we
                        have been told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> has
                        concluded that it would be impossible for him to continue to work with Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and that he plans to
                        contest the presidency.</p>
                    <p>Both Belgium and the United States, convinced that continuing cooperation
                        between the two men is most important to the immediate future of the Congo,
                        have tried to impress upon Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, as well as other Congolese leaders, their concern
                        in this matter.</p>
                    <p>However, it seems doubtful that simple expressions of concern will suffice
                        given the volatile nature of Congolese politics and the aspirations for
                        power of the principals as well as others, including the Binza Group. If you
                        share these views, I suggest that Belgium and the United States explore
                        immediately what methods we might employ singly and jointly.</p>
                    <p>Given the nature of the Belgian and US commitments in the Congo, I think we
                        can best achieve our common aim through coordinated action, since there will
                        undoubtedly be a temptation on the part of those who oppose that aim to
                        divide us in favor of one group or the other.</p>
                    <p>We have asked our Embassy in Leopoldville for its comments on what steps the
                        United States could best take to prevent a split between <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>.

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Congo Troubles</hi>. We are busting a gut to prevent a
                        split between our two Congolese prima donnas—<persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> wants
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>’s job as President and
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> is talking of sacking

                    <p>Our policy is crystal clear. We’ve been providing all-out support to both in
                        an effort to finally close out the rebellion. Our line is that they must
                        stick together till the war is won, or they’ll hang separately. A <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> split just now might easily cause the whole
                        rebellion to flare up again.</p>
                    <p>But <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> is bidding desperately
                        for our favor. He got hold of Senator Dodd in Europe and gave him an earful

                                (1967) (Restricted).</note> that Bob <persName corresp="#p_KRW_1">Komer</persName> warned you about. Dodd’s meeting with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> in Brussels last week
                            triggered it.</hi></p>
                    <p>Dodd alleges that State is working against <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, whom he views as the key to Congolese stability.
                        Dodd has been a <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> man ever
                        since <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> led Katanga province
                        into secession and we opposed in order to keep the country together as a
                        viable unit. He says he thought State had accepted <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> after he returned as prime
                        minister last July and we helped him put down the rebellion. But now Dodd
                        sees signs that we’re ditching <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and backing President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> against him. Dodd hopes the <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> rivalry will quiet down, but if it doesn’t he feels
                        strongly we should back <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The problem is that Dodd gets most of his information from <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName>, his Washington lobbyist. Bob <persName corresp="#p_KRW_1">Komer</persName> and the State people clued him fully
                        last winter and thought they’d won him over (as he admits in his letter).
                        But every time <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> gets to him, he swallows their
                        line again.</p>
                    <p>I’m attaching a point-by-point comment on his facts,<note n="3" xml:id="d426fn3">Attached but not printed.</note> but the basic point is
                        that <hi rend="italic">we have backed <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> solidly and still are</hi>. It’s fair to say
                        that we’ve done more for him in the past year than for any other African
                        leader. We agree with Dodd that the Congo could easily become our number one
                        African headache, so we made a major military, covert, diplomatic and
                        economic effort to help <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> put
                        down the rebellion, cut off outside support, improve his African image and
                        begin rehabilitation. Now, the back of the rebellion is broken (though one
                        area is still to be liberated), and we’re getting down to business with the
                        new Belgian government on longer range military and administrative programs
                        to get the Congo on its feet.</p>
                    <p>Since the current <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> sparring began in earnest last
                        February, we’ve turned ourselves inside out to keep <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> from firing <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and to keep <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> from trying to take the presidency
                        from <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>. We agree with Dodd
                        that this sparring could <pb n="616" facs="0649" xml:id="pg_616"/>trigger a
                        major political crisis. We also agree that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> is indispensable to getting the Congo on its feet,
                        because he’s more of a doer than anyone else on the scene. However, <hi rend="italic">we believe he’s helpful only if he works with <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> since these two represent the
                            two main power bases in the Congo</hi>. Unless they stick together, the
                        Congo will split as it did when <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> went it alone in Katanga. <hi rend="italic">So we
                            don’t agree with Dodd that we can keep the Congo together by backing
                                <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> alone</hi>.</p>
                    <p>I ought to mention, since Dodd attacks him, that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> has been a prime innovator and
                        pusher of this policy. He has worked on the Congo since independence and
                        naturally backed US and <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> policy in
                        opposing the Katanga secession, so <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> may well harbor lingering suspicions. It’s entirely
                        possible too that <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> has his
                        reservations about <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> as an
                        individual. However, Governor <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName> talked this problem out with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> during his visit to the Congo last
                        August, and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> assured
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName> that he could work with
                            <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>. The record shows that
                            <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> has accepted <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> as indispensable and has worked
                        well with him. He has spent as much effort behind the scenes since February
                        to persuade <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and his
                        followers not to dump <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> as he
                        has trying to keep <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> in line.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> in Brussels last week
                        told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KRB_1">Knight</persName> that he
                        counts <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> as a “good friend” and
                        says he told Dodd the same.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KRW_1">Komer</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Wayne Fredericks</persName> at State had already
                        asked Dodd for an appointment (probably early next week) before this letter
                        arrived. So you could let them straighten Dodd out on his facts. We’ve had
                        virtually no other Congressional flak on the Congo.</p>

                    <p>1. The following is for your information. Discussions were held on the Congo
                        at the Department of State, 26–27 August 1965. State Department
                        representatives were <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Wayne
                            Fredericks</persName>, Deputy Assistant Secretary for African Affairs;

                        Defense representatives were William <persName corresp="#p_LWE_1">Lang</persName> and Col. Richard <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName>.

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">2.</hi> Maritime Operations<note n="2" xml:id="d427fn2">On April 1, <persName corresp="#p_FGD_1">Fields</persName> sent Deputy Director for Plans <persName corresp="#p_HRI_1">Helms</persName> a memorandum on the status of
                            maritime assets on Lake Tanganyika, reporting that there were currently
                            on the lake eight craft of various sizes belonging to the Congolese
                            Government. Five Agency-owned craft were scheduled for deployment on the
                            lake by April 5. (Ibid., Job 78–02502R, DDO/ISS Files, Box 1, [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] Operations (Jan.

                            memorandum to the 303 Committee reported that the five boats had been
                            covertly supplied to the Congolese Government by <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and placed on the lake. (National
                            Security Council, Intelligence Files, Congo 1960–1964)</note></p>
                    <p>With reference to the Country Team recommendation that two 50 foot Swift
                        boats be dispatched to Lake Tanganyika, <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                        described the problem of crewing these boats and stated that our only
                        immediate solution was to man them with 20–25 [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                            line not declassified</hi>] personnel who were familiar with boat
                        operations and specifically with the Swift. If this were agreed to, it would
                        be our understanding that the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] would be replaced with [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                            line not declassified</hi>] crews as quickly as such crews could be
                        recruited, trained and dispatched. However, it was noted that this would
                        require several months to accomplish and that such a time frame was
                        unacceptable in terms of our immediate needs. Mr. McElhiney stated that he
                        and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> had discussed
                        this matter with Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName> the morning of 26 August. Governor <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName> had <pb n="618" facs="0651" xml:id="pg_618"/>agreed to the dispatching of the craft but was
                        apprehensive about adding more [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] to the paramilitary program in the Congo. State
                        representatives present accepted the need for [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                            line not declassified</hi>] and agreed that if assured that every effort
                        would be made to replace [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] they would present this proposal to Assistant
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName>. <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> explained that in addition to the Swift,
                        it was our intent to add four seacraft to the four already present in
                        Albertville. Since this part of the proposal was not included in the Country
                        Team message, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>
                        questioned whether a total of eight seacraft was really necessary. After
                        some discussion of proposed utilization of the additional seacraft, it was
                        left that this would be reconsidered. There seemed to be no objection to
                        their use if they are really needed.</p>

                    <p>A. Addition of three T–28’s to present complement of 12. In response to a
                        proposal by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> and
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DLA_1">Devlin</persName> that the absolute minimum
                        number of T–28’s needed for air operations in the Congo is 15, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWE_1">Lang</persName> stated that although T–28D’s are
                        available, they are extremely difficult to come by and for budget reasons it
                        seemed unlikely that they could provide the three additional T–28’s. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_LWE_1">Lang</persName> noted that adding three
                        T–28’s would require a reduction in the <gloss target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss>
                        budget for the Congo. Such a reduction was unacceptable to Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>. The matter was left that
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWE_1">Lang</persName> would look further into the
                        matter and see whether some alternative solution was possible. He did,
                        however, spend considerable time describing the light aircraft—Cessna
                        206—presently being tested by the Air Force for use in counterinsurgency
                        operations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWE_1">Lang</persName> restated his
                        previous position that the 206 or a similar aircraft could replace the T–28.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DLA_1">Devlin</persName> noted that the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] pilots as well as
                        U.S. air operations officers in the Congo feel that the 206 is totally
                        inadequate for the job to be done and cannot replace the T–28.</p>
                    <p>B. <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> stated that with the withdrawal of
                        the C–130’s and the possible increase in <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> commitments as the result of any expanded maritime
                        operations program, an additional transport plane has become necessary.
                        Unless there were any serious objections on the part of State, we planned to
                        dispatch an additional C–46 to the Congo. It was agreed that the C–46 be
                        sent. There was discussion of the inadequate use by the Belgians of the
                        C–47’s presently in the Congo, but when boiled down, it appeared that we
                        must ask but doubted if we could get their support of the air and maritime
                        operations being run by the Agency. It was agreed that at the planned
                        meetings in Brussels with the Belgians, pressure would be put upon the
                        Belgian Government to result in better utilization of available air
                        transport in the Congo. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWE_1">Lang</persName>’s
                        office will prepare a paper on this topic.</p>
                    <pb n="619" facs="0652" xml:id="pg_619"/>
                    <p>C. With regard to replacement of the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] pilots, it was agreed that <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> would attempt to recruit European pilots immediately, and
                        that at the September meetings in Brussels the Belgians would be asked to
                        supply Belgian contract pilots for the 21st Squadron. If pilots could be
                        made available by the Belgians, T–28’s would be transferred to the 21st
                        Squadron as previously proposed by <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>D. In connection with U.S. air operations in the Congo, it was explained by
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> that in view of worldwide Agency
                        commitments, it was becoming difficult to continue providing air operations
                        officers for TDY assignment to the Congo. <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> stated that we would have to find some other solution to
                        obtaining air operations officers who were willing to remain for longer
                        periods of time. This generally involved allowing families to join air
                        operations officers and remain in Leopoldville. A possible solution could be
                        that the air operations officers would be dispatched TDY and allowed to have
                        their families in the Congo for the duration of their stay. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> felt this would create
                        considerable personnel problems. It was agreed that this matter would be
                        further discussed and some solution worked out in the field between
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DLA_1">Devlin</persName>.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">3.</hi> Ground Operations</p>
                    <p>In connection with ground operations note was made of the apparent lack of
                        unified direction of military operations in the Congo. The unfortunate pay
                        problem appeared to be hampering the Fifth Commando preparations for the
                        Fizi-Baraka campaign and seemed to be the result of mismanagement rather
                        than intentional obstruction. Noting a previous informal conversation with
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> on the subject,
                            <persName corresp="#p_DLA_1">Devlin</persName> mentioned the idea of
                        bringing Col. <persName corresp="#p_DWA_1">Dodds</persName> (now retired
                        from the U.S. Army) back to the Congo primarily to help out in Albertville.
                        It was observed that <persName corresp="#p_DWA_1">Dodds</persName> was well
                        received by Congolese military figures <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MGL_1">Mulamba</persName>
                        and could be of considerable assistance to Lt. Col. Michael Hoare in
                        planning and executing the campaign as well as coordinating the operation
                        with the local Congolese commanders and Belgian advisors. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> was receptive to the idea
                        but felt that he should first consult Col. <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName>, the <gloss target="#t_COMISH_1">COMISH</gloss>
                        chief. It was also agreed that if the idea has merit, General <persName corresp="#p_APD_1">Adams</persName> would have to be consulted. (Col.
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName> has since turned this
                        down.)</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">4.</hi> Political</p>
                    <p>Upon completion of discussions of paramilitary activity the Defense
                        Department representatives withdrew, and the discussions turned to political
                        matters. <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> presented the proposition that
                        in order to carry out the U.S. policy objectives of maintaining <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and <pb n="620" facs="0653" xml:id="pg_620"/><persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> in
                        tandem, we should be in a position to fund both factions on the
                        understanding that such funding would continue only as long as each faction
                        worked in agreement with the other. Specifically, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DLA_1">Devlin</persName> described our approach as the
                        following:</p>
                    <p>Contact with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> by <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] and in return for his agreement to do all possible to
                        support the present arrangement with <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>, we would offer him certain financial assistance.
                        It would be understood that the other faction would become aware of such
                        funding, and consideration would be given to advis-ing them shortly after
                        the offer to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. The <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> faction would be funded on the
                        same basis through General <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> on
                        the grounds that he is the one individual most nearly acceptable to both
                        contingencies.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> took issue with the
                        above proposal in strongest terms, stating that he was dead against giving
                        either side anything at this time. He was opposed to giving anything to
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> after his behavior with
                        Senator Dodd, i.e., end-running <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>. He felt that such funding would be clear evidence
                        that such end-running payed off and would be an encouragement to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to by-pass the Ambassador, thereby
                        making his position untenable. In addition he was equally dead set against
                        establishing any more channels to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> either by <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> or
                        others. He stated that he considered <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> his particular preserve, and that if anything should
                        happen to him, his <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> was fully able to
                        carry on the relationship. After considerable further discussion, the
                        meeting closed without any satisfactory conclusion. Mr. McElhiney did,
                        however, state that it was the Bureau’s position that the 303 Committee
                        should be requested to approve a contingency fund of [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] for use in maintaining a political
                        balance between the two factions.</p>
                    <p>The meeting resumed on 27 August. The matter of a <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>/<persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        relationship was reopened and with equal fervor Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> once more spoke out against the
                        proposal to establish another channel for <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to the U.S. Government, stating that he felt that
                        this was not in the best U.S. interest. Further discussions of this proposal
                        did not seem worthwhile. However, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FGD_1">Fields</persName> presented a proposal that we attempt, in any case, to
                        establish a controlled penetration of the <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> office by providing <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> with a public relations advisor. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DLA_1">Devlin</persName> reminded <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s request for such an advisor approximately a year
                        ago. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> stated that
                        he did not look favorably on such a proposal on the grounds that it would
                        not only not be effective, but would probably not be acceptable to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. After further discussion,
                        however, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> noted
                        that what <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> needed in the
                        worst way was a fully competent economist as an advisor, observing that
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> had from time to <pb n="621" facs="0654" xml:id="pg_621"/>time mentioned this problem to
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> stated that if we could come up
                        with a fluent French speaking economist with a good political head, he
                            (<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>) could offer such an
                        individual to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>The subject of a contingency fund was raised next by Mr. McElhiney who stated
                        that he had discussed this matter with Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName> and that it was acceptable to
                        him. It was agreed that all the matters discussed in the past two meetings
                        would be presented to Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName> for his concurrence, and that if the contingency
                        fund was still agreeable to <persName corresp="#p_WGM_1">Williams</persName>, the Agency would be asked to prepare a paper for the
                        303 Committee. The meeting concluded on this note.</p>

                    <p>1. The conflict between President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> that has been developing over the past few months
                        could lead to a serious deterioration of the situation in the Congo unless
                        kept within acceptable limits. If it erupted into an open confrontation
                        prior to the successful completion of the impending military campaign
                        against the Fizi-Baraka area, the last center of organized rebel military
                        strength, the stability of the Central Government could be severely
                        threatened. In addition, the Congolese rebels would be heartened and the
                        radical African States encouraged to return to their policy of active
                        interference in Congolese internal affairs. If <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> were forced out of the government, there is the
                        possibility of another Katanga secession. At the very least, his removal
                        would lead many European technicians and businessmen to leave the Congo,
                        with disastrous results for the country’s fragile administrative and
                        economic structure. If on the other hand <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> gained the upper hand there is an equally clear
                        possibility that members of the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>], feeling their personal security menaced, would make
                        some violent countermove.</p>
                    <p>2. It now appears that both parties to the dispute have concluded that for
                        the present at least the existing relationship should continue. However, it
                        is clear that rivalry and deep suspicion persist. Therefore, at recent
                        Washington discussions attended by representatives of the Department of
                        State and <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, including Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> Station Chief from Leopoldville, the
                        proposal was put forward and later approved by the Assistant Secretary of
                        State for African Affairs that a contingency fund of [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] be established, from which covert

                        avert an open confrontation. These payments would be made only with the
                        approval of the Ambassador at Leopoldville and <pb n="624" facs="0657" xml:id="pg_624"/>of the Department of State.<note n="2" xml:id="d430fn2">In his [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] letter to

                            October 9), the Chief of Station reported that the Station was

                            actions for moral and practical reasons. The Station, on the other hand,
                            was convinced that failure to engage in such operations was greatly
                            handicapping the achievement of U.S. objectives in the Congo. The Chief

                            decreased measurably in the past few months. (Central Intelligence

                        Furthermore, approval to make such payments would be requested only when
                        there existed a threat to the existing balance of power so serious as to
                        require immediate action to avert a major political crisis and possibly
                        another collapse of internal security throughout the Congo. The payments
                        would be made through certain long-established contacts of the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> Station who from past experience are
                        judged to be reliable and secure. The risk of embarrassment to the United

                    </list>
                    <p>On 13 August 1964, the 303 Committee approved a large scale program for
                        covert support to [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] and
                        selected Congolese leaders for the restoration of order in the Congo.</p>
                    <p>Although the rebels have not been able to establish any cohesion or permanent
                        country-wide appeal, the ability of the <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> regime to reestablish stability in areas many miles
                        away from Leopoldville is negligible. Main population centers have been
                        captured and garrisoned but outlying areas remain chaotic and filled with
                        marauding bands.</p>
                    <p>In recent weeks, rebel concentrations in the Fizi-Baraka area (see map)<note n="2" xml:id="d431fn2">None of the attachments is printed.</note> have
                        given grave concern to the State Department. These rebels are being supplied
                        across Lake Tanganyika by Russians and/or Chinese, and the rebel units are
                        well armed and undergoing extensive training by Cuban guerrillas.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> has made a beginning in interdicting
                        this support by the establishment of several boats based in Albertville to
                        harass this supply route. Because of the size of the lake (40 miles wide,
                        300 miles long) it has been determined that a more substantial pocket Coast
                        Guard is necessary. The 303 Committee approved on 23 September 65 the
                        purchase, transport by air, and armament and manning of six additional boats
                        (two swifts and four seacraft) at a cost of [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount
                            not declassified</hi>]. The only available nucleus of reliable covert
                        boat operators is presently [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>]. It is planned to eventually replace them with
                        Europeans. Mercenary adventurers and various Congolese tried thus far have
                        proved disastrous as to discipline and ability to carry out their missions,
                        to say nothing of maintaining the equipment.</p>
                    <p>Thus far, the pocket fleet has forced the rebels and their supporters to
                        operate at night. The addition of radar to the new boats will make rebel
                        runs more difficult, although intelligence reports indicate the Russians are
                        supplying the rebels with power launches of their own (see picture).
                        Diplomatic efforts to dissuade Tanzania from helping the rebels have not
                        proved successful to date.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> to work with

                                <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and appoint another
                            person. (Ibid., [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>], Fiche
                            49, Row 2, Frames 6–10, [<hi rend="italic">text not
                            declassified</hi>])</note></p>
                    <p>1. Current political impasse is result, to considerable extent, of <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> failure to play active role in
                        endeavoring mold political events. Per ref A it was predictable that [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] would go all out to
                        remove [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] from office in
                        absence of some guarantee of support by a major power. Leop continues
                        believe that it would have been possible to guide them and to avoid present
                        situation whereby there is odds on chance [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] will remove [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] from office.</p>
                    <p>2. Leop’s reasoning as follows:</p>
                    <pb n="629" facs="0662" xml:id="pg_629"/>
                    <p>A. [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] and many of their
                        allies suspect [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] is
                        seeking absolute political power. They also believe that if he achieves this
                        objective he will remove them from office and possibly physically liquidate
                        them. Thus they are determined to build a counter force.</p>
                    <p>B. Counter forces originally intended to limit [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] powers and to ensure [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] should be able play active role in any
                        future govt.</p>
                    <p>C. Although Leop warned [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>]
                        on many occasions that <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> was not
                        prepared to fund their activities, they continued to doubt this statement.
                        They were convinced that after nearly five years of close collaboration
                            <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> would not let them go down
                        the drain and would have need of them thus they gathered sufficient funds to
                        create a counterblock, assuming that once the bloc in existence, <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> would recognize its value and pick
                        up the check.</p>
                    <p>D. When <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> continued maintain
                        hands-off position, [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>]
                        panicked and concluded they would be unable to hold front Democratique
                        Congolais (FDC) together over prolonged period. They assumed, probably
                        correctly, that [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] would
                        bribe away sufficient votes to obtain an absolute majority in both houses of
                        parliament. Thus Leop believes [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not
                            declassified</hi>], minus [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] decided they must either act immediately to remove
                            [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] from office or risk
                        losing the battle. [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] who
                        remained confident that he could control [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] and if necessary use [<hi rend="italic">name not
                            declassified</hi>] to prevent his accession to [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] office, thus differed in
                        tactics from other [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>].</p>
                    <p>3. On basis above, Leop believes that had <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss> mounted political action ops, it would have been
                        relatively easy to control the general lines of [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym
                            not declassified</hi>] action. Also believe that our failure to act has
                        inadvertently contributed to encouraging [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not
                            declassified</hi>] to try to oust [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            1</persName>]. Similarly, we have limited our control of future events,
                        should [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] gain control of
                        govt or merely increase their strength within the govt, for they will not
                        feel beholden to us for their victory.</p>
                    <p>4. View above, as well as fact [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not
                            declassified</hi>] may soon be playing even more active role within
                        govt, Leop continues believe it would be advisable implement political
                        action program. The program should have two phases:</p>
                    <p>A. As first step would increase regular payments to [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>], [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 3</persName>], [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>], [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 4</persName>].
                        B. Second and concurrent phase would arrange for funding FDC via [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>], thus strengthening his position
                        with [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 4</persName>] and [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 3</persName>] on one hand and [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] on the other. Also would
                        implement phase only if [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>]
                        were to indicate his concurrence. Do not believe such related <pb n="630" facs="0663" xml:id="pg_630"/> action would influence [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] decision concerning whether or
                        not retain [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>]. However, on
                        off-chance [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] is
                        maintained, we could better guarantee cooperation between Conaco and FDC.
                        Should [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] be ousted assume
                        we would wish try control and moderate actions of new govt.</p>
                    <p>5. Have discussed above points with [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>]. However he continues believe, per ref D, it would
                        be inadvisable mount such operations. Difference between his view and those
                        of Station may be explained by difference our estimate of [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 4</persName>] and [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 3</persName>] basis previous experience,
                            [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] believes they can be influenced
                        and controlled insofar as major decisions are concerned. [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>] on other hand distrusts them and
                        doubts Leop ability exert control factor.</p>
                    <p>6. Recognize general outcome this problem probably will be determined by
                            [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>]. However submitting
                        these views for <gloss target="#t_HQS_1">HQS</gloss> info, as continue
                        believe failure play active role can only contribute to further
                        deterioration <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> position.</p>

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> is definitely out. So just
                        when the mercenaries are mopping up the last organized rebel remnants, we
                        have a real political mess on our hands. He refused to resign as <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> asked because he believed
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> would trick him and not
                        reappoint him. Neither had clear constitutional justification since they
                        were still working with a transitional government moving toward both
                        parliamentary (last spring) and presidential elections (early next

                    <p>Our push to keep them together failed because <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> just isn’t sensitive to the kind of leverage we
                        have. His main interest is staying in power, which he does by manipulating
                        the levers of tribal politics. He shows little concern for governing
                        sensibly, so he couldn’t care less whether we cut aid or pull out some
                        planes.</p>
                    <p>But <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> is far from finished.
                        He’s deciding this weekend whether to use his parliamentary majority to
                        block formation of the new government. We already have reports his party has
                        turned down offers of several ministries. So we might be in for a long
                        stalemate like the recent one in Greece.</p>
                    <p>Everyone expects <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to fight;
                        the $64 question is how. He can stay in <gloss target="#t_Leo_1">Leo</gloss>
                        and play out the game by constitutional rules. This weekend’s decision will
                        tell us whether he’s going to provoke a showdown right now or risk riding
                        along with <persName corresp="#p_KEV_1">Kimba</persName>’s government to
                        oppose <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> in the presidential
                        elections. He told <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> he doesn’t
                        intend to be a “force for disorder,” and he has tried to keep his followers
                        from reacting violently. Whether he risks waiting for the presidential
                        elections will depend on whether he thinks <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> will let him play out the political game without
                        jailing or exiling him. (His chief rival now is fast-rising and
                        opportunistic Interior Minister <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Nendaka</persName>, whose police could make life miserable.)</p>
                    <p>If <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> plays dirty, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> might try to use his mercenaries
                        and possibly some army units to mount a coup. Or if that course seems
                        blocked, he could go back to Katanga. In appointing <persName corresp="#p_KEV_1">Kimba</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> is obviously trying to preserve the
                        Leopoldville–Katanga “axis,” which holds together the Congo’s two main power
                        centers. However, though <pb n="632" facs="0665" xml:id="pg_632"/><persName corresp="#p_KEV_1">Kimba</persName> was <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s foreign minister during the Katanga secession, he
                        represents a Katanga minority and probably couldn’t hold Katanga against
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>.</p>
                    <p>How we operate will depend on <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s course. If he plays out the constitutional game, it
                        might well serve our interests if he unseats <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>. He’d probably do a much better job of governing.
                        On the other hand, we can’t back him in kicking off another civil war.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> has told his people to lie low
                        for the time being, and <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>
                        recommends we do the same. That’s probably wise as far as using <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> money is concerned. However, <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> sees <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                        regularly, and we have to have some notion of where we want to go. RWK and I
                        have been pressing State all week to begin some contingency thinking to give
                        us a clearer picture of our options and their merits. They’ve held off so
                        far, waiting to see how the new government turns out. In the interim
                            <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> is simply telling
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> not to bring the house
                        down.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> and RWK will talk Congo with

                        the political turnover, but the aid problem is still basic.</p>
                    <p>Unhappily <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s ouster puts us in
                        an uncomfortable position with Dodd. We can stand up for past policy, but
                        he’s at least on good told-you-so ground if we decide to let <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> go after <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>. Our argument is that our
                        interest is to see the game played out constitutionally and only now has
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> had a chance to

                    <p>428. At opening meeting joint US-Belgian discussions Congo attention
                        primarily directed to political situation resulting from dismissal <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> Parliamentary speech causes
                        concern for several reasons. First was brutal manner <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> dismissed. Second is absence any
                        mention rebellion at all coupled with no mention job <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> doing. Third was willingness go to Accra
                        while entirely omitting any mention <gloss target="#t_OCAM_1">OCAM</gloss>.
                        He thought <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> had reacted well.
                        Surprised at choice <persName corresp="#p_KEV_1">Kimba</persName> and
                        considers it form of defiance to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. Foreign affairs seems to have played little part in
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> action; basically it
                        has been struggle for power with astute <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> once again getting rid of PriMin who threatened
                        take on more power. But one result may have been some deflection foreign
                        policy; this needs careful assessment.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH_1">Spaak</persName> referred to just-received press
                        reports of <persName corresp="#p_KEV_1">Kimba</persName> cabinet. Was
                        surprised to see names close <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        associates, especially Kibwi and Litho. Wondered if their presence means
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> split is as wide as we had all
                        assumed or whether some long-term deal in offing. As for reaction, suggested
                        we wait a bit to see what develops as there no guarantee <persName corresp="#p_KEV_1">Kimba</persName> govt will receive Parliamentary
                        approval. Said Belgium concerned by several points in addition to those
                        raised by <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> speech. First is
                        manner <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> action and fact he
                        had misinformed <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> of his plans. Second is
                        question Belgian technicians. Already some of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> advisers being thrown out of Congo. If this extends
                        to men like Cordy, in whom <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> has much
                        trust, situation would become difficult. <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> already reacting against these expulsions and will take
                        firm line. In this case what happens to Delperdange mission and
                        administrative teams? There has been economic stagnation in past 3–4 months,
                        and situation worsening. Concluded with statement we can make no firm
                        decisions now on aid for the future. Must involve <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> but more important make point to Congolese that aid is not
                        a right but given as assistance to serious govt.</p>
                    <p>Gov. <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> agreed with general

                        study situation closely and be prepared to continue joint efforts in Congo.
                        Military situation has improved and border control more effective with East

                        matters, we hope period ahead will not see settling old accounts among
                        political antagonists, thus providing basis subsequent disorders. In this
                        regard, we can only applaud <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s reported pledge of support to <persName corresp="#p_KEV_1">Kimba</persName> (AFP today) based on principle of

                    <p>As the toughest Congo-fighter of them all, you’re the one with whom I want to
                        share my mounting worries.</p>
                    <p>I feel in my bones that, just as we close off the tag end of the last
                        rebellion, we’re sliding into another all too familiar political crunch that
                        could tear the Congo wide open again.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> is not just going to sit back
                        and bide his time. He’ll probably try either: (1) to gain power legitimately
                        by running for President or scaring <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> into making him <gloss target="#t_PM_1">PM</gloss>
                        again; (2) run a coup while his <gloss target="#t_SA_1">SA</gloss>
                        mercenaries are still around; or (3) retreat again toward Katanga
                        separatism, perhaps as a threat to get him back into power in <gloss target="#t_Leo_1">Leo</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Nendaka</persName> are proceeding apace to box in
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, and playing with the
                        dangerous idea of seeking radical African support against what they may
                        believe is US/Belgian support of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. When the Belgians (with our backing) tell the
                            <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> that we won’t give any new
                        economic aid unless it puts its financial house in order this will
                        powerfully reinforce their suspicions. Now <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>’s return adds to the confusion. In sum, a new
                        struggle for power is already well underway.</p>
                    <p>I suspect <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> will be at us and
                        Brussels shortly to back him. Tom Dodd will doubtless weigh in too. We’ll be
                        confronted soon with a policy decision on whether to: (a) press for a
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> reconciliation; (b) back <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>; (c) back legitimacy and let the
                        chips fall where they may.</p>
                    <p>The last course has many attractions, but I doubt that it will give us or
                        Belgium the reasonably stable Congo toward which we at least are
                        contributing over $50 million a year.</p>
                    <p>So without prejudice to our ultimate decision, wouldn’t you agree that we
                        should start contingency planning now to anticipate this problem. Otherwise
                        we’re at the mercy of the Congolese.</p>

                    <p>This memorandum contains a request for approval of the continuation of covert
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> participation in the Congolese

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">2.</hi> Problem</p>
                    <p>The Congolese Government is faced with the formidable task of restoring
                        political and economic stability to the rebel-ravaged eastern and
                        northeastern sections of the Congo. Rebel bands and gangs of outlaws still
                        move freely through much of the area, harassing lines of communication and
                        attacking isolated villages. Relative security exists only in those towns
                        garrisoned by government troops. The area involved is so extensive and the
                        resources of the Central Government in dependable troops are so limited that
                        the use of aircraft will for some time to come be essential for discouraging
                        anti-government activity.</p>
                    <p>In an effort to crush the last organized rebel resistance in the eastern
                        Congo, Central Government forces are engaged in a major campaign in the
                        Fizi-Baraka area. Even assuming these forces will be successful in achieving
                        their major objectives, we can expect persisting disorder there, as
                        elsewhere in territory once under rebel control.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">3.</hi> Factors Bearing on the
                        Problem</p>
                    <p>a. <hi rend="italic">Origin of the Requirement</hi></p>
                    <p>On 13 December 1962, the 303 Committee approved a proposal to provide
                        additional personnel and logistical support to the Congolese Air Force in
                        order to give it a limited combat capability, on the condition that the
                        State Department determined that such action was compatible with overall
                        U.S. policy for the Congo. The proposal had its origin in the need to
                        provide air support for Congolese National Army troops then operating in the
                        eastern Congo against Katanga. Subsequent to the approval, it was determined
                        that Congolese Air Force units covertly supported under this program should
                        engage only in flights of a morale or reconnaissance nature. On 30 January
                        1964, this <pb n="638" facs="0671" xml:id="pg_638"/>limited mission was
                        modified with the approval of the Department of State, to one of active
                        participation in combat, to meet the need of the Congolese Government for
                        extensive air support against the rebels in Kwilu Province.</p>
                    <p>On 28 May 1964, the 303 Committee approved a marked increase in the number of
                        planes to be made available to the Congolese Government still fighting the
                        rebellion in Kwilu Province, and faced with new uprisings in Kivu. The
                        Department of Defense and the Department of State requested <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> to provide the necessary personnel to
                        operate and maintain the additional planes.</p>
                    <p>The program was again expanded with 303 Committee approval on 24 August 1964,
                        when rebellion throughout the eastern half of the Congo threatened the
                        existence of the Central Government. Subsequently, on 6 April 1965, a
                        periodic report was forwarded to the 303 Committee advising it of a
                        budgetary adjustment which brought the level of support for the program to
                        an estimated [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] for
                            <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1965.</p>
                    <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Pertinent U.S. Policy Considerations</hi></p>
                    <p>It is U.S. policy to support the present Congolese Government in its efforts
                        to defeat the rebels, who have in the past received external support from
                        the Soviet Union, Communist China, Cuba and the radical African states.
                        Recent events indicate, however, that African assistance to the rebels has
                        greatly diminished. President Nyerere of Tanzania has privately expressed
                        his disillusionment with the rebel leadership and stated his intention of
                        halting Soviet, Communist Chinese and Cuban assistance to rebels in refuge
                        on Tanzanian territory.</p>
                    <p>c. <hi rend="italic">Operational Objectives</hi></p>
                    <p>The major operational objective of the tactical air support program is to
                        give the Congolese Air Force an adequate capability to support, through
                        reconnaissance and combat action, the Congolese National Army in its efforts
                        to destroy rebel resistance and restore order in the countryside.</p>
                    <p>d. <hi rend="italic">Cover Considerations</hi></p>
                    <p>To reduce to a minimum the visibility of the U.S. official presence in the
                        Congo, efforts have been made to present this program as one sustained and
                        directed by the Congolese Government. The pilots are ostensibly hired by
                        that government. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]
                        The combat aircraft are supplied through the Military Assistance Program.
                        Support aircraft are overtly leased by the Congolese Government [<hi rend="italic">2½ lines not declassified</hi>]. While these cover
                        mechanisms have served to disguise, to some extent, U.S. official
                        involvement, the necessary use of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] pilots and of American air officers has led to a
                        general assumption in the Congo, reflected from time to time in the <pb n="639" facs="0672" xml:id="pg_639"/>international press, that this is
                        in fact a U.S. Government program. However, there has been little comment
                        linking it with the U.S. Government in recent months.</p>
                    <p>e. <hi rend="italic">Risks Involved</hi></p>
                    <p>Despite the decreased press interest, the widespread assumption that the
                        United States is responsible for the program means that it continues to be
                        potentially embarrassing for the U.S. Government.</p>
                    <p>f. <hi rend="italic">Alternative Courses of Action</hi></p>
                    <p>In September 1965, U.S. Government proposals made to representatives of the
                        Belgian Government in Brussels, that the Belgians assume responsibility for
                        the tactical air support program, were rejected for political and financial
                        reasons, despite a U.S. offer to transfer the T–28’s now in the Congo to
                        Belgian control and to maintain the support facility for several months.
                        Nevertheless, these proposals were raised again during the October 1965
                        talks in Washington but to date with no more favorable response from the
                        Belgians than previously.</p>

                        to review (1) if talks with the Belgians result in Belgian agreement to
                        assume all or part of this support, and/or (2) if actions by the new

                        overly optimistic as to what it alone can accomplish in reducing insurgency
                        and achieving pacification in the countryside. To achieve such an objective
                            <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss> would have to approach it on
                        a scale similar to that employed in Vietnam. As recognize this not
                        realistic, recommend <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss> funds and
                        assets be limited to developing ops intel (there is no place in Congo Govt
                        where detailed information on this problem is pulled together); developing
                        access to tribal leaders for purpose of convincing them to lay groundwork
                        for large program of pacification; funding spot requirements (such as
                        provision of small number of arms, key foodstuffs, etc); trying influence
                        key <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> leaders to launch and implement
                        overall program of pacification (economic and military) and providing
                        technical guidance to responsible <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>
                        officials in implementing any such program. However, implementation of any

                    <p>490. Following represents our tentative thinking and guidance on present
                        Congolese situation. <persName corresp="#p_KEV_1">Kimba</persName>
                        government was successfully and rather speedily formed, it is functioning,
                        apparently with public acquiescence, and may gain parliamentary approval. We
                        will want to maintain influence with government in accordance our legitimate
                        interests and scope our assistance. We should therefore be prepared to do
                        business as before on basis our past policy of support for unity of Congo
                        and legitimate national government in power.</p>
                    <p>So far <persName corresp="#p_KEV_1">Kimba</persName> has given series of
                        satisfactory policy assurances; performance is yet to be measured. He has
                        indicated mercenaries are still necessary, he desires improved relations
                        with other Africans, he welcomes African assistance but not intervention in
                        Congo and he believes European technicians will be essential for
                        considerable time. These statements are in accord with our general policies.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEV_1">Kimba</persName> appears realistic
                        concerning both internal and external problems, with his greatest merit
                        residing in his understanding of and attitude toward rebellion and necessary
                        rehabilitation afterward.</p>
                    <pb n="643" facs="0676" xml:id="pg_643"/>
                    <p>This analysis adds up to policy of cooperation with <persName corresp="#p_KEV_1">Kimba</persName> so long as he retains confidence
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> on one hand and can
                        resist parliamentary encroachments his power on other. While we want
                        Belgians to continue to take lead in Congo and, in fact, to step up their
                        assumption of responsibilities, we would not want necessarily to follow lead
                        they have taken vis-à-vis <persName corresp="#p_KEV_1">Kimba</persName>
                        because their discouragement with <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>.</p>
                    <p>With regard to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, given unknown
                        magnitude his parliamentary and popular support at present, as well as
                        possibility he may someday return to power, we should continue our contact
                        with him and urge him to play game within “role provided for in framework
                        constitutional system.”</p>
                    <p>As to foreign advisers, we cannot deplore departure of some. It would seem
                        advisable for us not to take attitude <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>
                        cannot expel Belgian technicians per se but rather to use our potential
                        influence in cases of individuals (such as possibly Brassine) whose
                        continued presence of great importance to <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Our attitude toward <persName corresp="#p_KEV_1">Kimba</persName> government
                        and <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> subject to evolution
                        imposed by circumstances, but, bearing in mind that <persName corresp="#p_KEV_1">Kimba</persName>’s fortunes can fluctuate
                        momentarily, we see no objection (or alternative) to dealing with him
                        frankly and confidently on assumption <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>’s past policies will not change radically to detriment our
                        goals or interests. It includes impressing on him and other Congo leaders
                        necessity of continued vigorous action against rebels and of financial and
                        economic measures essential to Congo progress. It also includes efforts to
                        associate <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> as closely as
                        possible with <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> decisions and
                        policies.</p>
                    <p>Good working relationship with <persName corresp="#p_KEV_1">Kimba</persName>
                        would also, we hope, help dampen efforts by others to engage in
                        nonproductive, devious politics with various African factions. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> still appears to provide strongest

                    <p>The third round of the <hi rend="italic">Congo’s political imbroglio</hi> has
                        just started. After losing his job in the first, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> came back in the second to block
                        parliamentary approval of <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>’s
                        candidate. Now <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> has
                        announced he’ll resubmit the same candidate.</p>
                    <p>Since <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> is staking a lot on
                        sticking to his guns, <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> fears
                        he may turn loose his police to arrest enough <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> backers (or even <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> himself) to tip the balance. That would force a
                        quick showdown. I think he’s more likely just to stall past the parliament’s
                        early December adjournment date and ride with a caretaker government either
                        until he sees things going his way or until the February presidential
                        election. Our only indication so far which way the battle will turn is an
                        unconfirmed British report that <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> decided earlier this week not to jail <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> yet.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> has confined himself to
                        commending <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s restraint,
                        warning <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>’s people against
                        strong-arm tactics and trying to find someone in the caretaker government to
                        do business with. The Belgians are staying on the fringes of the fight too,
                        and there may be little more we can do in this melee. Our aid doesn’t buy us
                        much when <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> puts his own
                        political future above the Congo’s mounting economic problems.</p>
                    <p>However, if the game gets rougher, we’ll face some tough, quick decisions.
                        The hardest would be how to react if <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> ends up in jail. Even if <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> shies away from that kind of
                        showdown now, we’ll at least have to decide who, if anyone, to bet on in the
                        presidential race. Since the pipeline of our import program is almost dry,
                        we will have some leverage that the Congolese business community and the
                        more sensible politicians will understand, even if <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> doesn’t. On the military front,
                        the likely departure of Rhodesian and South African mercenaries mid-December
                        could allow a few limited rebel successes while the Belgians find
                        replacements, so Belgian-US military aid might be worth something.</p>
                    <p>I readily admit the Congo often limps along despite our worst fears. However,
                        RWK and I have consistently worn our most worried <pb n="646" facs="0679" xml:id="pg_646"/>faces in State, because this one is worth running
                        scared on. Largely to look as if they’re worrying too, they’re turning out
                        some contingency plans to clarify our options, but we’ll continue to look
                            gloomy.<note n="2" xml:id="d445fn2">A handwritten notation at the bottom

                    <p>1. After a general discussion of political situation with <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> on 19 Nov, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> turned to <persName corresp="#p_DLA_1">Devlin</persName> and stated he wished seek latter’s
                        personal advice. He emphasized he speaking to <persName corresp="#p_DLA_1">Devlin</persName> as friend and not as <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> rep and insisted that latter not discuss with anyone
                        matters which he wished to raise. After preface, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> stated following:</p>
                    <p>A. Both <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KEV_1">Kimba</persName> have requested he place <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> under house arrest. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has refused carry out this request
                        (it never phrased as direct order). He added that both <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Nendaka</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> favor this solution and said he no longer fully
                        trusts them.</p>
                    <p>B. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_DLA_1">Devlin</persName> if he realized seriousness of
                        present solution. Without waiting for answer he added that current political
                        crisis is rapidly coming to a head and expressed view there does not seem to
                        be any easy solution. He stressed that <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>’s popularity is waning but also said he could never
                        bring himself to serve under <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, were latter to become president. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> explained that he considers
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to be an opportunist and
                        liar. He also added that were <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> to become president, it would place Congo in hands
                        of wrong type of Belgians and thus would eventually lead to new racial
                        crisis.</p>
                    <pb n="647" facs="0680" xml:id="pg_647"/>
                    <p>C. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> stated that on 17 Nov,
                        after luncheon for General Stone, Congolese officers present remained after
                        departure of American group and recommended that army intervene in current
                        political crisis to avoid an explosion. Those present were Colonel David
                        Nzoigba, commanding officer of second groupement headquarters in <gloss target="#t_Leo_1">Leo</gloss>; Lt Colonel Fredinand Malila, chief of
                        staff of <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>; and Lt Colonel Nonore
                        Nkalufa, G–3 of <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>. These officers stated
                        that, while army wants to maintain parliament and various provincial
                        assemblies in being, they see no solution to current conflict between
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. Thus, they asked <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> if it would not be possible for
                        army to resolve conflict, possibly by eliminating offices of president and
                        prime minister and for army to give central direction to govt formed by
                        parliamentarians. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> added that
                        on following day he met with his senior paratroop officers. He said these
                        officers also urged him find solution to current political problem.</p>
                    <p>D. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> stressed he does not repeat
                        not wish to stage another coup d’etat. However said he believes it to be his
                        duty to try find compromise solution to current political impasse. Thus, he
                        asked <persName corresp="#p_DLA_1">Devlin</persName> if he could suggest a
                        solution.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_DLA_1">Devlin</persName> replied that he concurred
                        with the general’s view that compromise solution would be required if Congo
                        is to avoid another political crisis which can only advance cause of rebels
                        and other extremist groups. He also insisted upon need to find a place in
                        govt for <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, pointing out that
                        elimination of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> from
                        political scene would almost certainly increase problem, rather than resolve
                        it. <persName corresp="#p_DLA_1">Devlin</persName> also concurred with
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s views that <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>’s popularity has diminished
                        sharply over last month. <persName corresp="#p_DLA_1">Devlin</persName>
                        concluded by stating one possible alternative would be for <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> to select compromise candidate for
                        presidency, one who would be responsive and acceptable to both FDC and
                        Conaco, and for <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> then to
                        convince <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> that for good of
                        country he must agree to such compromise and accept position of prime
                        minister.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> stated that he would want
                        to discuss this problem again with <persName corresp="#p_DLA_1">Devlin</persName>, probably on Sunday 21 Nov, but again stressed that
                        he wished <persName corresp="#p_DLA_1">Devlin</persName>’s personal views
                        and he asked that conversation not be discussed with Embassy or
                        Washington.</p>
                    <p>4. Station concurs that present political impasse is rapidly reaching
                        critical stage. Neither FDC nor Conaco has actual or lasting parlimentary
                        majority. Balance is such that either side could win a narrow majority by
                        purchasing a few votes. On other hand, <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> appears to be most popular leader in country.
                        However, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has repeatedly
                        stressed that he would never agree to work under <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. At 19 Nov meeting he again stated
                        he would resign were <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> elected
                        president. Since Station knows of no satisfactory alternative to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> as <pb n="648" facs="0681" xml:id="pg_648"/>commander of army, and in view of <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s long-time cooperation with <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> we do not believe that a solution which
                        would remove <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> from
                        governmental scene would be advisable. Thus, Station believes it is
                        incumbent upon <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> to try help <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> find compromise solution. Failure
                        to take this step would, in long run, almost certainly lead to even greater
                        political crisis and contribute to undermining seriously <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> position in Congo.<note n="3" xml:id="d446fn3">Telegram 2408 from Leopoldville to <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, November 19, transmitted a message

                    <p>2436 (In 99421). Ref Leop 2429 (In 99075).<note n="2" xml:id="d448fn2">Resume
                            of current political situation. [Footnote in the original.] In telegram
                            2429 from Leopoldville to <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, November
                            21, the Station reported that the political crisis was coming to a head
                            rapidly. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> appeared to be
                            the most popular political figure in the Congo, while <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>’s popularity had diminished
                            sharply since his open break with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> in mid-October. Within parliament, the two major
                            groups, <gloss target="#t_CONACO_1">CONACO</gloss> and the FDC, were
                            nearly equal in strength so it was unlikely that either could elect a
                            president with a strong majority, and compromise would be difficult
                            because so few of the Congolese leaders trusted each other. The Station
                            also expressed concern because, in the absence of U.S. financing, which
                            the [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] confidently
                            expected after the Chief of Station’s return, the <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>–FDC group had been gradually
                            drifting left. (Ibid.)</note></p>
                    <p>1. [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] visited [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] briefly 21 Nov. During brief conversation
                        he made following points:</p>
                    <p>A. He calling two day meeting beginning 24 Nov of six group commanders plus
                        senior staff officers and commanders Thysville camp, paratrooper instruction
                        center and Kitona base. Purpose of meeting is to obtain general consensus of
                        army opinion concerning present political impasse.</p>
                    <pb n="650" facs="0683" xml:id="pg_650"/>
                    <p>B. He extremely upset over absence <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> rep
                        during ChiRep vote in <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss>. He repeatedly
                        remarked that there something rotten in Denmark and that he could not
                        understand how Congo had failed support its friends, as well as to defend
                        its own natural position, during this vote.</p>
                    <p>C. He repeated his concern re [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            1</persName>] lack of initiative and commented that latter’s popularity
                        has diminished sharply. However he again stressed his lack of trust in
                            [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>].</p>
                    <p>D. He repeated statements previously made concerning his distrust of the
                        Brazza govt (GOCB) and expressed worry concerning probability that GOCB will
                        endeavor to subvert <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>.<note n="3" xml:id="d448fn3">In telegram 2444 from Leopoldville, November 22, the
                            Chief of Station reported that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> told him that morning that <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Nendaka</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AJE_1">Anany</persName> had received a payment of 2.5
                            million <gloss target="#t_BCF_1">BCF</gloss> when they first visited
                            Brazzaville to reestablish relations and had been promised an equivalent
                            sum every month for political expenses involved in defeating <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> said that he considered this a subversive
                            movement by the Brazzaville government against the Congolese Government.
                            The Chief of Station emphasized the danger of the present situation,
                            pointing out that although the payments were relatively small now,
                            eventually many Congolese ministers and political leaders could be on
                            the Brazzaville payroll. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                            recognized that such payments must come from the Chinese Communists or
                            Soviets. He also stated that <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> would almost certainly be a loser in his
                            political conflict with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>,
                            but, the Chief of Station noted, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> was still not ready to accept the fact that he
                            should reach a political understanding with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and drop <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>. (Ibid.)</note> Needless to say Leop encouraged
                        him in his view.</p>
                    <p>2. In reply [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] questions concerning
                        steps, if any, [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] plans take
                        at upcoming meeting in effort achieve solution to present political crisis,
                            [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] stressed that much will
                        depend upon outcome of his talks. He made it clear that he must use this
                        meeting to try ensure loyal army support. (Unfortunately [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] had only few minutes and thus
                            [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] was unable review alternatives
                        with him as outlined para 3 ref.)</p>
                    <p>[<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] said he believes it
                        imperative that he have funds at his disposition for passage to senior
                        officers. Said these funds would be used to ensure their personal loyalty
                        and for distribution to officers and key enlisted men at all army commands.
                        Also funds would be used to purchase certain personal items for troops in
                        combat areas such as soap, razor blades, etc. Specifically he asked for CF
                        thirty nine million, explaining that he would give CF five million to each
                        group commander and CF three million to Thysville, Kitona and paratrooper
                        training center commands.</p>
                    <p>3. Leop discussed above request with [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>] who concurs that [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] remains key element in our effort to achieve a
                        peaceful and workable solution in present crisis. Both Leop and [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>] believe <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> should accede to [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] request with caveat that none of
                            <pb n="651" facs="0684" xml:id="pg_651"/>these funds be employed to fund
                        specific candidates, politicians or parties. While both [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>] and Leop believe it would not be
                        advisable for [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] to pay out
                        such a large sum in one payment, request authority expend equivalent of up
                        to USD one hundred thousand for this purpose. Tentatively, Leop plans
                        recommend that [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] give CF two
                        or possibly two and one half million to each group and one million to three

                        available if and when necessary. View fact events moving rapidly and could
                        move even more rapidly here, [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>] and Leop desire have sufficient flexibility to meet
                        emergency funding needs for [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>]. If funds approved, will naturally consult <gloss target="#t_HQS_1">HQS</gloss> in advance making any additional
                        expenditures beyond CF 18 million if time and events permit, but wish stress
                        importance we attach to having this funding authority for [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>].</p>
                    <p>4. [Embassy] and Station convinced that [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s] continued control over army is essential to
                        implementation <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss>’s Congo policy.
                        Also wish stress importance we attach to finding an early solution to
                        present impasse. At present no one is devoting any time or attention to even
                        the most serious counter-insurgency, military, economic or social problems.
                        In short, the country is going to hell in a hand basket. All efforts are
                        devoted to political in-fighting. Thus an eventual solution to long term
                        Congo problems depends upon resolving immediate political problem. Leop and
                        [Embassy] believe [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] is best,
                        and possibly only, person on whom <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss>
                        can depend to find satisfactory solution. Failure answer his request for
                        funds would obviously weaken his position and could result in his inability
                        to achieve a solution. This, in turn, could leave way open for extremists
                        who appear to be moving even more rapidly than expected. In this respect,
                        Leop wishes note that in its opinion over past year <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> influence has diminished
                        proportionately to <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> refusal to
                        take positive position supplemented by active covert support in seeking
                        solutions to the admittedly tiresome and frustrating Congo problem. Leop
                        convinced that, had we earlier entered arena in covert capacity, current
                        crisis might have been avoided or at very least would have been greatly
                        attenuated. Also submit [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s]
                        requests for funds may well be our last opportunity to influence outcome of
                        events in Congo.</p>

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>’s request that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> jail <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Nendaka</persName>’s simultaneous trumpeting of Belgian plot charges now
                        looks like a hand-in-hand ploy to frame <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> as an enemy of the Congo. The immediate crisis could
                        still break either of two ways:</p>
                    <p>1. This first test of strength may already be over. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s refusal may have convinced
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> that jailing <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> now would backfire; Kasa must know
                        that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> is under pressure to
                        unseat him. Kasa’s ploy was not phrased as an order and is not public, so he
                        can back off from it without losing face. Reports this morning suggest that
                            <gloss target="#t_CONACO_1">CONACO</gloss> has decided to take part in a
                        government of national union and that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> is talking with FDC leaders along these lines. So
                        the current political impasse could break into a government that would
                        preside over longer term maneuvering leading toward the presidential
                        election.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> may push ahead by having
                            <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Nendaka</persName> jail him. In doing this,
                        he would risk a coup by <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and
                        (of less concern to him) suspension of US and Belgian aid. He should also
                        realize that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> is popular so
                        jailing him could provoke a boomerang reaction. Even if Kasa decides not to
                        act now, he could continue laying the groundwork for jailing <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> when the time is riper.</p>
                    <p>If Kasa jails <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, our choice
                        will be between simply suspending all our programs and going farther to back
                        a <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> coup. We could easily
                        suspend aid on grounds that it’s wasted under present circumstances. Whether
                        we could justify backing a coup would probably depend on how good a case we
                        could muster that the coup was necessary to restore constitutional
                        government. In any case, we’d probably end up opposing the radical Africans
                        again because Kasa has been working feverishly to bring them to his help in
                        just such an emergency. We just don’t know how tough a combination that
                        would be to beat, though its prospects are ugly enough to underscore the
                        importance of trying to head things off from going that far. So one
                        important job to be <pb n="653" facs="0686" xml:id="pg_653"/>done right now
                        is for <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> to make clear to Kasa
                        that he won’t get away with jailing <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>.</p>
                    <p>What are our choices over the next few months if we get out of this mess
                        whole?</p>
                    <p>1. We can back legitimacy. This is what Dodd accuses us of doing—hands-off,
                        let the Congolese fight it out. This would leave us flexible to cut off aid
                        if <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> goes to jail or to aid
                        him covertly to win a “free” election. But it wouldn’t necessarily assure us
                        that the best man would end up running the Congo.</p>
                    <p>2. We can back <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. He looks like
                        the best man to govern, but there are disadvantages too. The greatest of
                        these right now is that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                        wouldn’t buy him as president, though the general is drifting in that
                        direction.</p>
                    <p>3. We can back <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>. We could
                        either back him in a coup or let him put together the best formula he can
                        and get behind it. This is where I come out for the moment (as does
                            <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>). He is already our man.
                        He controls the army (with our help). He has shown himself the most sensible
                        leader in the current mess. At the moment, he knows the ins and outs of the
                        situation better than we do.</p>
                    <p>So I’d recommend shifting our current tactics slightly away from banking so
                        much (as <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> and State seem to be
                        doing) on <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>’s talk with
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>. I’d also recommend
                        going back to the tougher line <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> recommended. With authority in hand to talk about the
                        end of our aid, <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> should have a
                        frank talk with <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>. This isn’t
                        radically different from what we’re doing, but thinking this way does (a)
                        make doubly important the case that will be made to 303 (much as I
                        personally hate to think we have to spend our money this way) and (b) focus
                        our pressures on the guy who can accomplish most rather than hoping for too
                        much from Kasa (other than making a record with him).</p>

                        <item>24 September 1965 Request for Contingency Authority for a Program of
                            Action to Maintain an Equilibrium between Congo President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and Premier <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName></item>
                    </list>
                    <p>1. On 7 October 1965 the 303 Committee considered reference request for a
                            [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] contingency fund
                        to maintain a political balance between President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and the then Premier <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. At this meeting the 303 Committee
                        authorized a reduced contingency fund of [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount
                            not declassified</hi>] with the understanding that additional funds
                        could be obtained at a later date should the need arise.</p>
                    <p>2. Events moved quickly in the Congo and on 12 October 1965 <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> was dismissed from his post as
                        Premier by President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>.
                        However, a payment of [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                        declassified</hi>] was made to General <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> on 26 October in recognition of his efforts in
                        support of the U.S. aim of maintaining the <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        team even though his efforts had not been successful. This payment was
                        considered desirable and necessary by the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and the U.S. Ambassador to the Congo since <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> had used his own official funds in
                        his attempts to stop the break between <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>.</p>
                    <p>3. The political situation in the Congo remains critical even though
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> is no longer Premier and
                        the basic conflicts between <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>
                        and his group and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> continue
                        to threaten to throw the Congo into chaos if some solution to the problem is
                        not soon found. General <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has
                        emerged as perhaps the one man, by virtue of his position as Commander of
                        the Army and his understanding of the realities of the Congolese internal
                        and political situation, who can possibly take steps toward assuring a
                        balance between the opposing political leaders. Further, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> remains the best man to head the
                        military forces in the Congo and to act as a balance wheel between the
                        contending political leaders.</p>
                    <pb n="655" facs="0688" xml:id="pg_655"/>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> is presently concerned by
                        reactions of his senior military area commanders to the state of political
                        unrest in the Congo. The recent dealings of the <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> government with radical African countries such as
                        Ghana and Congo (Brazzaville) together with their requests to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> be placed under arrest for unconstitutional
                        activities while he was Premier, have created a situation wherein the senior
                        officers believe that military rule might be preferable to continued
                        political strife. On 21 November 1965 he made a request to <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> for $100,000 to enable him to make
                        payments to these officers to assure their loyalty to him and keep them from
                        taking any unilateral action in connection with the political situation.
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and the Bureau of African Affairs
                        with the Ambassador’s recommendation supported this request and approval has
                        been granted to the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> field
                        representative to make an immediate covert payment of [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> under authority previously granted by the 303
                        Committee. This amount will exhaust the [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not

                    <p>5. Since the political balance in the Congo is even graver now than in
                        September and October of 1965, it is requested that the 303 Committee
                        approve an expanded program at an additional cost of [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>]. This amount would allow for the
                        passage of an additional [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not

                        State as necessary to maintain stability in the Congo.</p>
                    <p>6. The proposal has the concurrence of the Bureau of African Affairs of the

                        heading into dangerous waters in their involvement with Communist dominated

                            Leopoldville reported that the Chief of Station met with [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] that morning and told him
                            he was alienating the U.S. and other foreign governments, which until
                            recently had regarded him as a moderate and constructive Congolese
                            leader. The Chief of Station brought up the allegation that <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Nendaka</persName> had received 2.5 million

                            Chief of Station pointed out that Kasvuubu would need tremendous funds
                            for his reelection campaign and that such funds would only be
                            forthcoming from the Soviets or Chinese Communists if <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> agreed to take the Congo into

                            agreed and asked for the Chief of Station’s personal advice. The latter
                            said that he doubted <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>
                            could win reelection [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>].

                    <p>2. [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] line might be that while political
                        conflict in Congo was between two moderate political factions <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> viewed it as internal affair and
                        thus felt it improper to take sides in the natural and legal interplay of
                        political forces. Now appears as a result largely of [<hi rend="italic">name
                            not declassified</hi>] own initiatives with the left that conflict is
                        moving away from internal politics and approaching a confrontation between
                        east and west. When such a situation develops [<hi rend="italic">name not
                            declassified</hi>] can easily understand that <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> must take sides. Thus at that point,
                        despite the long and mutually profitable association which we have had with
                            [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] and his colleagues,
                            <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> would be forced to take
                        all-out action against former friends and throw full effective support on
                        the opposing side.</p>
                    <p>3. [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] could explain to [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] that his recent actions are extremely
                        dangerous but that there is still time for him to pull back and salvage the
                        situation. If he does not he is lost both ways, since even if his group wins
                        it will do so only with Communist backing and [<hi rend="italic">name not
                            declassified</hi>] should know full well where that will lead. If the
                        opposing faction wins [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] and his
                        group will have irrevocably lost the support of their former <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> friends and natural allies.</p>

                    <p>B. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> repeatedly stressed that,
                        in conjunction with army, he had overthrown govt in order avoid prolonged
                        political crisis which, in his opinion, would have eventually led to chaos
                        and redounded to profit only rebels and would have also resulted in major
                        economic crisis. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> further
                        stated that, while thought of coup d’état had been in his mind, he had not
                        intended act so precipitously. He explained, however, that all senior
                        officers in attendance at his Nov 24 meeting had unanimously insisted that
                        the army intervene in order insure governmental mechanism was put to work
                        once again. Col. Ferdinand Malili, <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>
                        Chief of Staff, in separate conversation with <persName corresp="#p_DLA_1">Devlin</persName>, confirmed decision had been unanimous and none of
                        the officers would hear of delay in implementing coup.</p>
                    <p>C. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> said that, while he will
                        endeavor maintain good relations with all African States, his regime will
                        insure that Communist influence is not felt in Congo.</p>
                    <p>D. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> wants create govt of senior
                        party and regional officials all of whom must be extremely competent in
                        their given ministries. Said he had been in telephone communications with
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, who, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> alleges, supports his action.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> said he has not yet
                        decided identity of persons to be included in new govt but indicated he
                        might well name <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> as Min Econ
                        Affairs and possibly Vice Premier. He also stated he is considering
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> FonMin. He noted that
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> has better understanding

                        Congolese with possible exception of <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>. He also implied he might ask <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> serve as roving ambassador to other
                        African States. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> plans retain
                        Defense Ministry and said he would ask Gen. Delperdange remain as his Chief
                        Advisor Military Affairs in ministry. He also strongly implied that although
                        Gen. Bobozo will serve as Chief of Army, he (<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>) intends retain personal control of army.</p>
                    <p>E. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> repeatedly stressed he is
                        counting on American friendship and support and commented that if his govt
                        fails, it will result in complete chaos in Congo, a situation which, he
                        thought, would almost certainly spread to neighboring countries. Although
                        time did not permit <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> to be
                        more specific, if indeed he does know exactly what he wants at this time he
                        said he is counting on American support in providing food and advice as to
                        how resolve critical economic and financial situation faced by <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>. Elaborating on this thought, he
                        referred to food shortages in certain areas which must be eliminated to
                        forestall further serious price increases. Said what he needs most at this
                        moment is top-notch economic advice.</p>
                    <p>F. When <persName corresp="#p_DLA_1">Devlin</persName> took his leave,
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> urged him cable

                    <p>G. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> believes he has support of
                        Presidents of House and Senate. Said both officials have promised try to
                        organize parliament in order obtain parliamentary approval for coup. They
                        told him they would schedule such meetings of both houses of parliament for
                        1500 local Nov 25. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> added he
                        had told presidents of chambre and Senate he hopes create stable regime with
                        continuity and added for example that if things worked out he would expect
                        presidents of both houses remain in office at least five years.</p>
                    <p>H. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> said that while <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> is free <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> does not expect him leave his
                        residence. When <persName corresp="#p_DLA_1">Devlin</persName> asked what
                        would happen if <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> were to
                        move to Bas Congo area, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                        merely shrugged and repeated that he did not expect <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> leave <gloss target="#t_Leo_1">Leo</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>2. Atmospherics: <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> appeared
                        relaxed despite fact that he said he had not slept for approximately 36
                        hours. He was surrounded by all his senior officers most of whom seemed
                        tired but satisfied with developments. One exception appeared to be Col.
                        Yamasaki, <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>’s military aide.
                        Latter had a rather long face and looked even worse than he usually did.</p>

                        ref, [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] stated following:</p>
                    <p>A. He sincerely apologized for not having warned [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] in advance on his plans. Asked that this apology be
                        transmitted to [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] explained his
                        failure advise Station in advance by saying he would have called if [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] phone had been installed. [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] just completed move to new quarters. As
                        [Embassy] unable arrange for phone, [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] sent his commo chief to phone company morning 24 Nov
                        with order that phone be installed soonest. Unfortunately phone not

                    <p>B. In addition to requesting food and an economic advisor, [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] said he would appreciate receiving
                        all advisors that <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss> can provide. He
                        specifically cited need for advisor to guide information ministry, a
                        political advisor to provide him with guidance and additional assistance for
                            [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>]. When he commented

                        called in new chief of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not

                        senior [Congolese Army] officers and stated he wanted have personal talk. He
                        stressed he looking to <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss> for advice
                        and guidance now and in future. He added even though he recognizes that he
                        will be dealing with [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>]
                        regularly once <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> recognition
                        obtained, he wants to maintain close working relationship with Station. He
                        instructed his secretary prepare permanent pass for [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] which will permit him enter any
                        [Congolese Army] installation any time.</p>
                    <p>D. [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] repeatedly stressed he
                        needs help and that without <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss>
                        support his efforts will fail.</p>
                    <p>2. Although recognize that <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> must
                        wait for discreet period before extending recognition and that <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> would prefer have some African
                        countries take lead, Leop sincerely hopes <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> will recognize that, if [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] fails in his effort bring order out of chaos, all
                            <pb n="662" facs="0695" xml:id="pg_662"/>efforts to date will be wasted
                        and Congo will almost certainly slip down drain into chaos. Leop cannot

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s actions raised internal

                        reducing presidential age requirement from 40 to accommodate 35-year old

                        for five years; 3) enabling increase in number of ministers from present 19

                        that country tired of instability;</p>
                    <p>2. However politicians out of power cannot be expected in long run accept
                        system which denies them fruits of power. Over period of time opposition to
                        present regime will probably build, possibly making <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, unless he able to strike balance
                        and adjustment with most political groups, revert to increasing repressive
                        measures;</p>
                    <p>3. Therefore it seems important that regime make good start, within
                        limitations its present resources, to resolve outstanding problems or begin
                        to do so;</p>
                    <p>4. <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> appears to have unparalleled
                        opportunity with maximum Congolese cooperation to make constructive
                        contribution to resolution security, administrative, economic and financial
                        problems;</p>
                    <p>5. US hopes therefore that <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> can show
                        maximum flexibility in meeting needs for technical, economic and military
                        assistance to present government. In many ways military assistance in terms
                        increased number military advisors, which apparently desired by <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, is easiest method of assistance.
                        Although we believe ceiling on <pb n="667" facs="0700" xml:id="pg_667"/>numbers Belgian military personnel should be raised we suggest this should
                        be gradual process. Too rapid build-up would not only give Belgium bad image
                        Congo and elsewhere but in long run also make <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> vulnerable to domestic and international criticism.
                        More fundamental method help Congo probably lies in field technical
                        assistance especially strengthening administrative teams. Finally balance of
                        payments assistance (including but not restricted to proposed $20 million
                        credit) is needed to fill FX gap and contribute to stability we seek for
                        Congo. Latter, we realize, is predicated on more effective performance by
                            <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> in putting financial house into
                        better order;</p>
                    <p>6. In summary we believe <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> should seize
                        opportunity offered it to be forthcoming toward reasonable, realistic, well
                        documented requests for assistance. At same time it would be best avoid
                        precipitous action which could be interpreted as Belgian re-colonization or
                            neocolonialism.<note n="4" xml:id="d458fn4">In telegram 655 from

                    <p>1. Although the Leopoldville Station continued to work on many fronts,
                        particularly in support of paramilitary operations, it concentrated on the
                        political crisis which became more critical during the <pb n="668" facs="0701" xml:id="pg_668"/>months of October and November. The Station
                        preached moderation to its numerous political contacts but it proved
                        impossible to control the game. As noted in [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                            line not declassified</hi>]<note n="2" xml:id="d459fn2">Not
                            found.</note> from this Station, <gloss target="#t_ODACID_1">ODACID</gloss>’s decision not to permit Leopoldville to engage in
                        political action greatly handicapped the Station in its efforts to support
                            <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> objectives.</p>
                    <p>2. The coup d’etat of 25 November 1965 resolved, at least temporarily, the
                        political crisis which had resulted in a complete breakdown in governmental
                        functions and which, had it continued, would almost certainly have led to
                        even greater chaos. We believe the successful coup d’etat represents the
                        best possible solution to a problem which placed <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss>’s objectives in Africa in serious jeopardy. The
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> regime represents the
                        best government which <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> might
                        expect to obtain. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> is moderate
                        and pro-West in his outlook; our relationship with him is good and he is
                        generally willing to accept advice. On the debit side, however, the Station,
                        the Embassy and most knowledgeable Belgian and Congolese observers here are
                        of the opinion that the <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                        government represents the last hope for the West in the Congo (and possibly
                        throughout Black Africa). There is little chance that, should his regime
                        fail, it will be replaced by a regime acceptable to the West. Should he
                        fail, we believe it more than probable that the Congo would split into a
                        number of small client states, some of which would fall under Bloc
                        influence. Few, if any, of these states would be economically viable and
                        many would be in conflict, one with the other. Thus, Leopoldville believes
                        that all <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> agencies should do
                        everything possible to ensure the success of the <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> regime. The Station has already
                        made a number of recommendations, particularly as concerns the provision of
                        advisors, and further recommendations will be forthcoming.</p>
                    <p>3. In summation the Station believes that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s coup d’etat represented the only feasible solution
                        to the political crisis. It provides <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> with time to try, in cooperation with the Congolese
                        Government, to find solutions to the nearly insoluble Congo problem. The
                        Station does not believe that the solutions will be facile. <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss> must be prepared to take the
                        initiative and to engage in a major effort which, if it fails, would almost
                        certainly result in defeat of <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss>
                        objectives in the Congo and, probably, in most of Black Africa. However, the
                        final outcome will not depend upon <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss> alone. If other <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> agencies fail to take decisive action or if the
                        Congolese themselves are unable or unwilling to take the necessary steps, a
                        new and even more serious crisis will develop. In view of the foregoing, the
                        Leopoldville Station is devoting considerable time and energy to [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not <pb n="669" facs="0702" xml:id="pg_669"/>declassified</hi>] operations designed to provide
                        early warning, should the opposition try to launch another coup d’etat.
                        These operations also are designed to provide <gloss target="#t_ODYOKE_1">ODYOKE</gloss> with operational intelligence. In addition, the Station
                        is emphasizing its [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>]
                        operations in an effort to shore up and assist the present government.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The launching of a military campaign last September against the large rebel
                        concentration in the Fizi area was expected to end the last major rebel
                        threat to the country as a whole. Still in progress, the campaign has been
                        successful in recapturing key towns and dispersing rebel forces.
                        Nevertheless, recent reports from the Congo indicate significant rebel
                        activity in the region around Albertville, the Northeast sector, and the
                        Stanleyville area. Locations of rebel strength and activity are marked on
                        the attached map<note n="2" xml:id="d460fn2">Not reproduced.</note> and
                        described in some detail below.</p>
                    <p>In the Northeast sector alone, the number of rebels has been reported to be
                        as high as 17,500, grouped in about ten locations. Further west, the cities
                        of Ango and Bondo are still in rebel hands. To the south, the area between
                        Buta and Banalia is infested with rebels and has recently been the scene of
                        sharp battles. During the period December 12–18 in this area, the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> killed 23 rebels and took 84 prisoners.
                        The <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> suffered at least seven dead and 18
                        wounded. Rebel discipline and determination in this area and the
                        Stanleyville region are reported to be increasing. The <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> lost seven men in recent fighting within
                        15 <pb n="670" facs="0703" xml:id="pg_670"/>miles of Stanleyville, and rebel
                        bands continue to infiltrate into the suburbs of the city.</p>
                    <p>The area where rebels have been most active is located to the west of
                        Albertville. In contrast to other areas where the rebels usually confine
                        themselves to defensive action and ambushing patrols, rebel groups in the
                        Albertville area have been attacking <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>
                        positions and displaying a high degree of sophistication, most notably in
                        the destruction of two solid bridges and use of mines to sabotage railway
                        lines. An <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> communiqué reported that 150
                        rebels were killed in a pitched battle on December 2 just 25 miles south of
                        Bukavu on the Rwandan border.</p>
                    <p>Rebels in all areas usually do not possess enough weapons to arm every man,
                        but they have been effectively using automatic rifles, mortars, and mines in
                        addition to the traditional “poo-poo” guns. Although <persName corresp="#p_GCH_1">Gbenye</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SGE_1">Soumialot</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ONI_1">Olenga</persName>
                        are generally discredited, rebel field leadership seems to be improving, as
                        evidenced by increased discipline, sophisticated tactics, and improved
                        morale. Foreign advisory assistance is probably a factor, but none of the
                        Cubans alleged to accompany rebel forces in the East has been captured.
                        Support from neighboring countries has diminished considerably over the past
                        several months, but there are still unconfirmed reports of rebel movements
                        in Tanzania and large groups of armed rebels in the southern Sudan. In
                        addition to Rwandan Tutsis, some Burundi nationals have been involved in the
                        fighting in the Bukavu–Fizi region.</p>
                    <p>The ability of the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> to defeat or even
                        contain the rebels will depend, as always, upon outside leadership. There
                        are currently some 750 mercenaries in the Congo. Many of these are
                        ineffective, and approximately 100 contracts will expire before March 15.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> has suggested that
                        we consult with the Belgians and perhaps the British on ways of finding
                        replacements for departing mercenaries.</p>

                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Joseph Mobutu</persName>’s assumption of
                        power on November 25 stemmed from the increasingly dangerous confrontation
                        between President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> following the
                        latter’s dismissal, October 13, by <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>
                        named Evariste <persName corresp="#p_KEV_1">Kimba</persName> as Prime
                        Minister-Designate but the latter was defeated in the Congolese Parliament
                        owing to the opposition of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        and his substantial following. <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName>’s reappointment of <persName corresp="#p_KEV_1">Kimba</persName>, coupled with the efforts of members of <persName corresp="#p_KEV_1">Kimba</persName>’s government to discredit <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and his followers, rapidly led to
                        political tension and mounting crisis. General <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, considering the situation dangerous for the country,
                        decided, with his senior officers, to seize power and depose both the
                        President and the government-designate. He named Colonel, now General,
                            <persName corresp="#p_MGL_1">Mulamba</persName> as Prime Minister,
                        suspended certain provisions of the Constitution, and declared that his
                        government and the national Parliament would sit in for five years.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> instituted government by
                        decree with the tacit approval of Parliament. His declared program is to
                        substitute hard work and unity of purpose in the reconstruction of the
                        rebellion-devastated country and the rehabilitation of its economy in place
                        of political maneuvering, corruption and lack of direction. While obviously
                        sincere, it is too early to discern where <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> will draw the line between corruption and the
                        “normal” use of payments and patronage to facilitate governmental
                        operations. His declarations on behalf of better government and improved
                        popular morale have been ringing, and have been accepted thus far with
                        little visible opposition. Many persons are still grateful that his seizure
                        of power resolved a dangerous situation which appeared to threaten the
                        Congo’s existence. The accent is presently on hard work and determination
                        rather than unrest and uncertainty. Rebel activity, while far from dead, has
                        declined.</p>
                    <p>The principal conclusion is that, in fairness to the new regime, it is too
                        early to predict its success or failure. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s motivation appears <pb n="672" facs="0705" xml:id="pg_672"/>quite different from that of the run of Congolese
                        politicians of the last five years. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s political sense should, hopefully, lead him to pull
                        back from the pitfalls inherent in certain ill-advised decrees aimed at
                        conserving foreign exchange, slashing government expenditures, and sending
                        urban employment back home to assist in his agricultural improvement
                        program. Nevertheless, the following are possible trends:</p>
                    <p>1. The General’s army-led regime could lead to the exclusion of civilian
                        leaders and the withering away of opposition parties;</p>
                    <p>2. Resistance to the Government could grow among civil servants whose
                        perquisites and power have been reduced, as well as among the population
                        wearying of measures involving austerity, hard work and discipline;</p>
                    <p>3. The major role assigned to the military could lead to factionalism and
                        competition for political power both among senior officers close to the seat
                        of power and among middle grade officers tasting political power for the
                        first time;</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s over-reliance on Belgian
                        advisors, primarily military, could lead to charges of the regime’s
                        manipulation by foreign, European interests, despite present trends in the
                        regime toward an accentuation of Congolese nationalism;</p>
                    <p>5. The political leaders, especially Moise <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> who is apparently the principal opponent of the
                        regime, may become active against <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, leading to an open contest for power involving the
                        General’s supporters and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s
                        broad parliamentary and popular following or a political coalition of
                        varying groups seeking power.</p>

                        activities in the Congo be maintained at their present level through 30 June

                        participation would be sharply reduced. The reduction may be possible
                        earlier (and would then be greater) if even before that date the Congolese
                        Government accepts responsibility for crewing the boats. The expected level
                        of expenditure for CY 1966 is [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not

                    <p>The objective of these programs, at an estimated total cost for CY 1966 of
                            [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>], is to
                        strengthen the pro-Western regime of General <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Joseph Mobutu</persName> and to provide further needed support to the
                        Congolese Government in its efforts to stamp out the rebellion and restore
                        order in its aftermath.</p>
                    <p>The air program will be reviewed quarterly (the next review to take place in
                        May 1966), with the intent of reducing its level wherever feasible,
                        consistent with U.S. interests at the time. At present, no feasible
                        alternative to its continuation is seen. Following the Belgian Government’s
                        refusal to fund the tactical air program in the Congo, reiterated at recent
                        U.S.-Belgian talks in Brussels, the U.S. Ambassador to the Congo has
                        expressed his deep concern lest the air operation be phased out
                        precipitously or appreciably reduced in the coming months.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">2.</hi> Problem</p>
                    <p>Despite the continuing defeats suffered by rebel military forces and the
                        disarray of the rebel leadership, the Congolese Government has not been able
                        to reestablish administrative control and consequently the free movement of
                        commerce in much of the area once overrun by the rebels. Rebel bands are
                        still active in the northeastern and eastern Congo and, in the latter area,
                        north of Albertville, still mount successful ambushes and other harrassing
                        actions against Central Government forces. There are large groups of rebels
                        in the southern Sudan, Uganda, Burundi and Tanzania. The governments of the
                        Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda have officially ceased active support of rebel
                        efforts to mount offensive action within the Congo and have taken steps to
                        suppress rebel military activity based on their territories. However, as
                        late as November 1965, a small action was fought at night between boats
                        belonging to the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]
                        maritime unit on Lake Tanganyika and rebel boats approaching the Congo from
                        the Tanzanian shore.</p>
                    <pb n="674" facs="0707" xml:id="pg_674"/>
                    <p>In January 1966, there were reliable reports of Congolese rebel activity
                        based in Uganda and directed against the Congo, and during this same month,
                        the growing radical-Tutsi influence over the Burundi Government has raised
                        the very real possibility of a renewal of significant Chinese Communist
                        influence in Bujumbura, including the reopening of their Embassy which
                        served in 1964 as one of the major sources of aid to rebels operating in the
                        eastern Congo.</p>
                    <p>Of real importance and apart from continuing rebel military activity and the
                        possibility of renewed Chinese Communist or other Bloc support is the
                        failure of the Congolese Government, to date, to take effective action
                        directed at the political, economic and social factors that were the
                        principal causes of the rebellion. On 25 November 1965, fearing that the
                        conflict between then President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and former Premier Moise <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> threatened political chaos and the
                        loss of all the gains recently made against the rebels, Congolese National
                        Army Commander-in-Chief General <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> seized power. He thus provided the Congo with what
                        many informed observers believe to be its last chance to resolve its
                        problems in the framework of a unified nation under a pro-Western
                        government.</p>

                    <p>The [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] maritime, air
                        and covert political funding operations in the Congo have been carried out
                        at the request of the Department of State and the Ambassador and with the
                        approval of the 303 Committee. The Ambassador at Leopoldville and the Bureau
                        of African Affairs of the Department of State have recommended a
                        continuation of these operations at the levels indicated in the initial
                        paragraph above.</p>
                    <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Relationship to Previous 303 Committee Actions</hi></p>
                    <p>On 23 September 1965, the 303 Committee approved a proposal, presented in a
                        status report on the Lake Tanganyika maritime interdiction program, dated 21
                        September 1965, to add two armed, radar-equipped, 50-foot high-speed boats
                        (Swifts) and up to five smaller boats (Seacrafts) to the existing limited
                        maritime capability at Albertville. The Committee also approved the initial
                        manning of these boats by [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] crews, with the understanding that the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] would be replaced
                        by other third-country nationals as soon as qualified personnel became
                        available.</p>
                    <p>On 28 October 1965, the Committee approved the continuation of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] covert tactical
                        support for the Congolese Air Force at an annual level of [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>], but requested quarterly reviews
                        and a sustained effort to modify and cut back whenever possible.</p>
                    <pb n="675" facs="0708" xml:id="pg_675"/>
                    <p>On 26 November 1965, the Committee approved a request for [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] to meet existing and potential
                        appeals for funds by General <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>.</p>

                    <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">The maritime program</hi></p>
                    <p>The maritime program now consists of the two Swifts (which have been in
                        operation on Lake Tanganyika since the first week of November), six
                        Seacraft, and the <hi rend="italic">Ermens</hi>, a 75-foot diesel-powered
                        trawler requisitioned locally by the Congolese authorities. As crews for the
                        Swifts there are 15 [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>].</p>
                    <p>The boats have been used extensively in interdiction patrols to prevent
                        supplies and men from reaching rebels fighting on the eastern shore of Lake
                        Tanganyika and to prevent rebels from escaping across the lake to Tanzania.
                        Although direct contact with the enemy on the lake has not been frequent, it
                        is known that two Soviet-supplied 35-foot armed launches have been on the
                        lake since September 1965. As a result of the Congolese maritime force, most
                        of the traffic between Tanzania and the rebels has had to move by night. In
                        November 1965, the Congolese force engaged five rebel craft after dark,
                        apparently proceeding from Tanzania to the Congo. Throughout the current
                        military campaign against the last centers of organized rebel resistence in
                        the eastern Congo, the boats have carried out reconnaissance patrols;
                        escorted other boats transporting personnel, supplies of food, ammunition
                        and arms; and evacuated wounded. The presence of the boats on the lake has
                        continued to have a salutary effect on the morale of the local population,
                        both African and European.</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] continuing efforts
                        to find suitable replacements for the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                            not declassified</hi>] crews of the Swifts, it is expected that several

                        over the manning of the boats to Congolese troops and mercenaries. At the
                        time of writing, discussions on this subject have begun. If they are
                        successful, it appears likely that Congolese and mercenaries will in the
                        near future assume most of the duties now carried out by [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]. This would make possible a
                        further reduction in the cost of the maritime program, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] to supply operational direction
                        for the boats and the necessary spare parts and specialized maintenance.</p>
                    <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">The air program</hi></p>
                    <p>The air operation now maintains aircraft at the following level: twelve
                        T–28’s, five B–26K’s, one B–26B, three C–46’s, one C–45 (10–2) and three
                            <persName corresp="#p_BDE_1">Bell</persName> helicopters. The third C–46
                        was acquired in October 1965 because of the increased transport burden borne
                        by the air operation <pb n="676" facs="0709" xml:id="pg_676"/>since the
                        withdrawal in mid-August of the Joint Task Force C–130’s formerly stationed
                        in Leopoldville. Efforts to have the Belgian-piloted C–47’s of the Congolese
                        Air Force provide the necessary support were unsuccessful. Flying the
                        aircraft are 29 pilots [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>] who
                        operate under the supervision of six American air operations officers. There
                        are also 130 ground maintenance personnel, 127 of whom are Europeans; the
                        other three, Americans.</p>
                    <p>The [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] air operation
                        has made a significant contribution in the campaign in the eastern Congo
                        north of Albertville. The campaign opened on the night of 27–28 September
                        1965 with an attack on the rebel stronghold of Baraka and continues in the
                        form of cleanup operations requiring close air support for the ground
                        forces. The other primary area of air activity is in the northeast out of
                        Stanleyville. In general, neither Congolese nor mercenary troops are willing
                        to move without air cover.</p>
                    <p>The slowly improving military situation is permitting a reduction in the pace
                        of tactical air activity. Thus, it is planned to withdraw the B–26B from
                        service. It is also planned to reduce further the use of tactical aircraft
                        and eventually eliminate more planes in this category, by providing light
                        aircraft which are less costly to operate and maintain, more efficient for
                        reconnaissance work (which until now has had to be carried out by tactical
                        aircraft), and less visibly U.S. military aircraft.</p>
                    <p>The above reduction in pace and change in character of air activities as well
                        as planned changes in logistical procedures have permitted an initial
                        lowering of the annual cost level from [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line

                    <p>The gradual replacement of the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] pilots by other third-country nationals is a
                        continuing effort.</p>

                        1965 to meet the continuing political crisis in the Congo, [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] has been expended in
                        payments to General <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, the last

                        been authorized in January 1966, leaving a balance of [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] on hand. This money has been spent
                        to ensure the support of the principal officers of the Congolese National
                        Army and particularly of the First Paracommando Battalion, which is the key
                        to the security of Leopoldville; to provide funds to important political
                        leaders; and to furnish assistance to provincial leaders and tribal chiefs
                        when they visit Leopoldville. It is the belief of the Ambassador at
                        Leopoldville and the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> Chief of Station
                        that the provision of these funds was an important element in ensuring the
                        support of ranking Congolese officers and their commands during the crisis
                        brought on by the conflict between former <pb n="677" facs="0710" xml:id="pg_677"/>President <persName corresp="#p_KEJ_1">Kasavubu</persName> and former Premier Moise <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, a crisis which ended when General

                        Leopoldville on 25 November 1965. The timely provision of these funds when
                        they were most needed greatly assisted <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> in his effort to reestablish a functioning
                        government. He has stated that without them he would have been unable to
                        consolidate his position.</p>

                            Considerations</hi></p>
                    <p>Since the outbreak of the Congo rebellion in 1964, it has been U.S. policy to
                        support the pro-West Central Government against the rebels, who have
                        received aid and encouragement from Communist China, Cuba, the radical
                        African states and the Soviet Union. African and Soviet assistance to the
                        rebels greatly diminished during the latter part of 1965. Also, it seems
                        probable that by now most if not all the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                            not declassified</hi>] formerly with the rebels have left the Congo.
                        Nevertheless, pockets of rebel resistance still remain on Congolese
                        territory, rebel groundfire still hits Congolese Air Force planes, shorefire
                        is drawn by Congolese patrol boats on Lake Tanganyika, rebel mines are laid
                        with more proficiency in the path of advancing Congolese troops, and recent
                        reports indicate that rebel leaders maintain continuing contact with
                        Chinese, Soviet, and [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] in East Africa. Thus, it is logical to assume that
                        Communist China, the Soviet Union, Cuba and possibly other Bloc powers would
                        take advantage of any weakness of the Congolese Government to encourage a

                        Congo are (a) to assist the Congolese Government in maintaining a maritime
                        patrol capability designed to discourage further assistance reaching the
                        rebels from the outside and to contribute to stability in the eastern Congo,
                        (b) to give the Congolese Air Force an adequate capability to support the
                        Congolese National Army in its efforts to locate and eliminate rebel
                        resistance and to restore and maintain order in the countryside, and (c) to
                        assist General <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> in his effort
                        to keep the support of the army and of key political leaders and

                    <p>Although visible U.S. involvement has been kept to a minimum, it is generally
                        assumed in the Congo that the U.S. Government is responsible for the air and
                        maritime operations. They thus continue to be potentially embarrassing for
                        the U.S. Government. However, the potential for embarrassment has been
                        markedly reduced by the fact that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> is no longer Prime Minister and the Congolese
                        Government is thus no longer a primary target of hostility from other

                    <p>f. <hi rend="italic">Alternative Courses of Action</hi></p>
                    <p>The U.S. Government failed in its efforts during talks held in Brussels in
                        September 1965 and early February 1966 to persuade the Belgian Government to
                        assume responsibility for the tactical air support program or even for
                        logistical support of the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] air operation.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has no political organization
                        which, as an alternative to the U.S. covert funding program, can provide him
                        with the funds needed to ensure his continuation in office. Nor is there any
                        wealthy managerial or commercial class to whom he can turn to finance his
                        political efforts. If the U.S. Government refuses to help him, he has the
                        alternative of seeking help from other Western states. To date, other
                        Western powers have been unwilling to provide political action funds in
                        sufficient quantity. Another alternative would be for him to try to squeeze
                        such funds from the local European business and commercial community by a
                        form of blackmail or resort to graft. Such devices might easily backfire,
                        particularly if attempted before <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> is firmly in power. A third alternative would be for
                        him to turn to the French, Soviets, Chinese Communists or radical Africans.
                        While he probably would not accept direct Soviet or Chinese Communist funds,
                        he might in desperation accept funds from the radical African states or the
                        French. <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> has no evidence that the French
                        Government would be prepared to accept the financial burden involved. If the
                        radical African states did so, the ultimate source of the funds they
                        provided would almost certainly be one of the Bloc powers.</p>

                    <p>With your O.K., I had a deal with <persName corresp="#p_HRI_1">Helms</persName> to review the whole program by March and see what
                        economies possible. They cut a whole half million off the air
                        bill—peanuts.</p>
                    <p>The air force ([<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>]) is
                        the nub. I’d give ’em half this ([<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                            declassified</hi>]) for use through 30 June and tell <pb n="680" facs="0713" xml:id="pg_680"/>them to cut back to no more than [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] for the second half
                        year. Believe me, my horseback guess is just as good as theirs.</p>

                    <p>a. On the request for approval to continue [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not
                            declassified</hi>] maritime, air and covert funding operations in the

                        represented compliance with the committee’s expressed wish that a
                        substantial reduction be made. The new request represented only a half
                        million dollar slash from the earlier high rate of expenditure [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>].</p>
                    <p>b. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FGD_1">Glenn Fields</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DLA_1">Lawrence Devlin</persName>, <gloss target="#t_CAS_1">CAS</gloss> Chief in Leopoldville, took pains to point out that a
                        reduction would result in a sizable cutback of missions, fewer aircraft
                        spare parts, and no resupply after attrition. They further felt that the
                        rebels, though somewhat more somnolent in their recent behaviour, had still
                        not been eradicated, that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s
                        ground troops just won’t move without air support, and that any withdrawal
                        of support at this time would seriously jeopardize <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s fragile resolve. They emphasized
                        that they would be glad to off-load this heavy paramilitary burden but there
                        were absolutely no <pb n="681" facs="0714" xml:id="pg_681"/>takers. They
                        warned of a possible collapse of central government authority and a rapid
                        Balkanization of the country with the only profiteers being neighbouring
                        countries and communist opportunism and adventures.</p>
                    <p>c. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG_1">Bundy</persName> responded that higher
                        authority took a most negative attitude toward open-end drains on <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> funding without hard-nosed efforts to make
                        recipients tighten their own belts. He stated the 303 Committee had decided
                        earlier to reduce, and this proposal seemed to be taking the line of least
                        resistance via perennial handout. The committee agreed that for the next 60
                        days funds could be expended in proportionate allotments from existing
                        budget levels, but in March a plan should be presented—the air portion was
                        emphasized—with a substantial slash from the proposed [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] million to no higher than [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] with the full
                        intention of slashing the latter figure in half again for the last part of
                        the year.</p>
                    <p>d. The issue was decided less on analysis of the murky Congo situation and
                        more on the basis that the proposal did not follow earlier 303 directives,
                        the language of which was as follows: “The committee asked for quarterly
                        reviews and a consistent effort to modify and cut back wherever possible.”

                    <p>944.1. Conjunction of discouraging <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> view
                        and Lelyfeld article raises question of outlook for Congo and <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> government over next few
                        months.</p>
                    <p>2. Impression which emerges is that of rudderless administration furnishing
                        even less guidance and authority than heretofore and lack of <pb n="682" facs="0715" xml:id="pg_682"/>coherent and unified government direction.
                        There seems to be little question that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> well-intentioned and sincere but unable cope with
                        problems or even decide where to start. On financial side <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> indicates utter despair over Litho and his
                        deleterious influence and actions. Mission saw little likelihood that <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> willing and able take necessary action
                        put its house in order.</p>
                    <p>3. In conversation with <gloss target="#t_Deptoff_1">Deptoff</gloss> French
                        counselor Dubois, presumably reflecting general GOF opinion, gave his
                        impression that things going from bad to worse and that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> could not continue present
                        ineffectiveness and remain in power. He wondered about undesirable or at
                        least unhelpful role of Belgian military advisers in non-military field.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s ineptness in public
                        relations as evidenced in visits to Bukavu and Elisabethville also
                        discouraging. <persName corresp="#p_MGL_1">Mulamba</persName>’s sharp,
                        possibly justified reaction to attitudes toward Congo and Congolese shown by
                        Belgian—and presumably other foreign—individuals adds another dimension to
                        apparent malaise.</p>
                    <p>5. We realize magnitude of seemingly perennial Congo problem often leads, on
                        part of some observers, to feeling of hopelessness which not necessarily
                        justified. However on the basis information available we too have impression
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> government seems to have
                        lost its headway and is operating from day to day avoiding the hard
                        decisions and actions required of it.</p>
                    <p>6. Therefore would appreciate as soon as possible Embassy assessment of: (1)
                        effectiveness present government; (2) prospects for economic stabilization;
                        (3) overall efficiency provincial administration; (4) longevity <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_MGL_1">Mulamba</persName> government; (5) cohesiveness of senior army

                    <p>1. It is requested that Project [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not
                            declassified</hi>] be formally terminated effective 30 June 1965 [<hi rend="italic">1966</hi>?].</p>
                    <p>2. The primary objective of Project [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not
                            declassified</hi>], from 1 July 1962 to termination, was to promote
                        political stability in the Congo by strengthening moderate political
                        elements. This objective was pursued through funding of key assets who could
                        provide a political action capability at the national level.</p>
                    <p>3. This request for termination is, in a sense, a product of Project [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] success. <gloss target="#t_ODACID_1">ODACID</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss> believe it is no longer necessary to engage in the
                        large-scale political funding authorized by Project [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>]. The objectives of promoting stability
                        and moderation remain the same, but the means needed to pursue these
                        objectives are now different.</p>
                    <p>4. All commitments and quit claims have been settled.</p>
                    <p>5. [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] was approved for
                        Project [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] for <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1965. [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                            declassified</hi>] was actually spent. [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount
                            not declassified</hi>] was turned back to Africa Division funds. There
                        are no residual assets, funds or personnel to be disposed of as a result of
                        this project termination. <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss>
                        continues to have an operational relationship with selected assets
                        previously funded under Project [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not
                            declassified</hi>]. The purpose of such association is now primarily for
                        collection of foreign intelligence information and to maintain an equity for
                        the future; not for political action.</p>
                    <p>6. There is no risk to <gloss target="#t_KUBARK_1">KUBARK</gloss> or other

                    <p>a. On the question of continued air support to the Congo (see minutes dated
                        21 February 1966, Item 1),<note n="2" xml:id="d467fn2">See <ref target="#d464">Document 464</ref>. On March 21, <persName corresp="#p_HRI_1">Helms</persName> approved release of a memorandum
                            to the 303 Committee requesting a reconsideration of the decision to
                            reduce the air program in the Congo. (Central Intelligence Agency Files,
                            Job 81–00966R, Box 1, Folder 12, Congo 1966)</note> Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> kept probing for some method to
                        reduce the seemingly endless assistance, some way in which to shift the
                        burden to the Congolese so that they could do more to help themselves.</p>
                    <p>b. Mr. FitzGerald reviewed the problem and emphasized that the Ambassador,
                        the Air Attaché, the <gloss target="#t_CINCSTRIKE_1">CINCSTRIKE</gloss>
                        representative, and the Chief of Station were unanimous that, without air
                        support, the Congolese effort against the rebels would evaporate.</p>
                    <p>c. He pointed out that although the revolt was not one in which a mobile
                        rebel army was on the rampage seizing cities, the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>, nevertheless, <pb n="685" facs="0718" xml:id="pg_685"/>
                        was not eliminating the rebels and revitalizing the northeast. They were
                        holding the rebels in pockets, but neither mercenaries nor the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> would budge without the modest umbrella of
                        a dozen or so T–28’s and a handful of B–26K’s. He pointed out that some
                        economies could be effectuated with the withdrawal of the longer range
                        B–28K’s, which were more expensive to maintain, and some economies might be
                        made by cutting the number of sorties. However, he warned that the outlook
                        for even a minimal Congolese air force was at best lugubrious. The Belgians
                        were convinced you couldn’t make the Congolese into pilots, period; the
                        Italians thought they could but were far from proving it with their own
                        flabby program. If we pulled out, it was emphasized, the Congolese just
                        didn’t have the means to achieve results on their own.</p>
                    <p>d. It became apparent that the current expense was not the main problem but
                        rather the Congolese themselves; [<hi rend="italic">1 line not

                    <p>e. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> wondered about
                        the embarrassment potential, for example in Rhodesia, stemming from the
                        present state of affairs. Mr. FitzGerald pointed out that under present
                        circumstances the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> was in a position of
                        control over these assets.</p>
                    <p>f. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> stated that, in his
                        opinion, the military requirements must continue to be met. He therefore
                        suggested a prompt survey by the <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> on
                        what the minimum military requirements should be. The committee agreed to
                        this. The committee will examine these findings when ready and review the
                        problem late in April.<note n="3" xml:id="d467fn3">At the 303 Committee
                            meeting on April 22, <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> was
                            asked if the <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> had come up with a
                            definitive opinion on necessary air support to the Congo. He replied
                            that they had not and were not able to assess the need largely because
                            the size and status of the rebel threat was thoroughly opaque. It was
                            suggested that two <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> officers in
                            civilian dress, perhaps accompanied by a <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> Headquarters officer, proceed to the field and

                        current accusations against him. Puati indicated <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> concerned and seeking friendly government’s advice re

                    <p>2. <gloss target="#t_Deptoff_1">Deptoff</gloss> replied by reviewing <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> attitude toward <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> when he President of Katanga and

                        as toward other ex-premiers. Department had no information bearing on
                        reliability reports <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s
                        activities since arrival Europe.</p>
                    <p>3. Puati then asked what <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> attitude would
                        be if it develops <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> conspiring
                        against <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>. <gloss target="#t_Deptoff_1">Deptoff</gloss> said that our correct and frank
                        relationship with <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and others
                        in <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> would continue in accordance our
                        known policy toward Congo. <gloss target="#t_Deptoff_1">Deptoff</gloss> then
                        asked whether Puati believed <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        engaged subversive activities and received reply that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> sufficiently supported by powerful
                        elements in Brussels to assure credibility such suspicion.</p>
                    <p>4. Puati’s manner indicated belief <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> conspiring and fear <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s base may be broad enough to cause considerable
                        trouble to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>. He doubted
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> could now return
                        Leopoldville. Subsequent conversation with Chargé Nzeza revealed latter
                        unaware of <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Nendaka</persName>’s charges against
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, not directly concerned
                        with Puati’s activities and presumably ignorant of latter’s visit to

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Issue:</p>
                    <p>There is currently considerable strain on Belgo-Congolese relations centered
                        in the negotiations in Brussels over the financial settlement between the
                        two countries reached in February 1965. The Congolese delegation led by the
                        Prime Minister and Foreign Minister has made charges of insulting behavior
                        by Belgian officials and presented what the Belgians consider unacceptable
                        proposals for reopening and revising the settlement. This action, preceded
                        as it was by financial measures detrimental to Belgian interests in the
                        Congo, could create a public and government climate unpropitious for the
                        continuation of Belgian assistance to the Congo at present levels.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion:</p>
                    <p>We are inclined to regard President <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MGL_1">Mulamba</persName> and Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> as still basically pre-Belgian and favorable toward
                        continued Belgian assistance to the Congo and the role of Belgian
                        enterprises in the country’s economy. If this is true, the current strain
                        between the two countries can be expected to subside, whether or not present
                        talks on the financial settlement are broken off or pursued to a
                        satisfactory conclusion. Therefore it would be unfortunate if the Belgian
                        Government, acting on the basis of the present atmosphere, were to revise
                        its plans for assistance to the Congo in the economic, technical and
                        military fields.</p>
                    <p>The Belgian Government’s position in the Congo is an extremely influential
                        one. Despite momentary lapses, Belgian military advisers to General
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_MGL_1">Mulamba</persName> are among the most
                        influential in the entourage. Similarly Belgian economic and other advisers
                            <pb n="688" facs="0721" xml:id="pg_688"/> throughout the government play
                        significant parts as counselors and usually have the confidence of their
                        Congolese principals. The Belgians have no reason to expect a change in this
                        situation on the basis of events to date, since in most cases—but not
                        all—they are aware of the necessity of not playing too obvious a role in
                        Congolese internal affairs. Nevertheless the <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> regime is undergoing a spasm of nationalist feeling
                        tinged with xenophobia which expresses itself in outcries against foreign
                        influence, insistence that foreign enterprises must become Congolese
                        entities and emphasis on the “Congolization” of government and business.
                        This campaign is presently carried on mainly at the highest level, although
                        it is beginning to be translated into agitation for the replacement or
                        effacement of Europeans in various areas and positions. Since complete
                        “Congolization”—like nationalization of large industries—has never been a
                        characteristic trend of the Congolese scene, there is no cause to expect
                        that the process will be other than steady and gradual, but recurring
                        difficulties are likely.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPI_1">Harmel</persName> will probably note the
                        recent deterioration in Belgo-Congolese relations and place the blame on the
                        Congolese. He will explain that recent Congolese demands for reopening the
                        financial settlement issue are largely unacceptable and even extreme. He
                        will, however, probably indicate that the Belgian Government is not planning
                        a serious revision of its policy toward assisting the Congo, although
                        Belgian public opinion and certain large mineral exporting corporations in
                        the Congo are experiencing disillusionment as a result of the Brussels
                        negotiations and recent rises in taxes on exports and business operations
                        and increases in the minimum wage levels in the Congo.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation:</p>
                    <p>I recommend that you urge <persName corresp="#p_HPI_1">Harmel</persName> to
                        continue official Belgian assistance policies and aid levels toward the
                        Congo, and carry out actions discussed and agreed to in last February’s
                        U.S.-Belgian bilateral talks, especially the increase in Belgian military
                        instructors and cadres, technical experts and administrative advisory teams
                        in the Congo. The Belgians also agreed to contribute 100 million francs for
                        purchases of military hardware through the Tripartite Logistics Group in
                        Leopoldville with the possibility existing of increasing this amount next
                        year. They also agreed to approach the Italian Government to urge the latter
                        to continue the Italian military pilot training program in the Congo and to
                        seek ways to eliminate frictions which have developed between the Belgian
                        and Italian military missions in Leopoldville. Since the Italian Government
                        is in the final stage of decision-making concerning President <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s request for the Italians to
                        continue their training program, <pb n="689" facs="0722" xml:id="pg_689"/>
                        the Belgians could perhaps indicate at an appropriate high level their
                        strong belief that this training should continue in the Congo.<note n="2" xml:id="d469fn2">No memorandum of conversation recording <persName corresp="#p_HPI_1">Harmel</persName>’s talks with <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> on May 19 has been found.

                    <p>In the early hours of May 30 the Congolese Government exposed a rather
                        childish plot to overthrow the <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> regime. Four former national ministers were arrested
                        through the loyalty to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> of
                        several high-ranking Congolese military officers (notably Colonel Bangala,
                        Governor of Leopoldville) who by pretending to join the conspirators foiled
                        the plot and demonstrated the solidity of <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s position.</p>
                    <p>The arrested conspirators are: (1) Evariste <persName corresp="#p_KEV_1">Kimba</persName> (a <gloss target="#t_BALUBAKAT_1">BALUBAKAT</gloss>

                        proclamation which the conspirators had purportedly drawn up called for the

                        mainly for mishandling of the country’s economic and financial
                        situations.</p>
                    <p>Government statements claimed that four unidentified, non-African Embassies
                        in Leopoldville were approached by the conspirators. We have been told by
                        the Congolese that the Belgian and French Embassies were involved somehow
                        with the conspirators, while our Embassy and the West Germans behaved
                        correctly. A Belgian First Secretary, whose contacts were quite indiscreet,

                    <p>We were approached by Senator Bamba directly late last week [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] in an effort to
                        obtain our support for the coup. Our Chargé warned Bamba against the coup

                        latter said he already knew of it. The Chargé’s prompt action put us in the
                        clear. The Belgians, however, are in a difficult position. The mere
                        existence of the plot has strengthened <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s belief that the Belgians are out to get him. We are
                        doing our best to calm him down and prevent an even further deterioration of

                            Air Operations in the Congo<note n="2" xml:id="d472fn2">Attached but not

                    </list>
                    <p>The principal findings of the Report on Air Operations in the Congo are:</p>
                    <p>(1) Maintenance of air support at present levels to the Congolese military
                        forces is essential for several more years; and</p>
                    <p>(2) A coordinate, multi-national approach to resolution of many Congolese
                        problems is long overdue and could well provide alternatives to the current
                        U.S. level of effort in that country.</p>
                    <p>At least two major arguments are advanced for the development and maintenance
                        of an air capability in the Congo. The first concerns the importance of
                        tactical air support (including air transport) to reduce the effectiveness
                        of rebel or insurgent elements (which, in the main, have been supported by
                        the radical African states and the Chinese Communists). The Report also
                        suggests that tactical air support seems to provide a necessary
                        psychological “prop” to the poorly-trained and poorly-led Congolese Army
                        units. The second major argument concerns the importance of an air transport
                        capability to the extension and maintenance of the Central Government’s
                        control and the continued existence of the Democratic Republic of the Congo
                        as a nation.</p>
                    <p>Much of the Report is an analysis of the fragmented air operations in the
                        Congo which finds the Congolese, but mainly the Belgians, the Italians,
                        mercenaries, [and <gloss target="#t_CAS_1">CAS</gloss>] all sharing

                    <p>Three alternative arrangements for continued Congolese air operations are

                    <p>(2) Transfer control of mercenary pilots, technicians and aircraft to the

                    <p>(3) Integrate as early as possible mercenary pilots, technicians and aircraft
                        and Congolese pilots under the Belgian Air Force Mission (<gloss target="#t_BAFM_1">BAFM</gloss>) with limited U.S. <gloss target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss> support of this effort.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WEG_1">Wheeler</persName> recommends:</p>
                    <p>(a) Support of alternative (1) above, and</p>
                    <p>(b) State initiating—as a matter of priority—high level discussions with
                        Italian, Belgian and Congolese officials to obtain agreement on functions,
                        responsibilities, means, and goals for the development of a satisfactory

                            that “the Agency was not anxious to get into a long-term nursemaid or
                            MAAG type role with the Congolese.” The Executive Secretary noted that
                            the paper established two points quite clearly: first, the Congolese
                            Government definitely needed some air support and second, there was no
                            short cut for <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> to divest itself of
                            this task in the immediate future. (Central Intelligence Agency Files,

                    <p>a. On the question of the Congo, the committee punted again on third down.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> noted that
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>, who had recently
                        been in Washington and had just returned to Leopoldville, was to see
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> shortly on where he was
                        headed with plans for a Congolese Air Force. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> was to point out to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> that the [<hi rend="italic">less
                            than 1 line not declassified</hi>] Air Force was ginned up for an
                        emergency but now the threat from neighbours and rebels had dwindled
                        markedly. There was some need to cut back and become realistic. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> mentioned that via
                        Ambassador Reinhardt we were pressing the Italians to step up their
                        training, but they had their own domestic political problems in agreeing to
                        any long-range aid commitment. The Belgians were pretty well written off as
                        far as concrete assistance at this time.</p>
                    <p>b. It was agreed to await the results of the <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName> talks

                    <p>Joe <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> asked me to come over this
                        afternoon to be briefed on a possible <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> attempt to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>. If it develops, it could be messy—involving all of
                        the worst elements of the Congolese history along with the most disruptive
                        of the Southern African factors. The facts are as follows:</p>
                    <p>1. The <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> has information from a middling
                        reliable source that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> plans a
                        military coup beginning July 21. The 200–250 <hi rend="italic">white</hi>
                        South African and Rhodesian mercenaries are reportedly preparing to move
                        against government troops, starting in Katanga. (This number seems small,
                        but it is sufficient to take over at least the eastern part of the country
                        very quickly.)</p>
                    <p>2. A new contingent of 75 South African mercenaries is scheduled to arrive in
                        Elisabethville on July 21. Normally, such recruits would not be very useful
                        for awhile. But if it is true, as alleged, that South Africa is involved,
                        they may be first-class troops which would make the rebel forces much
                        stronger. Needless to say, all of these mercenaries are well-armed,
                        including the only armored cars in the country.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> is now in Brussels,
                        reportedly putting the final touches on the plot.</p>
                    <p>If the revolt comes off, it will (1) put us back into a Congolese Civil War,
                        without much hope of an effective <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                        intervention, (2) cause great consternation in Zambia, Tanzania, Kenya, and
                        other surrounding countries, (3) aggravate tensions with Rhodesia and South
                        Africa, and (4) create serious pressure for us to move in. Further, if
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> finds out that we know
                        about this plot and have not told him, it will cut our influence
                        substantially.</p>
                    <p>Thus, I agreed with <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName>’s
                        suggestion that we very quietly give <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> the information we have (as we did six weeks ago when
                        he stifled another incipient coup), and advise him to take precautionary
                        steps to head the rebels off. This does not, in my judgment, involve us <pb n="696" facs="0729" xml:id="pg_696"/>too deeply and it protects our
                        interest as much as possible, The cabled instructions will be going out
                        tonight, unless you think otherwise.</p>
                    <p>I also asked <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> to put four or
                        five sentences on this into the Department’s night-reading paper for the
                        President so that he will know the fundamentals.</p>

                        suggest you limit your comments to him to following:</p>
                    <p>(A) We have heard rumors of a plot that may take place within the next few
                        days. These have come from sources of questionable reliability and we wonder
                        what he may know about it.</p>
                    <p>(B) Our information is that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        may be behind the plot and that it may involve both the mercenaries in the
                        country and the new mercenaries from Rhodesia and South Africa who will
                        arrive shortly at Elisabethville airport.</p>
                    <p>(C) It is possible these rumors are being spread simply to create mischief.
                        Would be most harmful his image and our interests if he lashed out widely in
                        all directions and initiated series of reprisals against Congolese or
                        Europeans. We would not wish see repetition June 2 hangings. You should
                        therefore avoid speculating with him on possible involvement certain
                        Congolese within country.</p>
                    <p>In any event you should impress upon <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> that it is essential he react rationally and calmly
                        if he learns any real evidence of a plot. Guidance contained paras 4, 5 and
                        6, <gloss target="#t_Deptel_1">Deptel</gloss> 7084 remains valid.<note n="2" xml:id="d475fn2">Paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 of telegram 7084 to Kinshasa,
                            July 13, listed some possible concrete suggestions for <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> if requested. The Congolese
                            Government should consider preventing the entry of the 75 additional
                            South African mercenaries, seizing control of the craft on Lake
                            Tanganyika, and ensuring the neutralization of the ex-Katanga forces in
                            Kisangani (formerly Stanleyville). <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> should be told that air action involving use of

                    </list>
                    <p>The 303 Committee, at the request of Alexis <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>, held a telephonic vote on Tuesday, 19 July, in
                        favor of contingency air support should a coup be mounted against <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> in the Congo. <hi rend="italic">The
                            principals all voted yea.</hi></p>
                    <p>Nobody was very enthusiastic but felt we had to be ready. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> is preparing a brief memo to the
                        President on this subject.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> made the following reservations on
                        the enclosed sheet.<note n="2" xml:id="d476fn2">Attached but not
                            printed.</note></p>
                    <p>The general feeling is that nothing could be worse than a Belgian-backed and
                        mercenary-reinforced coup by Moise <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> at this time due to the political climate in Black
                        Africa. The British soft line on Rhodesia and the recent unwelcome decision
                        of the World Court have exacerbated sensitive African neighbours’
                        feelings.</p>
                    <p>Although <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> is somewhat inept and
                        his chances of pulling the Congo up by its own bootstraps are indeed remote,
                        the Department and others feel that we have no other choice than to go along
                        with this Congolese for the time being.</p>
                    <p>I call this matter to your attention because of a possible future
                        embarrassment potential should the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>-backed air force ever actually go into action against South
                        African and other white mercenaries. Although unlikely, the strafing and
                        killing of a Major Hoare or so would make a big story and an unfavorable
                        one, depending on the journalist’s slant.</p>

                    <p>17942. Kinshasa 602 (Notal).<note n="2" xml:id="d477fn2">On July 23, the
                            Katanga gendarmes and elements of the mercenary 6th Commandos rebelled
                            in Kisangani and seized parts of the town. In telegram 602 from
                            Kinshasa, July 23, <persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>
                            reported that a deeply distressed <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> told him that he had to get rid of the
                            mercenaries, particularly Belgian nationals, and was thinking of
                            replacing them with African troops who could do garrison but not combat
                            duty. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> asked what the U.S.
                            Government thought of his seeking African troops, what troops did it
                            believe he should use, and if it would contribute toward the cost.
                            (Ibid.)</note></p>
                    <p>1. If <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> does discuss with you
                        idea of requesting African nations supply troops to replace 6th Commandos,
                        you should not respond negatively but should discourage any idea US can
                        finance such arrangements or take on transport of forces involved.</p>
                    <p>2. We do not think here that Tunisians or Ethiopians would respond favorably
                        and we have no intention acting as intermediary for <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> with these governments. Bourguiba
                        seems disenchanted with Sub-Saharan Africa and it is doubtful he would be
                        willing send Tunisian forces to area where problems—from his point of
                        view—are so intractable. Ethiopia likely to be equally negative and refer
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> to <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>. Comments Addis and Tunis would be
                        appreciated.</p>
                    <p>3. We are not prepared undertake financing or support for African units. As
                        you point out, logistic and supply problems would be most difficult.
                        Obligation for airlift forces, which would probably involve continuous use
                        of aircraft for resupply and replacement, is one we cannot assume
                        particularly at time such heavy demands already placed on available
                        resources.</p>
                    <p>4. We have no suggestions where else <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> might turn for African forces. While his relations
                        with East African countries have considerably improved, see no prospect of
                        his obtaining troops from any of them. In general believe we should limit
                        ourselves to discouraging any hope for US assistance and avoid advising re
                        possible African sources of assistance.</p>
                    <p>5. Realize above will put you in somewhat awkward position vis-à-vis
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> but agree with you that
                        it is a little late to seek African troops and possibilities any real
                        assistance from African sources dim.</p>
                    <pb n="699" facs="0732" xml:id="pg_699"/>
                    <p>6. Also foresee problems with Belgians on this subject, especially if final
                        outcome is dismissal Belgian mercenaries and maintenance French. Assume you
                        will inform Bihin if, in fact, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> returns to question.</p>

                    <p>20361. Congo Situation: For Information Only.</p>
                    <p>1. Congo again in grip of political convulsions as <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> regime gravely threatened by mutiny
                        July 23 of Katangan forces in Kisangani.</p>
                    <p>2. Situation complicated by coincidence with reported <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> plot, with connivance some South
                        African and Rhodesian mercenaries, to depose <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> government and reinstall <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> as Prime Minister.</p>
                    <p>3. Existence of separate Katangan units probably loyal to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> has been disturbing to many
                        political foes of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. Mutiny
                        may have been triggered by ill-advised order to disarm them but other
                        factors such as arrears in pay, homesickness for Katanga and discrimination
                        against Katangan units also factors. Although mutineers hold city <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> decided to negotiate with them by
                        sending Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MGL_1">Mulamba</persName> and
                        Katanga governor and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        supporter <persName corresp="#p_MGO_1">Munongo</persName> to Kisangani. No
                        progress has been reported.</p>
                    <p>4. Situation also linked to continuing friction with Belgium characterized by
                            <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> stubbornness in settling economic
                        issues with <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> and private companies,
                        official attacks on Belgium, petty <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>
                        snubbing of <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> negotiators, harassment of
                        Belgian advisers and escalation of already vituperative press warfare
                        between two countries. <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> has also
                        contributed to friction by its occasional lack of responsiveness to
                        Congolese sensibilities.</p>
                    <p>5. Now <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> apparently thinks
                        Belgians may be involved in plot and mutiny. Order for Belgian military
                        assistance personnel in Kisangani <pb n="700" facs="0733" xml:id="pg_700"/>
                        and Bukavu areas to withdraw to groupement headquarters and to refrain from
                        participation in <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> operations apparently
                        reinforces his belief as does neutral position of mercenaries in city, some
                        of which are Belgians. Belgian Consul General in Lubumbashi has been <gloss target="#t_PNG_1">PNG</gloss>’d.</p>
                    <p>6. Following on heels increasing deterioration in Belgo-Congolese relations
                        since May present fracas has disturbing connotations. <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> is awaiting <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> reply to stiff note seeking more moderate Congolese
                        attitude and is prepared threaten suspend all technical assistance if
                        satisfactory reply not forthcoming. Possibility of break in relations cannot
                        be excluded.</p>
                    <p>7. We have followed course of attempting exert moderating influence on
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and remind him that
                            <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> cannot be expected fill any gap
                        left by complete or partial Belgian withdrawal.</p>
                    <p>8. Given nature of Congolese politics it is almost impossible to predict
                        outcome of current crisis. However, despite strong hand he has shown since
                        assuming power and although he may surmount immediate problem, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> is faced with essentially fragile
                        situation net effect of which may weaken his hold.</p>

                            he had been assured by a U.S. representative of the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> that if the Belgians left, the
                            Americans would take their place. (Ibid.)</note></p>
                    <p>1. We believe it entirely possible that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has been peddling line that US would substitute for
                        Belgians in Congo and that Belgian technicians in Congo could well have
                        overheard <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s recent phone
                        calls to <persName corresp="#p_MGL_1">Mulamba</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MGO_1">Munongo</persName>.</p>
                    <pb n="701" facs="0734" xml:id="pg_701"/>
                    <p>2. Further believe there could be several explanations why <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> would peddle this line:</p>
                    <p>a) He entirely aware US position but willing run risk of using this line in
                        effort force Belgians concede <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>
                        demands;</p>
                    <p>b) He may have bloc offers assistance as alternative to Belgians and is using
                        alleged US assurances as smokescreen;</p>
                    <p>c) Despite your several efforts convince him otherwise, he may, either
                        through wishful thinking or failure comprehend firmness US position,
                        continue harbor conviction US will bail him out.</p>
                    <p>3. Whatever possible explanations, Dept considers it vital we make further
                        démarche to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> to make it
                        crystal clear to him that US not willing under any circumstances to
                        substitute in part or in whole for <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>4. Only way we see to scotch this is for you and <persName corresp="#p_DLA_1">Devlin</persName> jointly to see <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>. Without mentioning <persName corresp="#p_DVE_1">Davignon</persName>, you should say you understand story is circulating
                        and apparently gaining credence that U.S. intelligence has said US willing
                        fill Belgian shoes. You should say US cannot fill gaps which departure of
                        Belgians would cause, that you urge him reach acceptable arrangements with
                        Belgians, and that American assistance, even on present scale, would not be
                        effective if Belgians forced leave.</p>
                    <p>5. You should try find opportunity to add that any turn to left and search
                        for bloc assistance would do Congo no good and should not be thought of as
                        valid alternative to policies followed up to now. There ample evidence in
                        Brazzaville and elsewhere that substantial Soviet or other communist
                        assistance inevitably turns sour. Moreover any such development would create
                        entirely new situation in Congo which US would have to take into account in
                        its future relationships with him.</p>
                    <p>6. You should also ensure foregoing views are clearly and currently known to
                        other key members of Government.<note n="3" xml:id="d479fn3">In telegram 970

                        up on job begun by Embassy Kinshasa on Congolese with following objectives
                        in view:</p>
                    <p>(A) Urge Congolese to take as moderate a position as possible, urge them not
                        to insist on res or to content themselves with mild resolution pointing to
                        dangers of situation but without trying to condemn Portugal;<note n="2" xml:id="d480fn2">On September 21, the Congolese Government formally
                            requested a Security Council meeting to consider its charges that the
                            Portuguese Government was harboring in Angola and Cabinda mercenary
                            forces hired by <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> whose
                            mission was to overthrow the legitimate and lawful government of the
                            Congo.</note></p>
                    <p>(B) Make clear to Congo del that, given flimsy nature their case, we unable
                        to assume leadership in Council efforts to negotiate resolution; and
                        unwilling to go along with any except moderate, balanced resolution, and
                        then only in case rest of Council supports it.</p>
                    <p>2. Accordingly we suggest mission contact <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> as soon as possible after his arrival to review our
                        position with him. In addition our position should be explained fully to
                        other friendly dels on <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> in hopes they also
                        will try to influence Congolese along lines of para 1. (A) and (B) above. We
                        believe special effort should be made with Nigerian who stands best chance,
                        it seems to us, of countering immoderate attitude which Mali, Soviets, and
                        perhaps Uganda likely to foster.</p>
                    <p>3. Suggest you also notify Congolese that any U.S. statement will be
                        low-keyed and very carefully balanced in light of facts, most of which,
                        according to our information, do not support Congolese allegations.</p>

                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> opened the
                        conversation by saying that he had taken certain measures so that action on
                        the Congo Parliament’s resolution on the closing of foreign consulates would
                        be suspended until his return to Kinshasa. This had already been announced
                        on the radio. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> said he had
                        received the same news from the American Embassy in Kinshasa and he wished
                        to thank Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> for his
                        helpfulness.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> then turned to the Congo
                        complaint in the Security Council against Portugal on the subject of
                        Portugal’s alleged training of mercenaries for action against the
                            Congo.<note n="2" xml:id="d481fn2">On September 30, the Security Council
                            met to begin consideration of the Congolese complaint. On October 14, it
                            voted on a four-power (Jordan, Mali, Nigeria, and Uganda) draft
                            resolution. The first operative paragraph urging Portugal not to allow
                            foreign mercenaries to use Angola as a base of operation for interfering
                            in the domestic affairs of the Congo was adopted 11–0 with 4 abstentions
                            (France, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States).
                            Resolution 266 (1966), which also called upon all states to refrain or
                            desist from intervening in the domestic affairs of the Congo and
                            requested the Secretary-General to follow closely the implementation of
                            the resolution, was then adopted unanimously. (U.N. Doc. S/7539) For
                            text, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents,
                                1966</hi>, pp. 558–559.</note> The Foreign Minister said that the
                        Congo had taken into account the opinions of Security Council members and
                        that the first draft resolution, which was too strong, had been amended. The
                        Congo Delegation had itself been a Devil’s Advocate and had persuaded its
                        African friends to put together a resolution which demanded the minimum and
                        had a better chance to pass. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> said it would be difficult to go back to the Congo
                        without a resolution and he was therefore asking Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> as one who understood the situation
                        to help so that he could return as soon as possible to Kinshasa where he
                        wanted to protect President <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                        from demagogic <pb n="704" facs="0737" xml:id="pg_704"/> pressures. The
                        Foreign Minister said he would return immediately after the Security
                        Council’s intervention was completed. Reemphasizing the importance of his
                        returning to Kinshasa, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName>
                        explained that was why he had asked to see Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> today even though they were lunching together
                        tomorrow. He reiterated that the Congo was trying to arrive at a minimum
                        resolution and needed U.S. help. The Africans, he said, had rejected the
                        idea of a consensus put forward by the President of the Security Council.
                        This would not be understood in Kinshasa. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> then handed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> a copy of a draft resolution acceptable to the
                        Congo.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> thanked the Minister for
                        his explanation and said that as the latter knew the U.S. was doubtful as to
                        whether there was enough evidence to make a case in the S.C. As Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> understood it the U.S.
                        Delegation felt nothing had been proven and this presented difficulties for
                        the U.S. He said that he would, of course, have to discuss the matter with
                        Ambassador Goldberg and our other representatives as he had not actively
                        followed the debate. From what he did know, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> continued, the best resolution of the problem would
                        be a resolution permitting the case to end as gracefully as possible. The
                        Foreign Minister said it would not be understood at home if there were no
                        resolution. The Congo had proof and Portugal had agreed in the Security
                        Council debate that there are weapons for mercenaries in Angola. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> asked if this did not go
                        back several years. The Foreign Minister answered negatively stating that
                        Portugal admits weapons are there and if <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> returned he would get them. Paragraphs one and three
                        of the proposed resolution were the minimum that the Congo could accept. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> said the Congo could
                        show that such and such planes in Angola were Congolese. He repeated that
                        Portugal had agreed in its last speech in the S.C. that the arms were there.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> said he could sympathize
                        with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName>’s desire to return
                        to Kinshasa, that he would discuss the matter with Ambassador Goldberg and
                        would follow up with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName>
                        tomorrow. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> stated that in
                        this connection he understood that not only the closing of foreign
                        consulates had been suspended but also the Congo’s break with Portugal. The
                        Foreign Minister confirmed this.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> reminded the Foreign
                        Minister that a previous resolution of the S.C. urged the Congo to get rid
                        of its own mercenaries. He thought that if the Congo eliminated reference to
                        Portuguese territory in its own resolution, it would make the problem of
                        getting it through easier. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> did not seem to take kindly to this suggestion
                        although he did not altogether dismiss it.</p>

                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_HPI_1">Harmel</persName> and his aides
                        called on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> to discuss
                        relations among our two countries and the Congo (Kinshasa).</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> and Minister <persName corresp="#p_HPI_1">Harmel</persName> agreed that “emotionalism” has been
                        the basis for many recent decisions by President <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> characterized the Congolese President as possessed by
                        an “impetuous” tendency to carry things to the extreme without paying any
                        attention to the consequences. He cited the difficulties which friendly
                        powers such as Belgium and the United States have experienced in extending
                        advice to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, who often arrives
                        at decisions without consulting his Foreign Minister and others. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> underscored the Congolese
                        clumsiness in their effort to indict Portugal at the Security Council,
                        noting that such was especially foolish given the Congolese and Zambian need
                        to use the Benguela Railroad.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_HPI_1">Harmel</persName> noted that
                        poor administration and economic instability remain the Congo’s endemic
                        long-range problems. According to <persName corresp="#p_HPI_1">Harmel</persName>, there are already “too many Belgians” helping in
                        Congolese administrative functions. He prescribed the establishment of a
                        “government planning office”, with an international staff, to cope with the
                        myriad of Congolese administrative and economic woes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPI_1">Harmel</persName> was pessimistic concerning
                        the next ten years for the Congo. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> added that, despite the need for such institutions as
                            <pb n="706" facs="0739" xml:id="pg_706"/>“planning offices”, short-run
                        stability remains a key problem. For this reason, the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> supports continued assistance to the
                            <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> and public safety programs. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName> cited the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>’s recent performance in Kisangani as an
                        example that such assistance pays off. Viscount <persName corresp="#p_DVE_1">Davignon</persName> indicated that the Belgian military technicians
                        would not share this view but agreed that their standards were
                        unrealistically high. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPI_1">Harmel</persName>
                        noted that Belgium is agreeable to continuing support in these fields,
                        despite the fact that Belgian officers seem always to be accused by the
                        Congolese as representing various rival factions rather than being
                        considered as neutral advisors. For this reason in the future, Belgian
                        military are to serve strictly in training and advisory capacities, although
                        military transport pilots and others are to remain. Similarly, the Belgian
                        police program is expected to continue at its present level.</p>
                    <p>Concerning other aid, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_HPI_1">Harmel</persName> advised that Belgium will retain its 3.5 billion
                        Belgian franc global support to the Congo. Of this amount, approximately 1
                        billion <gloss target="#t_BF_1">BF</gloss> will go for education, health,
                        and agriculture. Should the Congo cause Belgium to incur expenses without
                        the latter’s concurrence, however, these costs will be deducted from the
                        remaining approximately 2.5 billion <gloss target="#t_BF_1">BF</gloss>. The
                            <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> has agreed to seek to fill the
                        250 million <gloss target="#t_BF_1">BF</gloss> “gap” between the 3.5 billion
                            <gloss target="#t_BF_1">BF</gloss> Belgian aid and the anticipated
                        Congolese budget, by turning to international organizations or through
                        budgetary acrobatics.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> noted that one
                        positive measure of the <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                        regime has been the improvement in the Congo’s relations with its neighbors.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> saw the return of
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> as leading to a setback
                        of these good relations, with the possibility that dissident movements again
                        would start up at the Congo’s borders. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPI_1">Harmel</persName> stated that Belgium seeks to continue good relations
                        with all former Congolese prime ministers, recognizing that one never can be
                        sure who next may become Premier. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPI_1">Harmel</persName> emphasized that the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> nevertheless continues to dissuade Belgian support for
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> from whatever quarter.
                        As evidence of this attitude, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPI_1">Harmel</persName> cited the fact that Brussels has asked <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> not to reside in Belgium because
                        of his continuing proclivity to engage in political activities. <persName corresp="#p_HPI_1">Harmel</persName> was particularly laudatory about
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>, who is “realistic and
                        intelligent,” and recommended him to the U.S.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPI_1">Harmel</persName> suggested that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> might prevail upon friendly participants
                        at the forthcoming <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> conference in Addis
                        Ababa in an effort to urge a moderate <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> stance towards Europeans. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> agreed that this was advisable, but
                        noted that extreme caution was necessary in order to prevent such an effort
                        from becoming known to the <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>. He added,
                        moreover, that Africans on their own are beginning to counsel <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> moderation, as witnessed by their
                        advising modification of the Congolese resolution against Portugal at the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <pb n="707" facs="0740" xml:id="pg_707"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPI_1">Harmel</persName> thanked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> for the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>’s moral and political assistance. He concluded that, with
                        hopeless elements such as Litho, the key need for the Congo was to translate
                        written reforms and idealistic statements into action. He added that his
                        meetings with <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> seemed to be
                        going along nicely although it appeared that we were more optimistic over
                        the Congo than he, <persName corresp="#p_HPI_1">Harmel</persName>, was. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> noted that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> has no desire to replace the Belgians in
                        the Congo and expressed the hope that this has been made adequately clear to
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>. In parting, both agreed
                        that it is most important at the present time to bolster the Congolese
                        confidence in the Belgians and the Americans and for us “to get on the same
                        wave length” as the Congolese.</p>

                            State–Defense–<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> working group to draw
                        up plans for the phase-out of the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not

                        factors to be considered. Following oral instructions from the Department of
                        State for an early phase-out, the Ambassador at Kinshasa has recommended
                        that the program end by 15 February 1967. This date cannot be met if a
                        condition of the phase-out is to be prior establishment by the <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> of an adequate replacement program.</p>

                        reduced. On 28 March 1966, the Committee reconsidered its decision pending
                        the results of a study by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. On 8 July, the
                        Committee agreed to await the results of impending talks between the U.S.

Station currently reassessing its relationship with [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] and [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>], [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] and assessing current <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> foreign policy developments in light of certain of

                    <p>3. [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s] insistence that
                            [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>] must go represents
                        complete reversal of his 8 Sept statements to [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] that his ([<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s]) disagreements with [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>] had been completely resolved. While there are no
                        doubt numerous factors which motivated [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] in reaching this decision, believe [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] was sincere when he patched up
                        relations with [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>]. However,
                            [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] decision to withold
                        air support during the late Sept Kisangani crisis was interpreted by
                            [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] as “proof” that
                            [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>] did not support the
                        govt. Despite the Station’s many assertions to the contrary, [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] continues blame [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>] for the decision to withold an air
                        strike and the resulting danger in which the regime was placed by this
                        decision.</p>
                    <p>4. In addition to the Kisangani problem, Station suspects [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] endeavoring establish himself as a
                        leader of the African states. In order achieve this objective, he probably
                        believes he must prove that he is not a “[U.S.] puppet”. Thus by demanding
                        recall [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>] suspect he thinks he
                        will be able demonstrate that he not under [U.S.] influence. This move may
                        well be followed by other actions designed to support the thesis that
                            [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] is truly an independent
                        African nationalist, and some of his moves will almost certainly appear
                        [anti-U.S.] in nature.<note n="4" xml:id="d484fn4">A Central Intelligence

                    <p>8761 (In 33138). 1. Have not submitted request for payment to [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] of [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym
                            not declassified</hi>] funds for September and October 1966. Station
                        immediate reaction when [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>]
                        requested [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>’s] departure was
                        that we should cut off all future payments. On reflection, however, Station
                        reached following conclusions:</p>
                    <p>A. Cutting off payments to [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>]
                        would almost certainly be interpreted by him as an indication that [<gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>] no longer supports him. Political
                        repercussions resulting from terminating [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not
                            declassified</hi>] payments would be almost as severe as if [<gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>] were to cut off [<gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>] funds.</p>
                    <p>B. Since [Department of State] has indicated it wishes retain all options,
                        Station believes it would not be advisable cut off [<gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>] payments. This particularly true since [<gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>] assistance must, view budgetary <pb n="711" facs="0744" xml:id="pg_711"/> cuts, be reduced. [<gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>] reductions can be explained on the basis
                        of budgetary reductions. However, cutting off [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym
                            not declassified</hi>] funds probably would convince [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] that [<gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>] reductions are punitive in nature, rather than the result
                        of a budgetary cut.</p>
                    <p>2. Station has discussed above thinking with [<persName corresp="#p_BRO_1">Blake</persName>]. Latter is reluctant approve additional [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] payments to [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>]. Just prior his departure
                            [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>] expressed view that
                            [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] should be taught lesson
                        by having [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] funds cut off.
                        Since [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] has not raised the
                        issue, Station has not pushed the matter with [<persName corresp="#p_BRO_1">Blake</persName>]. However, suspect we will have to face this problem
                        eventually, as [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] probably
                        will query Station concerning [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not
                            declassified</hi>] funds next time he short of cash for political action
                        ops.</p>
                    <p>3. Above views submitted for headquarters information in any discussions it
                        may have with [<persName corresp="#p_GGM_1">Godley</persName>] and
                        [Department of State] on subject of [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not
                            declassified</hi>] funding.</p>
                    <p>4. Would appreciate Headquarters guidance as to position Station should adopt

                        Program</p>
                    <p>a. The long-standing desire to turn over the U.S.-operated Congolese Air
                        Force and pocket Navy to the host government came under discussion on
                        Friday, 4 November. Tabled were two papers from the <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>, one from <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, and two
                        draft cables from State Department to Kinshasa.</p>
                    <p>b. Without a paragraph by paragraph overhaul, it was abundantly clear that
                        the Committee was in agreement that a turnover be effected with all
                        convenient speed but with minimum sacrifice to efficiency and order.</p>
                    <p>c. All agreed that the key to the question was to find an airline executive
                        or experienced operations officer to manage the air force for <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>. The candidates, of course, would
                        have to be satisfactory to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>.
                        It was also agreed that a non-American would be preferable and that <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> would undertake the “talent scouting.”</p>
                    <p>d. Declining to be bound by any deadlines, the Committee principals pointed
                        out that with the Congolese penchant for failing to meet payrolls, the
                        Agency might be some time in getting out from under. The pocket Navy was
                        believed to present a somewhat less complicated problem in transfer.</p>
                    <p>e. Following the meeting, State drafted four <gloss target="#t_Roger_1">Roger</gloss> channel cables to Kinshasa (Nos. 81702, 81703, 81709, and
                            81710)<note n="2" xml:id="d486fn2">None found.</note> offering general
                        guidance on the intent of the Committee. The Executive Secretary believes
                        that these messages contain an umbrella of accurate guidance under which the
                        parties concerned can proceed to search for solutions.</p>
                    <p>f. It was further agreed that the steps envisaged would, when necessary, be
                        discussed in confidence with both the Belgian and Italian governments.</p>

                    <p>103125. 1. Ramiro Rodriguez and Mike Pons, self-styled <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> emissaries, approached <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> December 13 with letter to President from
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. The two men stated
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> had told them avoid
                        Department of State since <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> could be
                        expected be more sympathetic <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s aims. In initial contact, they informed <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> officials they wished to furnish oral
                        briefing and request US support and assistance for <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>.</p>
                    <p>2. After checking with Department for guidance, Rodriguez and Pons received
                        morning of December 14 at <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> in presence
                        State officer (not identified as such to them). They furnished long rambling
                        briefing about satisfactory state Congolese affairs when <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> was Prime Minister and how bad
                        they are now, as well as list of benefits which would accrue to West and
                        capitalism if <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> returned. They
                        requested loan of $4 million to assist <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, who, they claimed, expected return Kinshasa no
                        later than December 31.</p>
                    <p>3. In line with State guidance, <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>
                        officials informed them of following:</p>
                    <p>a) US does not intervene in internal affairs of other nations.</p>
                    <p>b) US has supported every central government of Congo since independence and
                        continues that policy.</p>
                    <p>c) Communications re foreign affairs should be submitted to Dept of State and
                        if letter given to <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> officials latter
                        would transmit it to State for forwarding.</p>
                    <p>d) US will not support or assist in any plot or scheme to overthrow the
                        present government.</p>
                    <p>4. In view this negative response to request for assistance, emissaries
                        decided not to give letter to <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>. They
                        added that other sources, notably France, had offered support which
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> had earlier refused but
                        intimated they would turn back to such sources. Added that when <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> comes to power, he will be
                        friendly with US but refusal to assist him now would affect relations with
                        US.</p>
                    <p>4. [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] At time original contact Dec. 13, <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> officials actually saw unsigned copy of
                        letter which they said was essentially recital of conditions in Congo. Net
                        impression of those attending Dec. 14 meeting was that this not a serious
                        undertaking which leads us to wonder whether <pb n="714" facs="0747" xml:id="pg_714"/>two men actually reflecting <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s views on anything other than
                        letter itself.</p>
                    <p>5. On Dec. 15 <gloss target="#t_Deptoff_1">Deptoff</gloss> saw <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName>, who, although he claims no
                        present association with <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>,
                        may be in communication with him. He was informed in general terms of this
                        approach. <gloss target="#t_Deptoff_1">Deptoff</gloss> suggested <persName corresp="#p_SMI_1">Struelens</persName> might clearly inform <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> that the US will not support any
                        plot or scheme to depose <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                        government.</p>
                    <p>6. Embassy should inform <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> in
                        general terms this approach and of US reaction. We do not exclude the
                        possibility that Rodriguez and Pons will attempt to peddle letter elsewhere
                        in Washington for delivery to the White House.<note n="2" xml:id="d487fn2">Telegram 110241 to Kinshasa, December 29, reported that Rodriguez and
                            Pons called at the Department on December 28, asked for U.S. support of
                            a future <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> government, and
                            left a letter for the President. They said they were not seeking active
                            U.S. support for a move against <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, but asking for “benevolent neutrality” if
                                <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> forces attempted a
                            coup, i.e., a commitment not to let U.S.-controlled aircraft in the
                            Congo be used against <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                            forces. They were informed that the United States continued to support
                            the central government and did not support plots to overthrow it, and
                            that the aircraft in the Congo were part of the Congolese forces and
                                <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> should not assume
                            they would not be used against forces attempting a coup. (Ibid.) No copy
                            of the letter to the President has been found.</note></p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The situation in the Congo continues to deteriorate. It may become grave, and
                        the lives of Belgians and other whites may be endangered to the point where
                        some kind of rescue operation may be required.</p>
                    <p>1. The crisis in the Congo has become worse. Severe economic dislocations now
                        seem almost certain, with possible attendant dangers to <pb n="715" facs="0748" xml:id="pg_715"/>the Belgians and other whites. Given the
                        intransigence of the Union Minière and the ill-considered and erratic
                        actions of the Congolese, eleventh-hour efforts by the Belgian Government to
                        arrange a deal between <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and
                        the Union Minière have only faint prospects of success.<note n="2" xml:id="d488fn2">In December 1966, the Congo had announced the takeover
                            of the Union Minière company without compensation. The company
                            retaliated by stopping remittance of foreign exchange, putting the Congo
                            on the verge of economic collapse.</note> Though copper production in
                        Katanga continues, none is exported, and the Congo’s foreign exchange
                        reserves are gone. The lack of foreign exchange to replenish low stocks of
                        mining equipment and spare parts, as well as to meet the payroll, is likely
                        to bring mining operations to a halt fairly soon.</p>
                    <p>2. In these circumstances, one of the most serious eventualities which looms
                        ahead is the threat of violence against the 2,000 Belgian employees of Union
                        Minière and their families in Katanga. Most are eager to leave the Congo as
                        soon as possible, and have been encouraged to do so by the Union Minière
                        though it would take weeks to move all the 6,000 or so people involved. If
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> permits a substantial
                        number to leave, the copper industry will close down very quickly. It would
                        be virtually impossible to replace key employees for many months. If the
                        Congolese attempt to prevent the departure of the Belgians, racial tensions
                        will mount, and incidents are likely to arise which will endanger lives. If
                        the copper industry comes to a halt, Congolese officials will probably
                        accuse local Belgians of sabotage, and the already strongly anti-Belgian
                        Congolese press and radio will probably take up the cry. The Congolese army,
                        thus far under orders to prevent harassment of Belgians, may get out of
                        control, and such order as exists may break down.</p>
                    <p>3. We believe the chances are increasing that anti-Belgian or anti-white
                        incidents will lead to a situation wherein the lives of many Europeans in
                        Katanga, and perhaps in the rest of the Congo, would be in danger. There are
                        some 40,000 Belgians in the Congo (including about 15,000 in Katanga); there
                        are also some 40,000 other whites, including 1,000 to 1,500 US citizens,
                        most of whom are scattered in other parts of the country. Clearly, a rescue
                        operation to evacuate even US nationals would be very difficult, and an
                        effort to remove all Europeans vastly more so. The situation may not
                        deteriorate this far; it is impossible to predict Congolese events with
                        confidence. But in view of the recent turbulent history of the country and
                        the critical nature of the present troubles, such a contingency should be
                        kept in mind.</p>

                        information memo.<note n="2" xml:id="d489fn2">Document 488.</note> I haven’t
                        much to add. It is an accurate picture of the present situation, and the
                        inferences it draws for future developments are entirely plausible. The only
                        compensating fact is that one could have as plausibly predicted imminent
                        disaster for the Congo on any given day for the past six months, but nothing
                        catastrophic has happened.</p>
                    <p>However, there is no question that danger has reached a new octave in
                        January. We now have a very real threat of mass departures by Belgian whites
                        critical to the mining industry—because of unwillingness to work for the new
                        Congolese firm and/or because the Congolese have no foreign exchange to pay
                        them. This will magnify pressures on <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> to refuse to let them leave. (He has already issued
                        and rescinded one directive forcing them to give a year’s notice.) If he
                        acts, Union Minière will have the Belgian Government right where it wants
                        them, and there will be great pressure on us to help the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> guarantee the safe departure of what will
                        by then probably be the majority of whites in the Congo. Nothing could be
                        worse for Congolese economics and politics.</p>
                    <p>The way out is to:</p>
                    <p>1. Find a way to settle the money issues between the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and Union Minière—probably through arbitration—so that
                            <gloss target="#t_UM_1">UM</gloss> will stop blocking sales of Congolese
                        copper.</p>
                    <p>2. Set up a new marketing mechanism to replace Union Minière.</p>
                    <p>3. Get <gloss target="#t_UM_1">UM</gloss> or other experienced corporations
                        to sell technical assistance to the new Congolese corporation so that
                        production continues at a reasonable level.</p>
                    <p>The arbitration of outstanding issues is, once again, beginning to look

                    <p>I have followed this one fairly closely, putting my oar in from time to time
                        as it seemed necessary. I am satisfied that we are playing our

                        effectiveness. In my view, we should continue to do what we can to promote
                        reason on both sides, and sweat it out.<note n="3" xml:id="d489fn3">In

                        soonest in order make following points:</p>
                    <p>2) We continue support Central Govt in Congo as we always have and cannot
                        condone extra legal attempts overthrow that govt. At same time we believe
                        that if <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> is to project desirable image
                        as progressive, stable African leader, full and careful consideration should
                        be given to possible international reaction to trial. Repeat of trials
                        followed by summary executions of last spring could well have adverse effect
                        on Congo’s image throughout world.</p>
                    <p>3) You should make it plain we are not trying to give any opinion or exert
                        any type of influence on outcome of trial. Our hope is that Congo Govt aware
                        implications of trials and possible public executions on its good name as
                        well as possible effect on general attitudes towards African states. Basic
                        questions will be asked such as was there adequate opportunity for defense

                        have no facility themselves for adequate maintenance. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD_1">Kohler</persName> emphasized that the Agency should
                        move with all convenient speed to transfer the responsibility and costs of

                            turnover.<note n="2" xml:id="d492fn2">A March 3 <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> progress report to <persName corresp="#p_HRI_1">Helms</persName> on the phaseout of the air program in the Congo
                            noted that the report was being submitted in time to alert the 303
                            Committee to the fact that the pace of the phaseout had been delayed
                            somewhat by circumstances beyond the Agency’s control and thus might

                            continued, the report proposed that it be extended on a month-to-month
                            basis, but estimated that it seemed likely that the extension period
                            would not exceed 3 months. (Central Intelligence Agency Files, Job
                            81–00966R, Congo, 1967–68)</note> He said that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> had been unable to address himself
                        to the “air force” problem because of his total involvement with the Belgian
                        holding companies. He had not yet made any final agreement with the retired
                        Turkish air force general who would hold the position of “air manager”.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> had not yet held talks
                        with [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]
                        representatives on payment of salaries to pilots and mechanics. There was
                        more than a possibility that he would not be able to meet this payroll with
                        hard currency. In such a case, the embassy would have to pick up the tab to
                        prevent a total incapacity for flight operations.</p>
                    <p>b. Despite these clouds, the committee felt that the transfer should proceed
                        as rapidly as possible. Should difficulties emerge they could be referred
                        back to the committee. In any event, a progress report was called for by
                        mid-May 1967.</p>

                    <p>We recommend that no reply be made to the letter to the President from Moise
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> of March 9.<note n="2" xml:id="d493fn2">A typed notation on the original reads: “White House

                            reply necessary (Judy Stewart to jmj, 5/17/67).” A copy of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s letter to the President is
                            ibid.</note></p>
                    <p>You will recall that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, for
                        his own political purposes, has used several methods and individuals to try
                        to establish contact with the President. Any reply to this letter, no matter
                        how innocuous, would lend itself to exploitation by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> for those political purposes and
                        could thus seriously affect our friendly relations with the present <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>. The trial of which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> has written has been concluded,
                        resulting in death sentences for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, Colonel Tshipola, who is specifically mentioned in
                        the <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> letter, and one other
                        officer and sentences of various lengths for four other people, including
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s brother. One officer
                        was acquitted.</p>
                    <p>At our instruction, before the conclusion of the trial, our Chargé in
                        Kinshasa impressed upon the Congolese Foreign Minister, the necessity of
                        avoiding the kind of kangaroo court procedures and brutal executions which
                        followed the discovery of the pentacost plot in 1966. Nevertheless, with the
                        exception of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, his brother,
                        and possibly the other civilian involved, Colonel Tshipola and the other
                        officers were essentially tried for a mutiny which resulted in the death of
                        the Congolese Army Commander, Colonel Tshatshi, in Kisangani, as well as
                        other military and civilian personnel.</p>
                    <p>We believe it serves no useful purpose to make any additional efforts with
                        the Congolese Government concerning an essentially domestic matter. There is
                        little question that the verdict against the two <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> brothers is a political one and
                        cannot be justified especially since no true defense was permitted. Both
                        Tshombes are in Europe and <pb n="722" facs="0755" xml:id="pg_722"/>it is
                        unlikely that any country would permit their extradition even if the
                        Congolese Government requested it.</p>

                    <p>1. It is requested that Project [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not

                        approved on 13 August 1964, in partial implementation of a 303 Committee
                        decision 13 August 1964, approving covert aid at a level of [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] to support the Congo
                        (Kinshasa) central government against the rebels. To this end, a wide
                        variety of activities were mounted under this project, but by the renewal
                        for <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1967 they had been reduced to two:
                        covert support of President <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                        and the maintenance of a maritime patrol capability on Lake Tanganyika.</p>
                    <p>2. Termination of this project is requested because changed political
                        conditions in the Congo have eliminated the need for a continuation of the
                        above activities. Rebel activity in the eastern Congo has all but ended.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> is seeking to project an
                        African nationalist image of himself and his government and has not
                        requested further covert funding since the payment due him for September
                        1966. 303 Committee authority to make such payments expired on 31 December
                        1966, and there are no present plans to request authority for a new series
                        of <pb n="723" facs="0756" xml:id="pg_723"/>payments. In compliance with a
                        303 decision of 4 November 1966, to phase out U.S. Government participation
                        in the maritime program, control of the boats was transferred to the
                        Congolese authorities on 7 January 1967. All [<hi rend="italic">less than 1

                        maritime program have been withdrawn from the Congo.</p>

                        cleared with Department. “Dear Mr. Minister: Your letter of January 26
                        expressing the concern of the Congolese Govt over rumors that forces have
                        been gathering in adjacent territory to launch an aggression against the
                        Congo, has been carefully considered by my Govt.</p>
                    <p>2. I have been instructed to assure you that, while my Govt cannot confirm
                        reliability of these rumors, it nevertheless hopes that the efforts and
                        accomplishments of the <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> to achieve
                        stability and security <pb n="724" facs="0757" xml:id="pg_724"/>and assure
                        political, economic and social development will not be thwarted by renewed
                        threats of violence in the Congo.</p>
                    <p>3. You further expressed a desire to ascertain the attitude of the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> in case the Congo should become the object
                        of external aggression organized by foreigners or Congolese. As you know it
                        has been the policy of the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>, through the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and in consultation with the <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> and its friends and supporters, to
                        support the maintenance of the territorial integrity and political
                        independence of the Congo against external aggression. This policy is fully
                        consistent with the U.N. Charter. Actions taken in the U.N. were the basis
                        for the consultation and cooperation by the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> with your Govt in its efforts to maintain the territorial
                        integrity and unity of the Congo after, as well as before, the departure of
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> forces. You may recall I have made
                        this attitude of my Govt unmistakably clear in earlier conversations. It was
                        reaffirmed most recently in the statement issued by the Embassy on February
                        24 of this year. I wish to take this occasion to reiterate in this same
                        context that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> remains ready to
                        consult with the <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> on all such
                        questions of common interest.</p>
                    <p>4. The Congolese Govt’s appreciation of the value of US assistance, also
                        noted in your letter, has been warmly received by my Govt and interpreted as
                        a reflection of the traditionally close and friendly relations existing
                        between our two countries.”<note n="3" xml:id="d495fn3">In telegram 6878

                    <p>The Secretary began the conversation by telling Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> that the Congo continues to be an
                        important preoccupation of the United States Government, that what happens
                        there is of the deepest interest to us and is followed very closely. The
                        Ambassador said that he had recently been in Kinshasa where he was asked by
                        Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> to bring
                        greetings and best wishes to the Secretary and to the American people. As a
                        result of his stay in Kinshasa the Ambassador was optimistic over the future
                        prospects of his country. Thanks to U.S. aid and the success of the
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> regime, the situation has
                        been stabilized and the rebellion is disappearing despite several remaining
                        pockets. The Congo now has friendly relations with its neighbors and must
                        now make an effort to improve its economic situation. The <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> regime has deep popular support and
                        its reforms have been well received by the people. The net result of the
                        reforms already instituted and those contemplated will be the creation of a
                        new base of confidence for foreign investment, particularly American foreign
                        investment. The Ambassador said that he had been asked by his government to
                        convey its thanks and those of the Congolese people to the American
                        Government and people for their indispensable help in creating these
                        favorable conditions.</p>

                        Stanleyville</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked if there was any residue of ill will toward the United
                        States as a result of our involvement in the November 24, 1964 rescue
                        operation in Stanleyville. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> replied that the general population was certainly
                        afraid when they heard of the paradrop on Stanleyville but that they soon
                        realized that the rescue operation benefited not only foreign hostages of
                        the rebels but also Congolese <pb n="726" facs="0759" xml:id="pg_726"/>
                        hostages. It was a humanitarian act benefiting everyone involved. Now the
                        people have forgotten the incident and no longer talk about it except for a
                        few interested individuals. There is no discernible resentment against the
                        United States and Belgium for this operation.</p>

                        State and Central Intelligence Agency officials met at the Department of
                        State on May 11, 1967, to discuss termination of the U.S. Government air
                        program in the Congo. Dean Brown of the Bureau of African Affairs indicated
                        that the bureau’s position would be that the U.S. Government could not
                        afford to lose air capability in the Congo through the loss of effective
                        maintenance organization. Both Brown and John <persName corresp="#p_MJW_1">MacDonald</persName> of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research
                        proposed that <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> provide funds for [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] to get it started

                        contacts between <persName corresp="#p_DLA_1">Devlin</persName> and a number
                        of Congolese nationalists in Brussels. The relationship has been
                        strengthened by seven years of close and continuing contact in Kinshasa
                        since independence. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] have become accustomed to and
                        to some degree dependent on the informal channel to the U.S. Government thus
                        provided. On a number of occasions, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has sought an extension of <persName corresp="#p_DLA_1">Devlin</persName>’s tour in Kinshasa (most recently
                        in a conversation with Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB_1">Katzenbach</persName>) and has said that after <persName corresp="#p_DLA_1">Devlin</persName> leaves he will expect to maintain

                            Kinshasa to <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, March 14, the Chief of
                            Station reported that he told <persName corresp="#p_BRO_1">Blake</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> was planning to make a formal request that his
                            recall to Headquarters be delayed until November. <persName corresp="#p_BRO_1">Blake</persName> then told him that it had been
                            decided at the “highest levels” that after the Chief of Station’s
                            departure, <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> must terminate all
                            contacts with <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]. Noting that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> was already suspicious
                            concerning the reasons behind his scheduled departure, the Chief of
                            Station said that the Station believed the Department of State edict
                            represented a serious error in judgment which could jeopardize <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>’s whole position in the Congo, the
                            position of the new Ambassador (whom <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> would almost certainly blame for the decision),
                            and even overall U.S.-Congolese relations. The Chief of Station pointed
                            out that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> had been in
                            regular and close contact with <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> for
                            nearly 7 years and might not permit <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                            contact to be maintained at subordinate levels. (Ibid.)</note></p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and [<hi rend="italic">name
                            not declassified</hi>] would interpret the termination of this
                        relationship—particularly if termination were more or less coincident on
                            <persName corresp="#p_DLA_1">Devlin</persName>’s departure—as evidence
                        of a desire on the part of the U.S. Government to disengage from the close
                        and friendly relations that have characterized dealings between the
                        governments of the two countries for most of the period since 1960.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s regime is essentially a
                        personal one. Relationships between non-Africans and Africans are
                        essentially of a personal, non-institutionalized nature. Since <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has himself personally appealed for
                        a continuation of the relationship, he would almost certainly interpret its
                        termination as evidence that forces within the U.S. Government hostile to
                        him personally had <pb n="728" facs="0761" xml:id="pg_728"/>gained strength.
                        He would also almost certainly identify Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName> with these hostile forces, since
                        the termination would occur shortly after the Ambassador’s arrival in
                        Kinshasa, and since the only way the termination could be explained to
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> would be to tell him that
                        orders to this effect had been received from Washington.</p>
                    <p>3. From a more parochial point of view, the termination of the Station’s
                        contact with <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> under these
                        circumstances would immediately be reflected in a weakening if not a rupture
                        of the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]
                        relationships established [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>], relationships that would play an essential role in
                        planned efforts to improve our coverage of the Bloc target in Brazzaville
                        and to provide adequate coverage of the Soviets when they reestablish
                        themselves in Kinshasa. The end of the <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> relationship would also probably remove what has
                        amounted to a protective umbrella over Station [<hi rend="italic">less than
                            1 line not declassified</hi>] operations in the Congo, [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines not declassified</hi>].</p>
                    <p>4. Thus it is our conviction that such a termination would have serious
                        adverse effects on U.S. Government relations with the <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>. On the other hand, a continuation of
                        the present relationship, carefully coordinated with the Ambassador in the
                        future as it has been in the past, would avoid any such adverse effects
                        while providing the Ambassador with a useful additional means of explaining
                        U.S. policies and bringing U.S. influence to bear on the <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>.</p>

                        Schultze recommend approval of a $17 million loan to the Congo. Schultze’s
                        memorandum (Tab A)<note n="2" xml:id="d501fn2">Neither tab is attached.
                            Copies of these memoranda are ibid., Memos to the President, <persName corresp="#p_REV_1">Walt Rostow</persName>, Vol. 32.</note> gives you
                        a concise summary of the proposal, the self-help conditions, and the
                        economic outlook. <persName corresp="#p_GWS_1">Gaud</persName>’s memorandum
                        (Tab B) provides greater detail. At Tab C is a summary of the economic
                        stabilization program of which this loan would be a part.</p>
                    <p>This loan is proposed in the following policy framework:</p>
                    <pb n="731" facs="0764" xml:id="pg_731"/>
                    <p>1. Having helped to achieve a reasonably stable and unified Congo, we are now
                        gradually shifting from a very close paternal connection with the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> to a more standard relation between
                        independent nations. This makes very good sense for the interests of both
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>2. A major part of this shift is a trend away from slush funds and toward
                        genuine development aid. In 1962 and 1963, we were making huge grants to the
                        Congo. We later shifted to loans. We are now making the loans smaller (this
                        is $2 million smaller than last year’s). Within two years, we plan to
                        eliminate supporting assistance loans altogether.</p>
                    <p>3. As the loans grow smaller, the self-help terms grow tougher. This loan is
                        conditioned on a complete monetary and economic stabilization program,
                        administered by the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss>. With luck, it will
                        put the basically-strong Congolese economy back into self-sustaining
                        shape.</p>
                    <p>4. We are a minority financier in the Congo. Even including food, we are
                        providing less than one-fourth of her aid. The great bulk of it comes from
                        the Belgians, the Italians and the EEC, along with the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Despite these trends, and the very real economic progress the Congo has
                        achieved during the past two years, we should not give you the impression
                        that the sailing is smooth. The Congo survives more perils every week than
                        Pauline ever dreamed of. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> is
                        particularly susceptible to the urge to cut his own throat by finding new
                        ways to kick the Belgians. Thus, the Congolese stability we talk about is
                        very fragile.</p>
                    <p>It is fair to say, however, that this loan is necessary for any stability,
                        and that, whatever its weaknesses, the present situation is the most stable
                        in recent history. Therefore, I recommend that you approve.</p>

                        MPR Political Bureau had met at length on Sat night and had decided under
                        circumstances it essential that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> be extradited and punished. Basis of extradition,
                        papers for which had been carefully prepared, was common crimes committed by
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. There strong popular

                        is center of or excuse for continuing disorder and sabotage in Congo.
                        Pro-Tshombists were responsible for Lubudi bridge bombings and economic

                        but urged that we in turn recognize that <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> had no other alternative but to demand <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s extradition once <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> in African hands. I told <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> that I had no desire interfere in
                        internal affairs of Congo and that I not acting on instructions, but as
                        friend of Congo. I felt personally obliged to warn him of strong reaction I
                        expected and to urge him to handle <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> affair quickly, with justice and without starting
                        what would seem to be extensive purge trials. <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> took all this very seriously and said he would
                        report at once to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Occasion offered by <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> comment on relation <gloss target="#t_GA_1">GA</gloss> vote to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> extradition gave me perfect opportunity to knock
                        home what I was sure would be US views on <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> affair. Am convinced however that we have not
                        slightest chance of changing <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s fate and in fact I do not think this would be
                        appropriate course of action for us to attempt. We have plenty of evidence
                        that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> has done everything he
                        can to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> govt through
                        subversion, mercenaries, etc. Furthermore what <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> told me is basically true, namely that if <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> had had chance to regain political
                        power through violent means, he would not have shrunk from causing deaths of
                        many Congolese or from wiping out present govt. Seems to me that only
                        constructive course open for us at this point is to try ensure that
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>’s trial and inevitable
                        execution don’t get out of hand. We will continue act quietly in that sense
                        unless Dept objects.</p>

                        was a Congo (Kinshasa) operation mounted primarily by Minister of Transport

                        collaboration with the Algerians and that the Congolese had sent a mission

                        stated that the operation had its origin some months ago. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] however, did not volunteer any details
                        regarding the operation other than to state that the key individual in the

                        an unidentified European but not former Five Commando Mercenary Leader Lt.

                    <p>3. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] also stated that an
                        official Congolese delegation had departed for Algeria on 3 July which
                        included Colonel Alexandre Singa, Chief Administrator of the Sûreté

                        Kinshasa for trial and execution. [<hi rend="italic">name not
                            declassified</hi>] emphasized that such action was purely and simply an
                        act of self-defense on the part of Congolese President <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Joseph Mobutu</persName>’s govt against an individual
                        who has repeatedly sought to subvert and overthrow the <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> regime and who has plotted the

                    <p>4. Although [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] tended to minimize
                        the effect of possible adverse international reaction to the <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> affair, he did express interest
                        bordering on concern in what the Spanish reaction might be to the
                        kidnapping. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] stated that the
                        Congolese Chargé in Madrid had informed Kinshasa that Spanish officials had
                        unofficially indicated that <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        would not be permitted to reenter Spain should he extricate himself from his

                        the Congolese “agents” had fled Spain after the kidnapping in fear of being
                        arrested by the Spanish authorities and that he suspected that those
                        Congolese remaining in Spain were under close surveillance.<note n="3" xml:id="d503fn3">A July 9 <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> report

                        me this morning in presence <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName>

                        vital psychologically and politically, if his pro-Western policy to be
                        continued.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> emphasized that he as
                        pro-Western Congolese leader with particularly close relations to us, in
                        very difficult situation. Most of troubles which Congo has had since
                        independence have come from West, and particularly from Belgium. Right now
                        Belgian, French, Spanish and English mercenaries, backed by Belgian
                        financial interests, <pb n="737" facs="0770" xml:id="pg_737"/>are engaged in

                        govt. These groups will spare no efforts to overthrow DGRC. On July 4, DGRC
                        found out through its intelligence sources in Belgium that 200 Belgian
                        mercenaries in pay of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> about
                        to depart from Belgium for Congo. When this info brought to attention
                        Belgian Govt, latter prohibited group from leaving. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> said he not accusing Belgian Govt
                        of being responsible for this latest mercenary rebellion, but fact is that
                        two plane loads of Belgian mercenaries arrived in Kisangani on morning July
                        5 from someplace.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> said there tendency his own
                        entourage but more strongly throughout Congo to blame these latest
                        difficulties not only on Belgians but on all whites. Gen Basongo in
                        Luluabourg had requested permission arrest all Belgians which permission was
                        denied. He, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, making every
                        effort calm down situation, but he under strong pressure. MPR had wished to
                        hold rally against Belgians and West, but he, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, denied requests as he did trade union request hold
                        anti-Belgian general strike and Louvanium students request hold major
                        demonstration in front Belgian Emb. <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> chimed in to say anti-white feelings running so
                        strong that he feared unless something done to redress balance and show that
                        at least <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> stands squarely with DGRC
                        against rebels, there is distinct possibility that security situation in
                        various parts of Congo could get out of hand and many whites might be
                        massacred.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> said he also under
                        pressure, “and not only from young radical intellectuals,” to reverse
                        pro-Western foreign policy and move to align Congo with African countries
                        who have close relations with Communists. Said it often pointed out to him
                        that countries like Congo (Brazza), Guinea and Tanzania have no problems
                        with mercenaries; only Western-oriented country like Congo faces these
                        troubles. Said if he could not get immediate aid from West, he will be faced
                        with strong pressures to re-orient his policies. In this respect, time is of
                        essence.</p>
                    <p>5. In response to my question as to whether other countries and particularly
                        Belgium had been asked for aid, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> replied in negative. Said it would be politically
                        impossible for him under present conditions to request help from Belgian
                        paratroopers or to otherwise use Belgian soldiers. He has asked for and
                        received assurances of Belgian political support plus Belgian assurances
                        they will deny use Belgian territory by pro-<persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> Belgian groups. However, only real military aid on
                        which he could count was from <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>6. On political side, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> said he
                        hopes <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> will meet soonest to consider what
                        steps <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> can take to deny support to
                        mercenaries. Also said he has requested total African support from every
                        African state through <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> channel. Finally,
                        he has also kept Chiefs of State of 13 countries which had participated in
                        Kinshasa summit conference fully <pb n="738" facs="0771" xml:id="pg_738"/>informed and has asked them take urgent measures deny use their
                        territories, airfields, etc. to allies of mercenaries.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> said military situation in
                        East remains nearly static but he must very quickly show that he is able to
                        take counteroffensive against rebel mercenaries. For this he particularly
                        needs immediate help from <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>. I said I
                        would transmit this request urgently to Washington. I had started meeting by
                        reading him message contained State 1291;<note n="2" xml:id="d505fn2">Dated

                    <p>1. All evidence points to conclusion that <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> is mesmerized by supposed mercenary invulnerability. We
                        see little indication that <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> taking any
                        steps in its own defense but is largely engaged in closing airports,
                        imposing curfew, arresting FAC pilots and making statements about
                        imperialist aggression. Even if aid were forthcoming there no evidence that
                            <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> has any idea of how to use
                        it.</p>
                    <p>2. Although we have no illusion about capabilities of <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> we nevertheless believe it could be doing
                        more than it is. Therefore you should on appropriate occasions try to
                        instill sense of confidence in Congolese leaders that numerically superior,
                        better-equipped <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> can handle
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>3. You should strongly discourage any mention of US troops. In view our
                        commitments elsewhere and US policy not to engage its own <pb n="739" facs="0772" xml:id="pg_739"/>forces in Africa it most unlikely that they
                        would be forthcoming under any circumstances.</p>
                    <p>4. As you have correctly pointed out major military problem, as usual, is
                        logistical. We are urgently considering recommendations of your 154. You
                        should suggest to <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> that its military
                            <gloss target="#t_reps_1">reps</gloss> consult with US and Belgian
                        military to make best and most effective use of significant amount of air
                        transport it already has.</p>
                    <p>5. We realize that this provisional response to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> appeal will probably not be considered very
                        forthcoming but at this stage suspect hand-holding operation is in order. In
                        some manner idea must be got-ten across that Congolese in first instance
                        must depend on themselves.</p>
                    <p>6. We doubt <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> disposed send combat troops
                        to Congo which <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> says he would
                        not request in any case. But we see no reason that <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> should not ask <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> for
                        equipment and supplies. Eventual US response could also depend on other

                        the Congo. The State memorandum contains <pb n="740" facs="0773" xml:id="pg_740"/> a good summary of the background of this decision and
                        the costs and benefits involved.</p>
                    <p>There is little visceral satisfaction in helping <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>. He is irritating and often stupid. By our standards,
                        he can be cruel to the point of inhumanity. It is perfectly true that he is
                        trying to get his hands on <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>,
                        and if he succeeds there is an excellent chance <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> will hang. However, we have to balance these facts
                        against some others—just as hard, cold, and unattractive:</p>
                    <p>1. Political stability in the Congo is the key to manageable African
                        politics. The Congo is almost as large as India and has much the same
                        dominance over the tone of African politics that India does on the
                        sub-Continent. It would be disastrous to retreat to the Congo of a few years
                        ago where warring regional factions created chaos simply begging for
                        big-power involvement which could spread the arms race to Africa and lead to
                        an eventual big-power confrontation.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s regime is by far the most
                        stable and widely-supported in Congolese history. It is the first that has
                        some semblance of mass support. It is vigorously supported (and <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> rigorously hated) by every country
                        of black Africa.</p>
                    <p>3. There is no other Congolese leader in sight who stands a reasonable chance
                        of holding the country together, much less maintaining the present friendly
                        relations with us.</p>
                    <p>4. Whatever <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s personal faults,
                        he has made some impressive economic steps. The <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> is now about to install and support—with help from us and
                        other countries—a comprehensive economic stabilization program which is by
                        far the best hope yet of changing a land basically rich in resources from an
                        international beggar (which costs us on the order of $50 million per year in
                        aid) into a cohesive, productive economy.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> does have alternatives. He
                        is under great pressure to denounce us and throw in his lot with the radical
                        Africans and, by implication, the Soviets and/or the Chicoms. Though this
                        would give the communist brethren some problems, it would be a major
                        political problem for us—foreign and domestic.</p>
                    <p>With these facts in mind, your advisers have arrived at the recommendation
                        that we supply three transport planes and crews. This recommendation is a
                        result of a careful examination of our four major options: to do nothing; to
                        try to finesse the problem through clandestine help to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>; to provide the aircraft he has
                        requested; and to throw the whole problem into the lap of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, taking no bilateral action in the
                        meantime.</p>
                    <p>We are agreed that to do nothing would risk very serious dangers ranging from
                        the splintering of the Congo to a sharp turn to the left in <pb n="741" facs="0774" xml:id="pg_741"/>Congolese political orientation, perhaps
                        involving military operations by the Algerians and other hostile forces now
                        smarting from their defeat in the Middle East and looking for a way to
                        recoup. As to the second alternative, there just doesn’t seem to be a way
                        that we can covertly give <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                        what he needs. He simply doesn’t have the air transport capability to move
                        his men and vehicles in the numbers and with the speed necessary to snuff
                        out the mutiny quickly. The <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> is already
                        addressing the problem—the Security Council met this afternoon. But <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> action would undoubtedly take time,
                        particularly if it involved blessing American assistance. The Soviets might
                        well block any such resolution in the hope that meanwhile their friends
                        could get into the act and get the credit. (Obviously, this does not mean we
                        would oppose <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> action in any event, but it
                        does not appear to us that we can lean on the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> as a substitute for modest bilateral help to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>.)</p>
                    <p>The C–130’s would be provided on the following conditions:</p>
                    <p>—that we make it crystal clear to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> that this is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the first
                        step in anything. We are talking about three C–130’s and that’s all. We
                        would specifically rule out combat forces.</p>
                    <p>—that planes will be used only for the transport of men and material in
                        operations we think are soundly planned and have a reasonable prospect of
                        success.</p>
                    <p>—that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> will not execute
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, on pain of withdrawal
                        of our planes.</p>
                    <p>One further condition was left out of the State memorandum by mistake, but
                        will be enforced if you approve: that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> will stop seeming to lump the U.S. and Belgium under
                        the heading “Western white colonialists” in his public statements.</p>
                    <p>There are risks to this approach. We don’t know whether the mutiny is part of
                        an organized plot to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>. We don’t know whether or how it is related to the
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> incident. Most
                        important, we don’t know how well the regular Congolese troops will do
                        against these rough and ready freebooters. Even though the mercenaries are
                        small in number—apparently about 200—they are formidable military forces in
                        the Congo.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, it seems to me that these risks are outweighed by the benefits.
                        This move would be hailed by all the Africans, along with the other poor
                        countries and most of the industrialized world. (The Soviets are already
                        committed publicly against the mercenaries.) By quick action, we may be able
                        to avoid a painful, drawn-out conflict in the bush which could negate all
                        the progress made in the Congo over the past two years. And in doing so, we
                        could preempt large opportunities which this crisis could present for the
                        communists.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, I would vote that you approve the Secretary’s recommendation.</p>

                        to interdiction by rebel-controlled aircraft. The Ambassador would also make
                        clear to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> that the United
                        States is not prepared to make combat forces available to the Congo.<note n="2" xml:id="d508fn2">The approval line is checked, indicating the
                            recommendation was approved.</note></p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                    <p>On July 4, approximately 160 white Congolese mercenaries, largely French and
                        Belgian, leading 1,000–2,000 Katangese troops of the Congolese Army, seized
                        several towns in the northeast area of the Congo. These mercenaries,
                        originally recruited by <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, and
                        currently paid by the Congolese Government, are now obviously in a state of
                        mutiny. Apparently their actions were prompted either by a <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> plot to overthrow the Congolese
                        Government or by the kidnapping <pb n="743" facs="0776" xml:id="pg_743"/> of
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and by attempts of the
                        Congolese Government to extradite <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> from Algeria. It is not clear to what extent they
                        are receiving support from forces outside the Congo, although we suspect
                        they are backed by individual Belgians in financial and mining circles.</p>
                    <p>Although the present situation is extremely fluid, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> considers it a serious threat to
                        his regime. The mercenaries have a reputation of toughness, and the Congo
                        Army of about 20,000 is reluctant to engage them. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> believes that in order to defuse
                        the situation he must very quickly show he is able to take a
                        counteroffensive.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">To prepare for such a counterattack, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has asked the US Government for
                            three C–130 aircraft on an urgent basis to transport Congolese troops
                            and matériel within the interior</hi>. His present aircraft capability
                        is extremely limited. The eleven armed T–28’s we previously provided
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> are operational but the
                        pilots are mercenaries and <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                        seems unwilling to chance using them now. His transport fleet, consisting
                        largely of C–47’s, lacks sufficient maintenance and flying personnel; the
                        pilots include some Italian trained Congolese and some Belgian aircraft
                        crews on loan. Past experience has shown that the existing transport fleet
                        cannot provide the vehicle and personnel lift over long distances in the
                        Congo necessary to meet this need.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has requested African support
                        from every African state through the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>.
                        He feels it is politically impossible at the present time to ask for Belgian
                        military support although he has asked for and received assurances of
                        Belgian political support. He views the US as historically the only source
                        on which he can count.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has also requested an
                        immediate emergency session of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                        Security Council which is being held tonight.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet press has denounced the mutiny and the French and Belgian
                        Governments have announced their complete support of the <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> Government. We know of no
                        government taking sides with the mercenaries. If we should send C–130’s to
                        the Congo, we expect little if any difficulty with the Soviets as they could
                        not behave as if they supported <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> or European mercenaries. On the other hand if we let
                        the situation deteriorate without helping <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, we could expect the Soviets to try and take
                        advantage of the situation in unhelpful ways.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName> believes a quick
                        delivery could have a critical psychological effect in the Congo, both with
                        the central government which needs bucking up and as a deterrent to the
                        mutineers. He strongly recommends that we supply the aircraft.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Supplying the aircraft would have the following
                        advantages:</p>
                    <p>—US support for an African Government against an uprising led by white
                        mercenaries and supported by foreign right wing groups <pb n="744" facs="0777" xml:id="pg_744"/>would strengthen the US position among
                        Black African countries. Help for a Black African state would be
                        particularly timely now against the background of the Middle East
                        crisis.</p>
                    <p>—Quick symbolic action by the US could help prevent the situation from
                        growing out of hand by bolstering <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and deterring the mutineers.</p>
                    <p>—We helped the Congolese in 1964 by making available four C–130’s when they
                        faced the threat from the left. Assisting them now when they face a threat
                        from the right would be another demonstration of our even-handedness.</p>
                    <p>—US support would help to counter the Congolese racist feeling which is
                        mounting rapidly against white mercenaries and which may grow to include all
                        whites. It would enable us strongly to urge <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> to desist from anti-white propaganda, and propaganda
                        against us, the Belgians, and others as “imperialists”.</p>
                    <p>—US support would reassure <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                        that his pro-Western policy was correct and would enable him to keep from
                        turning in extremis to Arab states, such as Algeria or the <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss>, or other African states, who might be
                        willing to intervene.</p>
                    <p>—US support could make it easier for us to deal with the Security Council
                        situation where we might otherwise face a sweeping Congolese indictment of
                        “Western imperialism” or of individual Western countries. Our assistance
                        would give us leverage to persuade the Congolese to moderate their
                        claims.</p>
                    <p>—The availability of the C–130’s in the Congo would facilitate large scale
                        evacuation of Americans, should this become necessary.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Supplying the aircraft also involves certain
                        risks:</p>
                    <p>—There is danger in moving military equipment before we know precisely
                        whether there is a real need for it, how it would be used and the dangers to
                        which it will be exposed.</p>
                    <p>—We may be confronted with a follow-on request for U.S. combat troops if
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> judges the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> would not alone be able to defeat the
                        mercenaries.</p>
                    <p>—Even though the aircraft would be supplied at the request of the Congo
                        Government, our action could be viewed by some as unilateral US
                        intervention.</p>
                    <p>—Furnishing military transport planes might encourage future requests for
                        direct assistance from other countries in similar situations. (The
                        distinguishing characteristic here, however, is that foreign white
                        mercenaries are involved.)</p>
                    <p>—In helping <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> put down an
                        insurrection that is sympathetic to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, we recognize that an early extradition and
                        execution of <pb n="745" facs="0778" xml:id="pg_745"/><persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> will provoke strong adverse
                        reactions from his traditional supporters. If we comply with the request for
                        C–130’s we would use the opportunity to urge <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> strongly not to execute <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. We would make it clear that if the execution
                        occurred, we would be obliged to withdraw the planes.</p>

                    <p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>I have received your letter of July 5 about the situation in the Democratic
                        Republic of the Congo. I am consulting urgently with my advisers here to
                        determine how, within the limitations of our own resources, <pb n="746" facs="0779" xml:id="pg_746"/> we can help your government at this
                        difficult time. We shall communicate with you as soon as possible through my
                        Ambassador to the Congo, Robert <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName>. We are confident you will succeed in restoring
                        order and resuming the path on which you have already embarked toward
                        stabilization and progress in the Congo. The Congolese National Army, backed
                        by the Congolese people, acting together under your courageous leadership
                        will, I am sure, reestablish the calm necessary to that task.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW_1">Walt Rostow</persName> called me this date
                        and said that the President was mulling around in his mind whether or not he
                        should accede to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s request
                        for assistance in air transportation to move his troops around, and said the
                        President asked him to ask me the following three questions:</p>
                    <p>1. Does he need the equipment to move his troops around or not? I said it was
                        my understanding that he’s got in the neighborhood of 7 operational C–47s
                        over there which he could use to move them, except for the fact that he is
                        loath to trust his crews for fear they might defect. Mr. Rostow said that he
                        had the same information. I said that if there is a requirement to move
                        troops around and <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> is afraid
                        of his own crews because they might defect, the only way he could move his
                        troops would be to get some aircraft with crews he could trust, in which
                        case I would say he would need the C–130s.</p>
                    <p>2. Mr. Rostow then asked about the danger involved. I said of course there is
                        always danger involved in a situation as unsettled as that, when you don’t
                        know who has control. Also, there is always the danger of sabotage, and we
                        might be subject, of course, to actual combat and get the equipment or crews
                        shot up. I said, however, we went in there before to pull the refugees out
                        and we were fortunate <pb n="747" facs="0780" xml:id="pg_747"/>enough not to
                        suffer any casualties or damage to equipment, except normal operational
                        damage.</p>
                    <p>3. Mr. Rostow then said he had been told to ask me if the Ambassador would
                        have the competence to determine whether or not the fields that will have to
                        be operated out of are satisfactory for the use of this equipment and
                        whether or not they are secure. I said I couldn’t pass judgment on the
                        capabilities of the Ambassador in that respect, but that he does have an Air
                        Attaché there who, in my opinion, would certainly be qualified to determine
                        if the fields could handle the equipment and, given proper intelligence,
                        determine whether they are secure. He could then give the Ambassador
                        appropriate advice. I said I assumed if we sent aircraft we wouldn’t just
                        send pilots and crews, but would send a task force commander who would be
                        qualified.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow thanked me and that concluded the conversation.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>1. Belgian Position. We have asked the Belgians here and in Brussels for
                        further air crews for the Congo. They know that we have had a request for
                        C–130s and have agreed to delay replying to a Congolese request for matériel
                        assistance until they learn our reaction. Mr. <pb n="748" facs="0781" xml:id="pg_748"/>Rostow will discuss the subject again with the Belgian
                        Ambassador at 2:45 today.<note n="2" xml:id="d511fn2">Memcon will be LDX’d
                            to <gloss target="#t_WH_1">WH</gloss> as soon as it is completed. BHR.
                            [Handwritten footnote in the original.]</note> The Belgian position is a
                        bit shaky. The abduction of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        was badly received in some Belgian circles. More importantly, the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> is smarting under Congolese press and
                        radio attacks lumping the mutineers, many of whom are Belgians, with the
                        rest of the Belgian population of the Congo and with Belgian financial
                        interests. Brussels has said that Belgian air crews now in the Congo will
                        carry out <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> orders, that other Belgian
                        military personnel (training troops) will stand by, and that a request from
                        the Congo government for arms and munitions has been received. The Belgians
                        may act favorably on the latter request, if we provide assistance and if
                        Congo press attacks abate. However, their initial reaction indicates that
                        they would insist on a moderation of anti-Belgian propaganda as precondition
                        to such aid. Our Ambassador in the Congo is pointing out to the Congolese
                        the dangers of over-exciting the Congolese population. We have made the same
                        point to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> here. We
                        are keeping the Belgians informed of these actions.</p>
                    <p>We do not, in summary, expect the Belgian government to consider taking the
                        lead in providing assistance to the Congo until it is sure that the US is
                        ready to help and until it is sure that a wave of anti-Belgian and
                        anti-white propaganda in the Congo is brought under control and possible
                        incidents avoided. Internal political considerations in Belgium dictate this
                        cautious stand. Should there be an unprovoked slaughter of Belgians (and
                        such may have just occurred in Katanga) then the Belgians will pull back
                        from assistance.</p>
                    <p>2. Mercenary Objectives. Mercenaries in the Congo, even though in the pay of
                        the Congolese government, always represented a potential Trojan horse
                        because their political sympathies were essentially very conservative, even
                        colonialist, and often pro-<persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>.
                        No single leadership of the various groups has been clearly identified nor
                        has there apparently any public statement which could be attributed to the
                        rebels.</p>
                    <p>Embassy Kinshasa speculates that mercenary objectives may be to establish
                        control over the Eastern Congo as a base to channel in reinforcements and
                        eventually take over mineral-rich Katanga. Presumably they would welcome the
                        Congolese (or Katangan) leadership of someone like <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> or other pliable Congolese
                        elements willing to go along with them.</p>
                    <p>In the absence of further information it is uncertain exactly what the
                        mercenaries seek. It is perhaps significant that they have not used the
                        radios at Kisangani or Bukavu to broadcast their aims. However, as <pb n="749" facs="0782" xml:id="pg_749"/>the rebellion of 1964–65 showed, a
                        very few determined, well-trained and well-armed mercenaries can take over
                        large parts of the Congo and this is the threat that the <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> now faces.</p>
                    <p>The Belgians tell us that they are unsure what the exact motivations were.
                        They say it could have been part of a long-planned pro-<persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> plot, a sudden move to thwart the
                        extradition of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, or perhaps
                        only a dissatisfaction with lack of pay.</p>
                    <p>3. African Reaction. Zambia condemned the mercenary rebellion and offered
                        assistance. <persName corresp="#p_KKE_1">Kaunda</persName> said: “The Congo
                        aggression means there will be no peace for countries small in terms of
                        military might.” He congratulated the US and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> for condemning the mercenaries.</p>
                    <p>Rwanda has condemned the mercenaries, pledged support to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and opened the airport of Kamembe
                        to US aircraft for the evacuation of American citizens and to the Congo
                        Government, should it need it.</p>
                    <p>Congo (Brazzaville) has strongly castigated the mercenary actions and pledged
                        assistance, including troops if necessary, to help suppress the
                        rebellion.</p>
                    <p>The Nigerian Ambassador here has expressed the view of many of his colleagues
                        in strongly condemning the mercenaries. The Somalis and Ethiopians have told
                        us that they are horrified that foreign mercenaries are trying to disrupt
                        the unity of the Congo.</p>
                    <p>At the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, the non-permanent members of the
                        Security Council (including Ethiopia, Mali, and Nigeria) met Friday morning
                        and unanimously agreed to support the Congolese proposed resolution calling
                        on all countries to refrain from assistance to the mercenaries.<note n="3" xml:id="d511fn3">July 7. On July 6, the Congolese Representative asked
                            for an emergency meeting of the Security Council to consider the
                            question of aggression against the Congo on July 5.</note></p>
                    <p>4. Military Situation. For an as yet undertermined cause, dissident elements
                        which have held Bukavu for two days left the town in three columns on their
                        own volition early this morning and Congolese troops returned. There seems
                        to be some danger of anti-European acts by the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Despite <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> claims that an <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> paracommando unit dropped on Kisangani
                        early this morning, destroyed dissident-held T–28 aircraft, and occupied
                        most of the city, another more reliable report indicates that Kisangani
                        still is partly in mercenary hands and that the T–28s were not
                        destroyed.</p>
                    <p>The Congolese police report that Kindu radio went silent this morning, which
                        may mean that town is in rebel hands.</p>
                    <p>Anti-white tensions are reported high in Lubumbashi and we have just learned
                        that 13 Europeans were massacred by the army.</p>

                        Reaction. In Bill Macomber’s absence, Tully Torbert talked with Mr.
                        Stempler, <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> Legislative Liaison. Stempler
                        feels that neither <persName corresp="#p_RRB_1">Russell</persName> nor
                        Rivers would be enthusiastic about the return of the C–130’s to the Congo
                        but would go along if the move were explained in a clear, well considered
                        policy statement. In general, it would be important to have something to
                        show for the assistance, for example a better public posture by <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> toward white Westerners and/or a
                        deal on <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. Torbert defers to

                    <p>304. 1. I am acutely aware of difficult moral, human and public relations
                        position in which US Govt has been placed over Congolese C–130 request
                        because of repulsive brutality <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> in
                        Lubumbashi and excesses elsewhere. Incidentally, experience would indicate
                        first day or two <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> reoccupies a town are
                        most critically dangerous. Present situation is of course exacerbated by
                        fact that <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> is retaking towns (they may
                        simply have been evacuated) which were occupied by white mercenaries, so
                        situation would be critical even without Congolese Govt’s action in arousing
                        anti-white sentiment which, as reported, was less extreme over last night’s
                        television and radio; though this morning’s radio not good.</p>
                    <p>2. As of this moment there are no new elements in situation. Kisangani partly
                        in hands of <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> but this does not include
                        airport where apparently large group of Europeans have been gathered under
                        mercenary control. There is likewise nothing new from Lubumbashi. Fate of
                        rebellion itself is hazy in extreme. However, there little doubt that some
                        mercenary–Katangese bands remain in operation despite reports at least one
                        planeload of mercenaries and others has landed in Rhodesia.</p>
                    <p>3. I am now attempting to reach <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> to convey contents paras 2 and 3 Dept’s 3252<note n="2" xml:id="d513fn2">Dated July 7. (Ibid.)</note> but have not been
                        successful yet. I will of course not clarify to him all purposes for which
                        C–130s may be pre-positioned but simply indicate as Dept instructs that they
                        are being placed in readiness. Report about readiness of C–130s will not
                        satisfy <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> long and he will be
                        pressing to know when they might be available for his missions. I will
                        discuss in as non-inflammatory way as possible, question of their
                        availability in context his need take urgent measures all aspects of racial
                        situation. At same time, it must be realized that not making available
                        C–130s risks causing deterioration of Congolese will to take determinant
                        measures to improve position of European population. On other hand, I am
                        sincerely convinced arrival of C–130s will be kind of demonstration of
                        Western support which would help quickly settle down situation.</p>
                    <pb n="752" facs="0785" xml:id="pg_752"/>
                    <p>4. Finally, there are no new elements in evacuation situation since last
                        night and considerations about effective presence C–130s here on American
                        morale remain pertinent. Obviously, it is of course essential that Congolese
                        not know evacuation is a factor in our despatching planes to Congo and
                        indeed evacuation from areas controlled by <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> is a highly delicate factor in itself.<note n="3" xml:id="d513fn3">A copy of this telegram was transmitted to the

                    <p>3301. Eyes only for Ambassador from Secretary. You have been informed that as
                        a precautionary matter we have displaced three C–130s forward to Ascension.
                        I want to give you some feel of the problem back here which must be taken
                        into account in considering any final decisions about the forward movement
                        of these planes to the Congo. In my talks with Senate leaders great emphasis
                        has been placed once again on the question “who else is doing something
                        about it.” We have just been through a Middle Eastern crisis in which there
                        was passionate objection in our Congress to unilateral action by the United
                        States. This feeling runs very deep and is related to a chagrin that not
                        enough help is coming from others in Viet-Nam.</p>
                    <p>All this means that we should weigh very seriously indeed a forward movement
                        of these planes in the absence of tangible assistance from somewhere else.
                        This would be particularly important if the C–130s are to become involved in
                        ferrying <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> troops with the risks of
                        military incidents as distinct from being there for possible evacuation
                        purposes.</p>
                    <p>I am not at the moment prejudging the decision here because we will want to
                        take into fullest account your own most sober assessment <pb n="753" facs="0786" xml:id="pg_753"/>of the situation. But I am dubious about
                        committing aircraft for what might prove to be temporary psychological
                        reasons when we shall run into some quite severe psychological reactions
                        here. If the object is psychological, would one C–130 be as effective as
                        three? Any details with respect to operational use, duration of presence in
                        Congo, and possibility of publicly known assistance from other friendly
                        sources would be very helpful.</p>
                    <p>Much appreciate the job you are doing.<note n="2" xml:id="d514fn2">In

                            emphasized that the need was greater than ever because of press reports

                    <p>“Dear Mr. Minister:</p>
                    <p>Once again we are both confronted by difficult days in the Congo. I am taking
                        the liberty of sending you our thoughts, for as always I attach the highest
                        importance to consultation and cooperation between us. I am most
                        appreciative of assurances from Viscount <persName corresp="#p_DVE_1">Davignon</persName> to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KRB_1">Knight</persName> that you await these thoughts before replying to
                        President <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s request for
                        material assistance.</p>
                    <p>I agree fully with the concern of your government that some Congolese actions
                        and statements are creating a difficult and potentially dangerous situation
                        for foreign nationals in the Congo. We have reviewed <pb n="754" facs="0787" xml:id="pg_754"/> at the highest level the possible actions we might
                        take to counter this alarming trend and to bolster the Government of the
                        Congo as it traverses one of its most serious national crises and indeed
                        faces a threat to the Congo’s very existence as a nation. As you know we
                        have sent 3 C–130s to Ascension Island as a precautionary measure for
                        possible use in ferrying Congolese army troops and material. We have also
                        instructed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName> to

                        must end the provocative anti-white, anti-West turn in Congolese propaganda
                        and actions, an effort which I understand may already have had a beneficial
                        effect.</p>
                    <p>We are aware of the risks and of the significance of sending these aircraft
                        to the Congo but we urge you to make a similar gesture, perhaps the
                        furnishing of additional air-crews.</p>
                    <p>In my conversations on the Congo with various Senators during the past few
                        days I found passionate interest in what others were doing to help.
                        Specifically, the question was asked, ’why cannot the Belgians do more?’ If,
                        in fact, aircraft from outside the Congo are required to restore order and
                        racial peace, our ability to help would be deeply affected by the
                        willingness of others to take similar action.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_KRB_1">Knight</persName> expressed his concern
                            that the Congo, having turned down the Belgian offer of assistance,
                            might press its complaint against Belgium in the Security Council. He
                            pointed out that the mutiny in the Congo had been instigated by
                            mercenaries recruited largely by <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>. If the Belgian Representative were to bring this
                            out in the debate, however, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> would be infuriated, which could have grave
                            repercussions on the situation in the Congo. Therefore, <persName corresp="#p_KRB_1">Knight</persName> suggested that <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName> try to get <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> to avoid acrimonious charges
                            and counter-charges when the Council met again on July 10.

                    <p>1. Agree that we do not want acrimonious debate or unfounded allegations by

                        make this point to <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> so that
                        he can get appropriate instructions to <persName corresp="#p_ITH_1">Idzumbuir</persName> immediately.</p>
                    <p>2. Suggest that <gloss target="#t_USUN_1">USUN</gloss> see <persName corresp="#p_ITH_1">Idzumbuir</persName> soonest and give him briefing on

                        briefing on Belgian offer. If we can judge from past experience, Idzumbir
                        will probably not know of offer nor have knowledge that <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> has thanked <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> for offer. Briefing might deflect him a

                    </list>
                    <p>1. The President’s action followed a unanimous positive recommendation from
                        the Secretary of State, the U.S. Ambassador to the Congo (Robert <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName>), the Acting Secretary of Defense,
                        the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Director of Central Intelligence.</p>
                    <p>2. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName> recommended the
                        C–130’s after the most sober reflection. He cabled that he was “acutely
                        aware of the difficult moral, human, and public relations” problems
                        involved. But he recommended “that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s request be met on basis of extreme urgency on which
                        he has made it.” <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName>’s
                        reasons:</p>
                    <p>—“It is important in present most shaky state of Congolese Government to give
                        some specific symbol of support as we have in the past. It is difficult to
                        overestimate the urgency of this matter.”</p>
                    <p>—“Assistance from U.S. at this timely juncture would assist in
                        counterbalancing menacing racist feeling which is mounting. Understandably,
                        man in street is incensed at actions of foreign, white mercenaries against
                        his country, and this sentiment regrettably risks running to all whites.
                        Fact that U.S. assisted Congolese Government at this time could be a key
                        element in defusing this dangerous situation.”</p>
                    <p>—“It is important to assist <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                        now that he faces threat from right . . . since we helped Congolese when
                        they faced threat from left.” This would also be important “in the broader
                        African context.”</p>
                    <p>—“It would be most desirable to have C–130’s in event local situation
                        deteriorates and it is necessary to evacuate all Americans from Congo.”</p>
                    <pb n="759" facs="0792" xml:id="pg_759"/>
                    <p>—In the course of further urgings that the aircraft be sent (the first
                        recommendation was made July 6), <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName> commented that the C–130’s must be provided if the
                        rebellion were to be put down quickly and “the Congo is not to be set back
                        many years economically and psychologically.”</p>
                    <p>—As the racial problem worsened in the days before the C–130’s were
                        announced, <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName> cabled that “the
                        American colony, diplomatic and otherwise, in effect is being held hostage
                        in its entirety.”</p>
                    <p>3. All of the abovementioned advisers to the President supported <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName>’s position. In addition to his
                        arguments, they made the following points in a joint memorandum:</p>
                    <p>—“If we should send C–130’s to the Congo, we expect little if any difficulty
                        with the Soviets as they could not behave as if they supported <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> or European mercenaries. On the
                        other hand, if we let the situation deteriorate without helping <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, we could expect the Soviets to try
                        and take advantage of the situation.”</p>
                    <p>—“U.S. support would reassure <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                        that his pro-Western policy was correct and would enable him to keep from
                        turning in extremis to the Arab states, such as Algeria or the <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss>, or other African states, who might be
                        willing to intervene.”</p>
                    <p>—“U.S. support could make it easier for us to deal with the Security Council
                        situation where we might otherwise face a sweeping Congolese indictment of
                        ’Western Imperialism’ or of individual Western countries. Our assistance
                        would give us leverage to persuade the Congolese to moderate their
                        claims.”</p>
                    <p>—“Help for a Black African state would be particularly timely now against the
                        background of the Middle East crisis.” (The black Africans were heavily
                        pro-Arab.)</p>
                    <p>4. It is important to note what the action was and what it was not. It was a
                        favorable response to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s
                        request for long-range logistical support needed to transport his men and
                        matériel across a country nearly as large as India.</p>
                    <p>—It was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the supplying of combat forces. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> was specifically told that the U.S.
                        would <hi rend="italic">not</hi> supply combat troops. (The contingent of
                        paratroops which came with the planes is the normal security guard for the
                        aircraft, without which the <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> will not
                        send a plane to any danger spot in the world. They are there to protect the
                        aircraft and that is all.)</p>
                    <p>—It was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the first step in growing U.S. military
                        commitment. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> understands that
                        this is all we can do.</p>
                    <p>—It was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> an example of callous disregard for the
                        lives of our soldiers. The aircraft commanders have clear orders that the
                        ruling criterion <pb n="760" facs="0793" xml:id="pg_760"/> in any decision
                        about their use is to be the safety of our men and equipment.</p>
                    <p>—It was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> an indication that the U.S. intends to
                        leap into every internal problem in every African country. The Congo is a
                        special case. It is not a civil war, it is an uprising of foreign
                        mercenaries. The principle involved does not require us to get involved in
                        civil conflict elsewhere on the continent. (This is an oblique reply to the
                        charge that we must now move into the Nigerian problem. You may want to make
                            <hi rend="italic">private</hi> use of the fact that we turned down an
                        arms request from the Nigerian central government last week.)</p>
                    <p>5. One can make a decent case that the President’s action has already
                        provided us with one major accomplishment—the avoidance of major racial
                        violence on Sunday in Lubumbashi (formerly Elisabethville). The stage was
                        set for serious trouble on Saturday. With the help of the leverage provided
                        by the C–130 decision, we were able to get things quieted down. The lives of
                        100 Americans and 12,000 European whites were involved.</p>

                    <p>1. Contrary to ticker reports out of Brussels, no U.S. plane has flown to
                        Kisangani (formerly Stanleyville) to attempt to rescue hostages held by the
                        rebel mercenaries. Such an operation had been planned, but was scrubbed by
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> last night because of
                        the risks that the landing of our plane might stimulate or get our people
                        involved in a blood bath.</p>
                    <pb n="761" facs="0794" xml:id="pg_761"/>
                    <p>2. We have queried <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName> about: (i)
                        paratrooping a single negotiator (perhaps an American) into Kisangani to try
                        to work out an evacuation deal with the mercenaries, and (ii) if successful,
                        bussing the hostages 40 miles to an airport the Congolese army controls and
                        where our aircraft could land safely.</p>
                    <p>3. We have made a strong pitch to the International Red Cross to take over
                        the hostage problem. They are now deliberating. We are giving them all the
                        communication and transport help we can. You should know, however, that our
                        African experience with this organization is not encouraging.</p>
                    <p>4. The Secretary is now considering two further moves:</p>
                    <p>—a <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>-ordered and highly
                        publicized mercy drop of food and supplies to Kisangani.</p>
                    <p>—an approach to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> to suggest a
                        private offer of a deal to the mercenaries for their immediate departure
                        from the Congo in return for a safe passage.</p>
                    <p>5. We still have no hard information on the situation in Kisangani. The
                        mercenaries remain in control of at least the airport and perhaps the city.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has not ordered the
                        Congolese army to advance on the airport, but has indicated that he will
                        have to do so soon.</p>
                    <p>6. As you know, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> will
                        appear at a closed session of the Foreign Relations Committee this
                        afternoon. We are trying to do some ground work on the Hill; <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Wayne Fredericks</persName> has already talked to
                        Senators Moss and Muskie, who have been friendly to our Congo policy, as
                        well as Representatives Brademas, Adair, and others.</p>
                    <p>7. An additional thought which has occurred to us is that the Vice President
                        has in the past been a solid and effective advocate of the Congo policy. If
                        it is agreeable to you, it might do some good if he could make some phone
                        calls. I will await your guidance on this one.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>1. Our C–130’s flew two missions yesterday, dropping ammunition and supplies
                        to Congolese forces.</p>
                    <p>2. At 10:00 A.M. today, our time, a C–130 left Kinshasa on the first of the
                        humanitarian missions you discussed with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName>. This one is carrying 6 tons of
                            <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> foodstuffs to Bukavu. It will stop
                        at racially-tense Lubumbashi (formerly Elisabethville) on the way back to
                        buck up the frightened white community. Other such missions are in the
                        works.</p>
                    <p>3. The situation in Kisangani (formerly Stanleyville) remains unchanged. We
                        have been wracking our brains to think of a way to start negotiations with
                        the mercenaries to free the hostages. The present plan is to send a
                        clearly-marked Red Cross plane, flown by Swiss Red Cross personnel who have
                        been designated International Red Cross representatives. The plane would
                        approach Kisangani, try to raise the mercenaries on the radio and proceed to
                        land whether or not the mercenaries had given their clearance. We have
                            <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> authorization, and the mission
                        will probably be flown tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>4. The Red Cross mission will use a non-U.S. plane. If it works, however, we
                        can expect a request to use the larger U.S. aircraft to make the actual
                        evacuations.</p>
                    <p>5. We have a third-hand report this morning that the mercenaries may be
                        trying to get word to us that they would allow an evacuation of the
                        hostages. This is only a fragmentary report of a Congolese contact with an
                        unidentified aircraft which had passed over Kisangani. However, we will
                        follow it up.</p>
                    <p>6. We may get trouble on the Hill today because of an A.P. ticker item this
                        morning (A.P.–3) quoting the Congolese Minister of the Interior that there
                        have been instances of Congolese cannibalism of whites in Lubumbashi. This
                        is the Minister whom <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has sent
                        on a grand tour of the Congo to quiet down racial fears. It is most unlikely
                        that he would have said this, particularly since we have no indication from
                        our excellent consul in Lubumbashi that any such thing has occurred. The <pb n="763" facs="0796" xml:id="pg_763"/>Congolese Embassy in Paris has
                        already issued denial that the Minister said anything of the kind. We have
                        sent a flash inquiry to our people in the places involved.</p>
                    <p>7. Our best guess is that what the Minister of the Interior really did was to
                        refer to the bayoneting of 8 Europeans last week. That incident is known to
                        the press, and things have been pretty quiet in Lubumbashi since. Of course,
                        neither of these fine points will keep our brethren on the Hill from using
                        this news against us.</p>
                    <p>8. The list of other countries helping <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> is growing slowly. Ethiopia has promised some jet
                        fighters; Ghana will send pilots and crews; and Guinea has offered to send
                        12 MIGs. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> is wrestling with
                        the Guinean offer because of <persName corresp="#p_TSE_1">Sekou
                            Toure</persName>’s strong leftward leanings and possible trouble with
                        the other Africans if he accepts.</p>

                    <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has reported to <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName> that the mercenaries in Kisangani
                        (formerly Stanleyville) fled the city by truck convoy at noon today our
                        time. Destination unknown.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName> has refused <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s suggestion that we supply a C–130
                        for reconnaissance to find out where the mercenaries are going. Congolese
                        planes can and should do this job.</p>
                    <p>3. The Red Cross mission to Kisangani is now fully set up and will leave at
                        10:00 tonight our time. We have no word on what happened to the hostages
                        when the mercenaries fled. If they were unharmed, the job of the Red Cross
                        plane will be to forestall any Congolese excesses as the Congolese army
                        occupies the city.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName> has made a strong démarche
                        to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> that a great deal depends
                        on his ability to keep his soldiers from harming the white <pb n="764" facs="0797" xml:id="pg_764"/>population in Kisangani and other cities.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has responded with a
                        radio announcement that restrictions on travel by foreigners, curfews, and
                        other measures directed against the white community will be lifted
                        tonight.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName> has worked up several more
                        proposed mercy mis-sions for the C–130’s in addition to the food flight now
                        on the way to Bukavu. The first would be another food delivery to the
                        Kisangani area tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>6. All C–130 missions not required for emergency protection of Americans must

                    <p rend="center">NOTES OF THE PRESIDENT’S MEETING WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY
                        COUNCIL STAFF</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion of unrelated subjects.]</p>
                    <p>On matters affecting the Congo, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB_1">Katzenbach</persName> reported:</p>
                    <p>—There is no local competence.</p>
                    <p>—Despite this Communist influence, U.S. policy has been successful.</p>
                    <p>—There is no alternative to the current government. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> is “the end of the line.” There is
                        no better alternative.</p>
                    <p>—Since World Way II there has been considerable evidence that the U.S. will
                        not intervene against whites. We did recently, supporting <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> against the white mercenaries.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNB_1">Katzenbach</persName> said he thought this
                        would have a substantial pay-off in Africa.</p>
                    <p>—The Secretary reported a Red Cross Plane (C–130) was bringing out a mixture
                        of Congolese soldiers and white Americans.</p>
                    <p>—The use of the U.S. aircraft is important in protecting and rescuing the
                        whites who are in danger.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WEG_1">Wheeler</persName> reported to the
                        President on the military aspects of the Congolese operation. His report
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>—Today’s airlift was a diversion of a communications plane.</p>
                    <pb n="765" facs="0798" xml:id="pg_765"/>
                    <p>—There were no mercenaries found in the town according to a report received
                        at 6 a.m. today.</p>
                    <p>—There were 300 wounded refugees and hostages, including some Americans.</p>
                    <p>—The mercenaries had taken off with 27 truck loads including 300 troops and
                        an unconfirmed report of 20 American women held as hostages.</p>
                    <p>—<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has asked for U.S. air
                        surveillance to try to find the units. For the time being, the government
                        was asked to use its own planes by the U.S. Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>—The President asked for a full report on this situation, particularly how
                        many women hostages were being held, from <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> Director <persName corresp="#p_HRI_1">Richard
                            Helms</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_HRI_1">Helms</persName> said he
                        would get the report to the President as soon as prepared.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked for an appraisal of the political situation on
                        Capitol Hill in relation to U.S. actions in the Congo. The President said he
                        believed that the Administration had lost some good will, particularly with
                        the Foreign Relations Committee in the Senate.</p>
                    <p>He asked, was it true that the House Foreign Relations Committee had
                        applauded Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> when the
                        Secretary testified before that committee yesterday. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB_1">Katzenbach</persName> said that was true.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB_1">Katzenbach</persName> said there seems
                        to be a lack of understanding of the Congolese situation by Congressional
                        members. He said some of the criticism has been a result of racial prejudice
                        and a hesitancy to get into any action anywhere in the world because of what
                        is happening in Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>The President said that a general effort should be made to keep the Congress
                        better advised on anticipated actions.</p>

                    <p>984. 1. I am restricting distribution on this message since it ventures into
                        realm of prognostication, which is always risky in the Congo.</p>
                    <p>2. It seems to me that present rebellion falls into three phases. First phase
                        of course ended with mercenary seizure of Bukavu and Kisangani, which gave
                        rise to almost hysteria against foreign elements in Congo. Most extreme
                        danger of this phase was mitigated with US announcement of assistance to
                        Congo. While tension remained high, this decision was a watershed. Shortly
                        thereafter, restrictions against foreigners were terminated. This phase of
                        course ended with mercenary evacuation of Kisangani.</p>
                    <pb n="767" facs="0800" xml:id="pg_767"/>
                    <p>3. Second phase was local Congolese reaction against mercenary actions which
                        resulted in unbearable tension in Kisangani following its occupation by
                            <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> which resulted in necessity
                        evacuating virtually all foreigners. Although Congolese cooperation has been
                        spotty, this morning situation looks promising that Red Cross planes and
                        C–130 will complete evacuation with full Congolese assistance. This will
                        terminate second phase.</p>
                    <p>4. We then pass into obvious third phase which will be Congolese effort to
                        strangle mercenaries who are apparently holed up in Punia area. We cannot
                        predict how long this period will last but some experts feel logistic
                        problems will bring end one way or another to mercenary activity within a
                        couple of weeks. Others of course feel it will take longer. In any event,
                        this phase will probably see <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                        adopt tactics of attrition rather than attempting any direct attacks on
                        mercenaries. With any luck it should be considerably less hysterical than
                        situation up to now, and permit <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> gradually begin to work this country back onto its
                        flimsy tracks. His message to his countrymen on TV today is start of this
                        process.</p>
                    <p>5. Purpose of speculation in para above is background for consideration when
                        we should schedule departure C–130s. If Kisangani evacuation completed today
                        successfully, I would like Dept to consider if I should not on Monday seek
                        appointment with <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and lead
                        into question of departure C–130s. This may of course be extremely sticky
                        but I could point to new and improved situation. Perhaps Dept can furnish
                        other reasons that could be used to justify departure of planes perhaps on
                        some date in about 10 or 12 days. <gloss target="#t_JTF_1">JTF</gloss>

                        by middle of next week most supplies and men needing long-range transport
                        will be positioned as Congolese want them. Congolese own capabilities should
                        be able to take over thereafter.</p>
                    <p>6. I would be eager to have Dept’s view on this subject and instruction upon

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Steps Taken</p>
                    <p>—Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName> was instructed
                            Sunday<note n="2" xml:id="d526fn2">July 16.</note> to arrange with
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> for the departure of the
                        C–130s on July 24th—two weeks after the planes’ arrival on July 10th. (See
                        Tab A for details.)<note n="3" xml:id="d526fn3">The tabs are attached but
                            not printed.</note></p>
                    <p>—<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> reacted strongly and
                        negatively, stating that the planes should stay for one month (his original
                        request). (See Tab B for details.)</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion</p>
                    <p>—The original tasks of the C–130s are largely done: the intense anti-white
                        feeling in the Congo has abated; Kisangani has been evacuated; Congolese
                        Army forces and logistics support are being positioned to contain the
                        mercenary threat.</p>
                    <p>—The Congo has adequate air transport resources (C–46s, C–47s, and C–54s) in
                        the Congolese Air Force, Air Congo, and other commercial air activities. The
                        Congolese Air Force aircraft are grounded, however, since they were manned
                        by Belgian crews which were expelled by <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> on grounds of conspiring with the mercenaries. (See
                        Tab C for list of available aircraft and crews.)</p>
                    <p>—There are two probable consequences if <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> continues to force out Belgian military assistance:
                        (1) he will turn to the U.S. to fill the gap; and (2) he will feed the fears
                        of the European population (largely Belgian) who are vital to the Congo’s
                        economy.</p>
                    <p>—The foregoing points argue for the immediate or early withdrawal of the
                        C–130s. However, there are several points to consider on the other side.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> is not completely
                        rational on the subject of C–130s. He views them as tangible evidence of US
                        support. He could well react emotionally and unpredictably if he felt that
                        the withdrawal of the C–130s meant that the U.S. was withdrawing its
                        support. It is not inconceivable that he would lash out by whipping up again
                        anti-white reaction in the Congo. Just as conceivably, he could decide to
                        cast his <pb n="769" facs="0802" xml:id="pg_769"/>lot with the radical
                        Africans (and their Communist supporters) and turn to Algeria and East
                        Europeans for support.<note n="4" xml:id="d526fn4">A handwritten notation in
                            the margin reads: “I doubt this. T. Hoopes.”</note></p>
                    <p>—There are several options we should consider.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Option 1</hi>— Withdrawal of all three C–130s on July 24th
                        (our original deadline).</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Option 2</hi>— Withdrawal of all three C–130s on August 7th
                        (giving <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> his month).</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Option 3</hi>— Withdrawing one C–130 on July 24th, and one
                        C–130 each succeeding week (or withdraw both remaining C–130s simultaneously
                        during the second two-week period).</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Option 3</hi> probably gives us the best chance to start
                        withdrawing the C–130s without engendering a violent reaction by <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>.<note n="5" xml:id="d526fn5">The

                            remained until December 10.</note></p>
                    <p>—Regardless of which option is chosen, we should press <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> not to foreclose Belgian military
                        assistance (which he will need over the long term) and to assure the safety
                        (and hence continued presence) of the European population which is essential
                        to the Congo’s economic future.</p>

                    <p>9612. For Ambassador from Secretary.</p>
                    <p>1. We see an acute political problem arising here in US if <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> executes <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. It could affect adversely
                        Congressional reaction to our entire African assistance program and, more
                        specifically, might force revision of our aid policy to Congo, which has
                        been its mainstay since independence. As you know, aid program already in
                        deep trouble as result Middle East, Nigeria and other problems.</p>
                    <p>2. With Algiers indication that Supreme Court will hand down its decision on
                        Congo demand for <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> extradition
                        this Friday<note n="2" xml:id="d528fn2">July 21.</note> and Congo statements
                        that no further trial needed in Congo as <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> already found guilty, time is pressing in.</p>
                    <p>3. I know that it will be most difficult for you to approach <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> on this matter, that he may deeply
                        resent your raising subject and that the close working relationship you have
                        so quickly worked out with him could be seriously jeopardized. Nevertheless
                        I believe that we must have record clear with him and he know that the
                        execution of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> will have a
                        strong, adverse political effect here in US.</p>
                    <p>4. I know that you will have to tailor approach to him as you see fit but
                        believe following are points which could enter into your presentation. You
                        should make it plain that you are doing this under instructions:</p>
                    <p>a. US has no desire interfere with Congo’s judicial processes nor in its
                        internal affairs.</p>
                    <p>b. US has no brief for <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> and
                        understands Congo’s desire to end his plotting against govt of Congo.
                        Reaction US public opinion, <pb n="771" facs="0804" xml:id="pg_771"/>however
                        severe it might be, is not aimed especially at the Congo or this particular
                        case, but derives from a strong aversion to politics by violence. Political
                        exile and political asylum are deeply entrenched in the thinking of a nation
                        with our historic background. The difference between exile or imprisonment
                        on the one side and summary execution on the other is a very important
                        distinction.</p>
                    <p>c. US continues to support the govt as evidenced by its prompt reply to
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s request for assistance
                        in meeting the threat of mercenary mutiny, an action taken by the US despite
                        the political problems it caused for the Administration.</p>
                    <p>d. US is concerned however that summary execution of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, following on Pentecost hangings
                        of 1966, will evoke serious adverse political effect in US and thereby
                        seriously threaten steady support US has been able to give Congo since
                        independence.</p>
                    <p>e. US therefore strongly urges <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                        that, if <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> extradited, he not
                        carry out any planned execution and thus avoid arousing political protests
                        in US and elsewhere which would damage good name of Congo on international
                        scene.</p>
                    <p>f. Forbearance on this issue, while politically difficult in Congo, could
                        confound <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s and our critics
                        and enable <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> to capitalize on
                        stature gained as result of monetary reform and skillful leadership during
                        crisis caused by mercenaries.</p>
                    <p>5. Since we cannot be sure <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        may not be transferred to Kinshasa even before Algiers announcement, you
                        should act on this message soonest.<note n="3" xml:id="d528fn3">In telegram

                    <p>1741. For the Secretary from <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName>:</p>
                    <p>1. I will in separate message be making certain specific recommendations
                        about possibilities for US actions in Congo now. Purpose of this message to
                        you is unfortunately to signal what appears to be failure of local military
                        situation to improve, partially it must be frankly stated, due to failure of
                        Congolese to cope with their operational problems. I hate to add gloom but
                        facts must be faced. While C–130 mission has achieved its immediate purpose
                        of assisting <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> psychologically
                        and materially, in calming dangerous racist situation and presence in case
                        of need for total US evacuation, it must be faced that original problems
                        have not gone away. Second issue of anti-white sentiment is dormant for
                        moment but could flare up again. One possibility would be return of
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>, his execution followed
                        by outcry in US and Europe (and in part of Africa) followed by anti-foreign
                        outbursts here that would be more serious than events of early July. Insofar
                        as crushing mercenary rebellion is concerned, little progress has been made.
                        C–130s have efficiently transported matériel and men to periphery of area
                        affected, but there is no evidence <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>, in
                        part for lack of air cover, dares yet to tangle with mercenaries. On
                        contrary, Consulate Bukavu reports panic conditions there in <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> when mercenaries made a couple of distant
                        feints two days ago. It is apparent that all of help <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> has received has not converted its
                        officers or men into force that puts its back into anything with relish
                        except looting and beating civilians. Old hands here insist, however, there
                        is some improvement in that <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> did fight
                        mercenaries for a while in Kisangani, though other reports are
                        discouraging.</p>
                    <p>2. Worst we fear is that second C–130 and even third will depart without any
                        improvement in military situation. Then the irrational man with whom we are
                        dealing will, far from showing gratitude, turn on us. In state of
                        near-hysteria in which <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> finds
                        himself, this is real possibility. Simplest solution by far locally would be
                        maintenance of two C–130s until back of mercenary rebellion is broken, but
                        since this may be long-term matter and knowing problems at home, I have
                        refrained from recommending this as I did not want to pose this again. A
                        single C–130 would have some effect militarily and considerable effect <pb n="773" facs="0806" xml:id="pg_773"/>psychologically, and I would of
                        course like to retain one if this were possible, but I fear even this poses
                        grave difficulties for Department.</p>
                    <p>3. Despite all this, I am still genuinely concerned at immediate prospect of
                        C–130 departure and we have been seeking some way mitigate this problem.
                        These detailed thoughts will be contained in a separate message, but I just
                        wanted to point out that despite efforts on our part, Congolese have not
                        overcome their inability to utilize what assets they have. Their
                        hand-wringing and tendency to panic are chronic. By far the, easiest course
                        would be to wash our hands of this country. But this would of course be
                        basic reversal of our policy to assist present Congolese Govt in its slow
                        progress towards stability which unfortunately has been severely shaken by
                        this latest outbreak—though it must be admitted this one is not of Congolese
                        making. Furthermore, no alternative to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> appears on horizon and he still in spite of
                        everything seems our best bet as pro-Western Congolese leader. It is with
                        conviction in mind that basic policy should not be reversed that we are
                        recommending separately a series of possible courses of action, some of them
                        controversial and some ramshackle, but the best we can devise bearing
                        Washington problems in mind.</p>

                    <p>14267. For Ambassador from Secretary.</p>
                    <p>1. I have read your recent cables with close attention and understanding of
                        the problems you face. In turn you know how difficult the situation is
                        here.</p>
                    <p>2. The President has just received a letter from 18 Republican Senators,
                        including Senators <persName corresp="#p_HBB_1">Hickenlooper</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_DEM_1">Dirksen</persName>, protesting our action
                        in the Congo. The pressures to have the C–130s return have not abated.</p>
                    <p>3. I do not see how we can carry the entire burden in the Congo without some
                        effective assistance from others, especially those European <pb n="774" facs="0807" xml:id="pg_774"/> powers whose direct interests in the Congo
                        are far larger than our own. You will note my preoccupations in the letter I
                        have just sent to <persName corresp="#p_HPI_1">Harmel</persName><note n="2" xml:id="d530fn2">The Secretary’s message to <persName corresp="#p_HPI_1">Harmel</persName> was transmitted in telegram 14255 to Brussels,
                            July 29. (Ibid.)</note> and in the cables we are sending to certain
                        European capitals. The aim of all these is to seek a greater acceptance of
                        responsibility for assistance in the Congo; failing these efforts, I do not
                        see how we can continue.</p>
                    <p>4. I have asked that orders go forth putting off the Monday<note n="3" xml:id="d530fn3">July 31.</note> departure date for the C–130. We are
                        only thinking of a 24 to 48 hour delay to permit us to get a reading of what
                        others may do. You should not anticipate any substantial delay.</p>
                    <p>5. I consider it essential for you to condition the Congolese this weekend to
                        the withdrawal of the second C–130 early in the week. I am sure that you
                        will also pass on to them our own preoccupations and problems. You should
                        urge them in the strongest way possible to broaden their search for support
                        elsewhere in Western Europe as in Africa, making it plain that the US cannot
                        carry burden virtually alone.<note n="4" xml:id="d530fn4">In telegram 1786
                            from Kinshasa, July 30, <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName>
                            reported that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> reacted
                            calmly when he informed him that the second C–130 would be leaving in a
                            day or two, and that the final one would probably follow some days
                            later. The telegram expressed the Ambassador’s regrets that the C–130
                            issue had been such a source of anguish to the Department, but he
                            emphasized that the presence of the C–130s had been invaluable locally.

                    <p>2066. 1. I just talked to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and
                        told him he was enormously complicating task of US in aiding Congo by
                        permitting anti-American broadcasts. He said hastily he had just given order
                        to High Commissioner for information to withdraw offending broadcasts.</p>
                    <pb n="775" facs="0808" xml:id="pg_775"/>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> then asked again for C–130
                        mission to east and I said I would see what could be done. It is conceivable
                        that we could undertake mission to Goma tomorrow as reports from there
                        indicate all quiet.</p>
                    <p>3. Bukavu situation however obviously reaching crisis and I suppose it will
                        be impossible to recommend mission there though <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> strongly urges it on ground there is no danger
                        because airport is in Rwanda.</p>
                    <p>4. During same conversation I reported to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> C–46 had sighted 41 trucks heading towards Bukavu
                        approximately 40 miles from city. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> was grateful for this piece of intelligence.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> did not sound agitated over
                        telephone and perhaps he may be having second thoughts about wisdom of
                        provoking us, but it is too early to say. I believe this tempest might be
                        calmed definitively if we offered a run or two to Goma. On other hand if
                        mercenaries cross into Rwanda, revolt might be over though probably not in
                        manner <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> intended.<note n="2" xml:id="d531fn2">Telegram 16755 to Kinshasa, August 5, stated that the

                            August 9, reported that Bontemps, a friend of mercenary leader Major
                            Jean Schramme, warned that the mercenaries had the capability to wreak
                            havoc in the eastern Congo indefinitely if <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> refused to negotiate. Bontemps said that he knew
                            the mercenaries’ demands: safe departure via Rwanda to Europe and the
                            guaranteed safety of the North Katangan troops who had joined the
                            rebellion, either abroad or in Katanga. He offered to put these on a
                            paper for Schramme’s signature. The Consulate asked permission to accept
                            Schramme’s demands and pass them to the Embassy in Kinshasa for
                            transmission to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>.
                            (Ibid.)</note></p>
                    <p>1. Believe you should do everything possible discourage Bontemps, Shyns or
                        any others from thinking US could be channel for any Schramme proposals to
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> or <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>2. Not only is this unacceptable political risk for US position in Congo but
                        also, we believe, unrealistic to expect <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> show any receptivity to such proposal at this
                        time.</p>
                    <p>3. We assume that it equally impossible for <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> to be channel for proposal. If Kinshasa believes there is
                        some value in getting these proposals to <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> we would welcome any suggestions it may have. Our initial
                        impression is that only present possibility might be private person who has

                    <p>2. According to <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> concurs with his interpretation of
                        Congolese request contained in message to President of <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss>, i.e. that such assistance should be given
                        upon the specific request of <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> informed <gloss target="#t_Deptoff_1">Deptoff</gloss> after call on <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> that at first <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> did not seem averse to assistance
                        from <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> until <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> reminded him of past history <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>-Congolese relations. End <gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>3. At <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s request, <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> raised <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> matter. <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> explained serious concern in US about legal and
                        humanitarian principles as well as manner in which <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName> apprehended. He went on to say
                        that summary execution of <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>
                        would cause serious problem in US-<gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> defended Govt point of view
                        but <gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss> in subsequent conversation with
                            <gloss target="#t_Deptoff_1">Deptoff</gloss> indicated his unhappiness

                        although he did not hide his anathema for <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>. End <gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> had stated that primary problem was
                        to get rid of mercenaries. <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName>
                        agreed, stating that if they could be gotten rid by means other than force
                        present problem would be well on way to solution. <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> indicated his agreement.</p>
                    <p>6. Hope you able elicit similar interpretation <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> request contained in letter to <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> president so that there is no ambiguity on this point.</p>

                            Belgian Ambassadors would be arrested the next day. Bihin later called

                    <p>1. Appreciate what you have already done but believe there might be
                        additional effect if you called <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, even at this hour, to tell him you under
                        instructions to inform him of following:</p>
                    <p>A. Kind of demonstration reported reftel would be most difficult explain
                        outside Congo. Arrest of diplomatic chiefs of mission would not only be
                        violation diplomatic usage but would also demonstrate that <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> unable differentiate between Governments
                        concerned and acts of their citizens. To arrest chiefs of mission is very
                        serious step.</p>
                    <p>B. Such action appears be contradictory to mission we understand Litho has
                        just undertaken in Katanga. It could effectively nullify progress made in
                        assuring European technicians that their presence and contribution desired
                        in Congo.</p>
                    <p>C. We have not received message regarding Soviet offer but kind of action
                        reported reftel is bound to alienate sources of assistance, including US,
                        which have been most effective in past in helping Congo. Our considered
                        opinion is that lashing out at Belgians and others does not serve help
                        situation but only exacerbate it.<note n="3" xml:id="d538fn3">In telegram
                            2505 from Kinshasa, August 14, <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName> reported that <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> informed him of his August 13 talk in Kinshasa
                            with the Soviet Ambassador to the Congo (Brazzaville), who had said he
                            was responding to the Congolese appeal at the United Nations and asked
                            what kind of support the Congolese Government wanted. (Ibid., DEF 19–6

                    <p>20600. 1. In view series of events last few days, believe it most important
                        that you seek appointment with <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> ASAP and speak to him along following lines:</p>
                    <p>2. Under instructions you requesting clarification Congolese intentions for
                        immediate future.</p>
                    <p>3. We aware of discussions which <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> had held with Belgian <gloss target="#t_Amb_1">Amb</gloss> about security Belgian citizens and also of Litho efforts
                        calm foreign population Katanga. Therefore we find violence which took place
                        Kinshasa Aug 14<note n="2" xml:id="d539fn2">On August 14, the Belgian
                            Embassy was sacked and many Europeans and Americans in Kinshasa were
                            attacked and beaten.</note> inconsistent with <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>’s own assurances of safety for foreigners and with what we
                        considered to be sincere Belgo-Congolese efforts to find mutually acceptable
                        formula re security Belgian citizens in Congo. It seems to us that incident
                        of Aug 14 in large part due to inflammatory output Govt-controlled
                        communications media.</p>
                    <p>4. We also concerned by Congolese appeal to President <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> which, contrary to our usual frank and full discussions, was
                        carried out without prior knowledge <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>. We
                        struck by fact that at very time <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> under instructions to inform <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> of this step Soviet <gloss target="#t_Amb_1">Amb</gloss> in
                        Brazzaville appeared in Kinshasa to offer assistance in response to it.</p>
                    <p>5. More than any Congolese leader <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> is aware of US policy toward Congo and assistance US
                        has provided Congo. We have worked closely together for seven years.
                        Therefore we at loss to explain recent Congolese actions especially since
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> also aware strong
                        domestic reaction which our most recent assistance has caused in U.S.</p>
                    <p>6. Violence of Aug 14 in which American citizens were badly beaten,
                        especially if combined with assistance from Soviet or other countries backed
                        by Soviets, bound have adverse results in U.S.</p>
                    <p>7. US policy toward Congo remains unchanged but in view our close and cordial
                        relationships we would welcome <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s comments on above.</p>

                    <p>1. As you know, the Congolese Foreign Minister seemed on the verge yesterday
                        of working out a scheme with Schramme whereby the mercenaries would
                        “surrender” and be evacuated from the Congo via Rwanda.<note n="2" xml:id="d540fn2">Telegram 22134 to Kigali, August 17, instructed the
                            Ambassador to Rwanda, <persName corresp="#p_CLG_1">Leo G.
                            Cyr</persName>, to deliver a note to <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName>, who was in Kigali attempting to negotiate the
                            departure of the mercenaries through Rwanda, stating that the U.S.
                            Government was prepared to cooperate as appropriate to facilitate the
                            peaceful withdrawal to Rwanda and the safe and voluntary repatriation or
                            resettlement of certain foreign and Congolese elements. <persName corresp="#p_CLG_1">Cyr</persName> was told to make it clear to
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> that the U.S.
                            Government could not guarantee the security of persons who were not U.S.
                            nationals and not under U.S. control, and that neither the note nor U.S.
                            cooperation involved a financial commitment. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1967–69, POL 23–9 THE
                            CONGO)</note></p>
                    <p>2. Last night, however, after listening for hours to the mercenary radio
                        inciting Congolese troops to desert, the Foreign Minister told our people he
                        couldn’t go through with the plan without some dramatic move against the
                        mercenaries first. Without some show of government strength, he said, the
                        effects of public announcement of a negotiated settlement would be
                        disastrous for Congolese army morale, and perhaps even threaten <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s future as President.</p>
                    <p>3. Specifically, the Foreign Minister proposed to give Schramme an ultimatum:
                        give up within 48 hours or the town of Bukavu (where Schramme is
                        headquartered) will be “razed to the ground” by Congolese bombs. If the
                        bluff were called, he would carry out the raids with Ethiopian F–86’s based
                        in the neighboring country of Burundi.</p>

                    <p>4. Our people went at him hard to show him the lunacy of this course. We
                        pointed out that (i) it would probably destroy the Congo’s last chance to
                        end the mercenary problem with minimum political disruption and loss of
                        life, and (ii) the threat would be incredible and probably impossible for

                        best they could do would be rockets, and God knows whom they would hit. More
                        important, the airfield in Burundi is under repair and there is no F–86 fuel

                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName> also went to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> (more than 1000 miles away, in
                        Kinshasa) and asked him to instruct his Foreign Minister to stop the
                        nonsense and get back to working out the settlement. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> complied.</p>
                    <p>6. By the time <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s instructions
                        arrived this morning, however, the Foreign Minister had left for Burundi,
                        presumably to investigate for himself whether his plan is feasible and
                        whether the Burundians will allow themselves to be implicated in such an
                        operation. Our man in Burundi will try to intercept him and talk some sense
                        into him, as well as relaying <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s instructions.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KGR_1">Kayibanda</persName>; dated August 19,
                        1967:</p>
                    <p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>It was a great pleasure to see you during your recent visit to
                            Washington<note n="2" xml:id="d541fn2">President <persName corresp="#p_KGR_1">Kayibanda</persName> was in the United States
                            August 13–14. He met informally with President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> at the White House on August
                            14.</note> and I deeply valued the opportunity to exchange views with
                        you on a number of subjects of importance to our two countries.</p>
                    <p>I am prompted to write you at this time because of our mutual concern about
                        the situation in the Congo and our common interest in seeing an early end to
                        the mercenary-led rebellion.</p>
                    <pb n="785" facs="0818" xml:id="pg_785"/>
                    <p>I have viewed with considerable hope the Congolese plan to permit the
                        withdrawal of the mercenaries and Katangans to Rwanda, the evacuation of the
                        mercenaries out of Africa and the eventual voluntary repatriation of the
                        Katangans. I believe this plan is eminently designed to meet the objective
                        which you and we both seek and we have therefore given it our full
                        support.</p>
                    <p>If the plan can be successfully carried out, it would eliminate the mercenary
                        presence, end the specter of further bloodshed and permit the resumption of
                        normal activity in the Congo. Most important to you is that an unsettling
                        situation on your border will be ended. We are convinced that if the
                        rebellion is not ended as quickly as possible, the future effects in both
                        Rwanda and the Congo could be very serious.</p>
                    <p>The United States is, as you know, interested in the stability, security and
                        development of central Africa. Therefore, even though we have no nationals
                        among the mercenaries, we are prepared to cooperate with Rwanda, the Congo,
                        Belgium, France, and other countries and international organizations to
                        facilitate the implementation of this plan. Meanwhile, I would like to
                        assure you that we will make every effort to assist in the feeding of the
                        Katangans while they remain in Rwanda through the provision of available PL
                        480 foodstuffs.</p>
                    <p>Since time is of the essence, I strongly hope you will be able to give your
                        approval to this plan so that this threat to the security and well-being of
                        the area can be brought to an end.</p>

                        Schyns’ request (Kinshasa 5480)<note n="2" xml:id="d543fn2">Reference should
                            be to telegram 3251 from Kinshasa, August 25, which reported that Dr.
                            Charles Schyns, a Belgian businessman who had offered to act as an
                            informal intermediary between the Congolese Government and the
                            mercenaries, made a personal plea to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> for one last effort to evacuate the mercenaries
                            peacefully, and asked that there be no other U.S. or Belgian efforts
                            until August 27. (Ibid.)</note> you should speak with <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName>, and possibly, <persName corresp="#p_NVI_1">Nendaka</persName> along following lines:</p>
                    <p>2. We appreciate political considerations which make it difficult for Congo
                        to resume negotiations, even indirectly, on <gloss target="#t_merc_1">merc</gloss> withdrawal and evacuation. We also regret <gloss target="#t_GOR_1">GOR</gloss>’s action in refusing cooperation and
                        issuing communiqué.</p>
                    <p>3. Nevertheless we continue believe kind of solution which commendable
                        Congolese initiative envisaged seems to be most desirable, i.e. peaceful
                        withdrawal of mercs and Katangans either through Rwanda or from Congolese
                        territory.</p>
                    <pb n="787" facs="0820" xml:id="pg_787"/>
                    <p>4. If <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> insists on military solution it
                        obvious there could be considerable loss of life, danger that confrontation
                        would spill over into other parts of Congo and neighboring countries,
                        confirmation to international opinion that Congo is site of recurring
                        violence and bloodshed, and jeopardizing of <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> conference.</p>
                    <p>5. If <gloss target="#t_merc_1">merc</gloss>/Katangan force determined stand
                        fast <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> would need further resources
                        which would increase already heavy burden on <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> budget and whole economy. Even if successful effects would
                        be long-lasting.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> too wise and experienced
                        not to realize that turning to other sources such as Massamba-Debat’s Cubans
                        or Soviets for assistance will in long run lead only to undermining his
                        regime and endangering long-run Congolese stability.</p>
                    <p>7. Whatever short term political disadvantages <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> might see in peaceful withdrawal and evacuation, he
                        should realize that, with goodwill and cooperation, actually it likely to be
                        accomplished more rapidly than military reduction of mercenary force. In
                        long run it will have proved his statesmanship in getting rid of element
                        disruptive to Congolese internal security, and saving his country from
                        further bloodshed. If, as we assume, peaceful solution faster than military,
                        internal pressures on him will be relieved much sooner and interracial
                        harmony will have been preserved.<note n="3" xml:id="d543fn3">In telegram

                        has been offered and is very hard for <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> to refuse), and (2) to push <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> toward another try at an evacuation
                        plan of the sort which came within inches of success last week.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Situation</p>
                    <p>The mercenaries are still holed up in Bukavu on the Eastern border of the
                        Congo, 1200 miles from <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> in
                        Kinshasa. Schramme agreed last week to a plan to evacuate them through
                        Rwanda to Europe, but the plan fell through because of Belgian vagueness
                        about precisely how the evacuation would be carried out and Rwandan fear of
                        agreeing to anything which would put the mercenaries on Rwandan territory
                        without absolute assurance that they would leave immediately. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> is under heavy political pressure
                        from his own firebrands—including a good share of his army—to “do something”
                        about the mercenaries. But as of now he is helpless; his troops won’t fight
                        them, at least without air cover, and he has no pilots to operate the seven
                        T–28 trainer/fighters which represent his total tactical air force.</p>
                    <p>The situation is complicated by the fact that the Chinese-influenced Congo
                        Republic (Brazzaville) across the river has made it <pb n="789" facs="0822" xml:id="pg_789"/>clear to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                        that if he says the word they can and will supply enough Castro Cuban troops
                        to mop up the mercenaries. In addition, the Soviet Ambassador to Congo
                        (B)—there is now <hi rend="italic">no</hi> Soviet representation in Congo
                        (K)—has asked <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> to give him a
                        list of his military requirements, with the strong implication that the
                        Soviets are prepared to help him. In the light of their action in Nigeria,
                        it seems likely that they would jump at the chance, particularly since 150
                        mercenaries do not represent a very difficult problem for any reasonable
                        military force. The Algerians are also waiting in the wings.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has given us several signals
                        that he can’t hold out much longer against his internal critics unless he
                        has some further token of Western support that he can point to as good
                        reason for not accepting communist help. Moreover, he must be able to
                        present at least some credible threat to the mercenaries as a deterrent to
                        keep them from marching south to Katanga, a move which could well recreate
                        in precise and painful detail the secession situation of 1962–64—which we
                        have invested more than $500 million to avoid. And it is clear to any Congo
                        veteran that if the Brazzaville Cubans or Soviet troops ever get into the
                        Congo, it will be very hard to get them out. At the very least, we could
                        expect a whole new East-West dimension to the chronic problem of the Congo,
                        with dark implications for the rest of Africa.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Purpose of the Operation</p>
                    <p>The pilots would be a political bargaining counter, both within <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s councils and for <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName> in dealing with <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>. They would <hi rend="italic">not</hi> constitute a decisive military factor. We would hope they
                        would give <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> a marginal
                        capacity to present some threat to the mercenaries, give him some evidence
                        of Western support to counter pressure to accept Bloc aid, and give us the
                        leverage to get him to be an active force in moving toward a new evacuation
                        plan. (We are also working on the Brussels end of this problem; we may need
                        to come back to you on it later this week.)</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Risks</p>
                    <p>Like all covert operations, this one runs the risk of exposure. Until a few
                        months ago, the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> financed and controlled
                        pilots, aircraft and maintenance for the entire Congolese air force. (These
                        operations are now entirely financed and controlled by <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>.) The pilots we would supply would
                        be veterans of those days. It is conceivable that an enterprising reporter
                        (of whom there are very few in the Congo) could blow the cover, which could
                        be highly embarrassing here—though it would not have much effect, abroad, in
                        my judgment. It would be even more embarrassing if, after receiving the
                        pilots, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> kicked over the
                        traces and let the Bloc in and then the cover blew. Obviously, we would <pb n="790" facs="0823" xml:id="pg_790"/>maintain that the Congolese had
                        hired and paid the pilots, but these are serious risks, which you should
                        take carefully into account.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation</p>
                    <p>On balance, I would recommend we go ahead. We got away for several years,
                        through thick and thin, with covert operation of <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s entire air arm. I think the odds
                        are very good that we can get away with quiet support of five pilots now.
                        Moreover, although it may seem implausible to argue that giving <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> fighter pilots will make him more
                        peaceful-minded, I think it is our best chance of maximizing the chances of
                        an evacuation solution, while at the same time avoiding Bloc access to the
                        Congo. The costs of mercenary-inspired disintegration of the Congo and/or
                        Sino-Soviet involvement would be infinitely greater than the money cost and
                        political risk involved in this proposition. I would vote that you accept
                        the risks and approve the operation.</p>

                    <p>30697. Literally eyes only for Ambassador from Secretary. This message is a
                        personal thought about your 1235,<note n="2" xml:id="d545fn2">In telegram
                            1235 from Brussels, August 30, <persName corresp="#p_KRB_1">Knight</persName> discussed the possibility of a massacre of large
                            numbers of whites, mostly Belgians, in the Congo by the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> if the mercenary impasse were not
                            resolved. Noting that Belgium would find it most difficult, if not
                            impossible, to carry out a military-type rescue of its nationals, he
                            pointed out that the Belgians would probably turn to the United States
                            with a fervent eleventh-hour plea for help if such an event occurred.
                            (Ibid.)</note> the cogency of which I fully appreciate.</p>
                    <pb n="791" facs="0824" xml:id="pg_791"/>
                    <p>We would be greatly concerned if we got an emergency message from the
                        Belgians calling upon us for major assistance in the Congo in the absence of
                        a serious effort by a group of nations to play their part. We would be even
                        more concerned if the Belgians were to take our reactions to such a request
                        as a test of our loyalty to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> or to
                        them as a <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> ally.</p>
                    <p>It is easy and convenient for other governments to think that all they have
                        to do is to call on Uncle Sam to meet their necessary requirements in an
                        emergency. But we are not the mercenaries of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. To begin with, it is simply not true that the US is the
                        only nation physically able to provide such assistance. The Canadians, the
                        British, the French, the Turks, and perhaps other <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> allies all have transport aircraft. Most of them have
                        Boeing 707s or similar aircraft in their civil airlines which could, in an
                        emergency, be diverted for such purposes. Secondly, the fact that it may be
                        politically inconvenient or difficult for others to assist simply cannot
                        impose upon the US an obligation to act unilaterally.</p>
                    <p>If it is politically impossible for the Belgians to give <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> military help to dispose of the
                        mercenaries, it is no less politically impossible for the US to go rushing
                        in unilaterally to bail them out in the absence of a serious effort by other
                        governments. The day has passed when the US can take on such
                        responsibilities regardless of what others are doing, and what others are
                        willing to do for themselves.</p>
                    <p>Belgium is a member of the Common Market and has five partners who are fully
                        capable of making a significant contribution toward their common stake in
                        what happens in Africa. It is more than flesh and spirit can bear to suppose
                        that a prosperous, safe and lazy Europe can sit in comfort while calling
                        upon the US to do their disagreeable jobs for them.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of this message is to alert you to the seriousness of this
                        problem as far as we are concerned. I do not in this message wish to ask you
                        to take any specific step but I would be glad to have your advice as to
                        whether you should go to the Belgians and press upon them the urgent need
                        for doing some contingency planning with other members of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, most especially Western European
                        members, if a sudden emergency should develop in the Congo.</p>
                    <p>We need not be apologetic about this problem. We are carrying a major
                        struggle in Southeast Asia with a half million of our own forces to which
                        two Western European signatories of SEATO are making no contribution. At the
                        same time we are maintaining our forces in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> unimpaired. Even the prospective rotation of two brigades
                        has not been put into effect.</p>
                    <p>I know that we have important interests in Africa and that we ourselves are
                        concerned about what happens in the Congo. But we should <pb n="792" facs="0825" xml:id="pg_792"/>not be expected to be more concerned about
                        what happens in that vast continent than those who live next door in the
                        small peninsula called Western Europe.</p>
                    <p>Please give me your best thinking on these matters. One possibility would be
                        for me to send a frank and somewhat more tactfully worded message along the
                        above lines to <persName corresp="#p_HPI_1">Harmel</persName>. Personal

                        <salute>Mr. President:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>I have carried out consultations on the Congo problem and have the following
                        to report.</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Nick <persName corresp="#p_KNB_1">Katzenbach</persName></hi> (with whom I doubletalked—he is at Martha’s
                        Vineyard) says he is for the action so that <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName> will have some leverage over <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>. We have given <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName> little to work with; but he has
                        done a good job with what we have given him. In particular, <persName corresp="#p_KNB_1">Katzenbach</persName> is afraid of a threat to the
                        lives of the 10,000 or so whites in the Congo. He is not wholly clear about
                        how big the risk is of the operation blowing; or how much trouble it would
                        make if it did blow. But, on balance, he believes we should proceed.</p>
                    <p>2. Sec. <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> feels quite strongly
                        that we ought to do this thing. If the Congo goes into an anti-white pogrom,
                        we have already been warned by our Ambassador in Brussels that the Belgians
                        will press us very hard to preserve and fly out the Belgians who are there.
                        If we fail to do this, our Ambassador warns, the Belgians may regard this as
                        letting down a <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> ally. Sec. <persName corresp="#p_RDE_1">Rusk</persName> wishes to have the record show that
                        we did everything in our power to prevent that kind of situation from coming
                        about and that kind of choice staring at us.</p>
                    <p>3. Dick <persName corresp="#p_HRI_1">Helms</persName> recommends against
                        seeing Sen. <persName corresp="#p_RRB_1">Russell</persName>, mainly because
                        he is now at Winder, Georgia, recuperating. He has not responded to efforts
                        to engage him. For example, Scoop Jackson cannot get him to respond on a
                        matter which Sen. <persName corresp="#p_RRB_1">Russell</persName> asked Sen.
                        Jackson to <pb n="793" facs="0826" xml:id="pg_793"/>undertake. So far as
                        substance of the matter is concerned, <persName corresp="#p_HRI_1">Helms</persName> believes <persName corresp="#p_RRB_1">Russell</persName> would support it because he was against pulling the
                        pilots out in the first place. He was not enthusiastic about the commitment
                        of the pilots in the Congo, but he told Dick personally that he thought
                        pulling them out was unwise because “you will probably need them again.”
                        Therefore, Dick guesses that if the matter were put to him, he would remind
                        him of his previous position and say “I guess you have got to do it.”</p>
                    <p>With respect to the risk of the pilots becoming publicly known, Dick
                            <persName corresp="#p_HRI_1">Helms</persName> thinks the probability is
                        quite high that they will become known but he does not believe it will make
                        much noise because the use of foreigners to fly aircraft in that part of the
                        world is widespread.</p>

                            from Lisbon, September 5, recommended that if the Department decided to
                            call in the Portuguese Chargé, it emphasize that it had information
                            concerning mercenary presence and activities in Angola which, in light
                            of Portugal’s official assurances, it believed should be brought to the
                            Portuguese Government’s attention. The telegram also recommended that
                            the Department not base its approach on any accusations by the Congolese
                            Government, since this would merely anger the Portuguese.

                    <p>1. Dept Asst Sec <persName corresp="#p_TWC_1">Trimble</persName> called in
                        Portuguese Chargé September 5 to express our concern over situation in
                        Congo, particularly reports of mercenaries gathering in Angola and plotting
                        against <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, along lines para 4
                        reftel. After noting information that has been brought to our attention
                        concerning mercenary presence and activities in Angola, and report that 30
                        or more mercenaries landed Bukavu from unknown destination September 1st,
                            <persName corresp="#p_TWC_1">Trimble</persName> pointed out that failure
                        settle mercenary problem could mean serious risk of <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> accepting proffered Communist aid
                        and realigning his policy, not only to detriment Free World interests in
                        Congo, but also to detriment Portuguese interests. Further, <persName corresp="#p_TWC_1">Trimble</persName> stressed that continued <gloss target="#t_merc_1">merc</gloss> presence in Congo or arrival
                        reinforcements would result in increased racial tension in Congo threatening
                        lives of Africans and foreigners, including Americans and Portuguese.</p>
                    <p>2. In reply Chargé’s question as to sources our information, <persName corresp="#p_TWC_1">Trimble</persName> said it came from many sources in
                        many countries and directly from mercenaries and not repeat not from
                        Congolese Government. In conclusion, <persName corresp="#p_TWC_1">Trimble</persName> requested Chargé inform his government of knowledge
                        that had come to our attention as we share mutual interest in encouraging
                        stability and doing whatever possible to prevent further violence and
                        bloodshed in Congo.</p>
                    <p>3. Chargé promised to report conversation and asked if anything being done to
                        get mercenaries out of Congo. <persName corresp="#p_TWC_1">Trimble</persName> outlined our views on present evacuation proposals.
                        Chargé then said his government had considered what attitude to adopt toward
                        mercenaries if they go to Angola but did not indicate that any decision had
                        been reached.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Mr. Secretary:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>I appreciated your frank reply to my 1235<note n="2" xml:id="d548fn2">See
                                <ref target="#d545">Document 545</ref> and <ref target="#d545fn2">footnote 2</ref> thereto.</note> concerning possible unilateral
                        contingency planning on our part should the Belgians turn to us for
                        cooperation after they would have done all they could to bring out their
                        nationals in the Congo under conditions of the utmost gravity.</p>
                    <p>My only fear is that I did not make sufficiently clear in my telegram the
                        emphasis which I have placed in several talks both with Foreign Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_HPI_1">Harmel</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DVE_1">Davignon</persName> on the fact that they could not
                        in a new crisis turn to us to bail them out. I have done so in pointed
                        terms, stressing not only Vietnam and what we are doing there in the common
                        cause with no help from our <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Allies,
                        but also our own grave and varied difficulties at home.</p>
                    <p>The responsiveness of the Belgians in our current project of developing a
                        plan for the departure of the mercenaries would seem to show that my message
                        had carried home.</p>
                    <p>As to whether we should go further now, I recommend that we let the present
                        effort to eliminate the mercenary problem run its course. If this does not
                        succeed, then I think I should go to <persName corresp="#p_HPI_1">Harmel</persName> and press upon him the urgent need for contingency
                        planning by the Belgians with other members of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, most specially Western European members.</p>

                        should suffice and that we could hold in reserve the option of a personal
                        message from you.</p>

                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_HPI_1">Harmel</persName> thanked the
                        Acting Secretary for the personal interest he had taken in the problem of
                        the mercenaries in the Congo, and said that he wished to register his
                        Government’s deep appreciation for <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                        support to the Belgians during this difficult period. He also made special
                        mention of the excellent collaboration given by our Ambassadors in Brussels
                        and Kinshasa.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister said that his Government had no intention of disengaging
                        because of its fidelity to the Congolese people, its desire to prevent
                        further disorder and its wish to contribute to the peaceful development of
                        the country. In his view, after three months of acute difficulties the
                        operation looking towards the evacuation of the mercenaries now appeared to
                        be proceeding satisfactorily.</p>
                    <p>The Acting Secretary said that we appreciated this Belgian recognition of our
                        efforts in the Congo, and that we were particularly grateful for Belgian
                        efforts there to seek a peaceful withdrawal of the mercenaries. He, too,
                        hoped that the mercenary evacuation plan would be successful and that the
                        International Red Cross would not insist on dotting every “i” and crossing
                        every “t”, as undue delay might jeopardize its success. In commenting on the
                        plan, he said that he was particularly <pb n="798" facs="0831" xml:id="pg_798"/> encouraged by the recent <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> summit meeting in Kinshasa, which represented a major
                        effort by African leaders to deal with their own problems.</p>
                    <p>As for future Belgian technical assistance in teaching and health, <persName corresp="#p_HPI_1">Harmel</persName> said that a decision to return
                        Belgian technicians depended on satisfactory security guarantees from the
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> government.<note n="2" xml:id="d550fn2">Telegram 47323 to Brussels, October 2, reported that
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> told Bihin on
                            September 29 that the Congolese Government had decided against providing
                            the Belgian Government with written assurances about security in the
                            Congo. (Ibid.)</note> He hoped that a solution would be found in the
                        following days so that the uncertainties and dangers which Belgian nationals
                        have traditionally faced would be removed. As one element in giving Belgians
                        the necessary sense of security, the Foreign Minister was particularly
                        interested in the establishment of a permanent Belgo-Congolese Commission to
                        deal effectively with future crises as they arose.</p>
                    <p>The Acting Secretary said that he was pleased to note the Belgian desire to
                        continue its assistance to the Congo and hoped that satisfactory guarantees
                        could be worked out to ensure the safety of the Belgians in the Congo. He
                        thought future crises inevitable but hoped that in the ups and downs of
                        Congolese politics they would become less and less serious. In his view, the
                        seriousness of any particular crisis would probably rest on the question of
                        how much power General <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has
                        throughout the country at any given time.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion the Foreign Minister said that while the Congo was of almost
                        constant concern to Belgium, his Government was in the final analysis far
                        more preoccupied with the evolution of Europe and the future of the Atlantic
                        Alliance.</p>

                    <p>4738. Subject: Mercenary evacuation.</p>
                    <p>1. I am becoming increasingly concerned at snail-like way in which mercenary
                        evacuation operation moving. Dept knows as well as I highly unstable nature
                        of <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and his tendency to lose
                        his temper. Just because he has been sweet and patient over recent weeks
                        since <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> resolution on mercenaries does
                        not mean he will not revert to type. Furthermore, he is under pressure from
                        variety of sources within his own govt and especially in army to reject
                        negotiated settlement and insist on military solution. <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> has frankly admitted to me he
                        remains personally opposed to implementation of <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> resolution.</p>
                    <p>2. In light this background, I consider it currently rather unlikely lid can
                        be kept on during considerable time it will apparently take <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> representative to visit a lot of African
                        capitals, which have no communication with each other, and while there is
                        interminable haggling as to who will pay expenses of operation.</p>
                    <p>3. Furthermore if we want operation to succeed, it is imperative to keep
                        Belgians in background. Surfacing of fact D’Ursel is coaching from sidelines
                        in Geneva would be enough to enrage Congolese as he is particularly disliked
                        here, along with <persName corresp="#p_DVE_1">Davignon</persName>. While it
                        is hard to ask Belgians to pick up tab and at same time be inconspicuous,
                        this is precisely view of Belgian <gloss target="#t_Amb_1">Amb</gloss> Bihin
                        here.</p>
                    <p>4. I would hazard guess operation can still have chance of success if carried
                        out in next week or ten days. Otherwise, I would consider chances fairly
                        remote. Furthermore, we are at mercy at any moment of having entire
                        operation blown up if mercenaries are reinforced.</p>
                    <p>5. On specific points, we agree Rubli suggestion (Geneva 1084)<note n="2" xml:id="d551fn2">Dated October 5. (Ibid.)</note> it would be better to
                        skip Burundi phase of operations which seems fraught with dangerous
                        possibilities. We also agree with Geneva’s point that more matter in hands
                        of <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> the better.</p>
                    <p>6. Obviously we have made no commitments to Congolese for US assistance, but
                        we may receive requests in next few days. While it is easy for me to sit
                        here and say Dept should do something, I cannot in all conscience not state
                        my profound hope that if requests are made of <pb n="800" facs="0833" xml:id="pg_800"/>US by Congolese or <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss>, we can carry them out in interest of preventing collapse
                        of operation. If this occurred, we might all be in very serious difficulties
                        indeed in the Congo.<note n="3" xml:id="d551fn3">Telegram 50588 to Geneva,

                    <p>51385. For Ambassador from Secretary.</p>
                    <p>1. Please deliver following message from me to <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> DirGen <persName corresp="#p_GRO_1">Gallopin</persName>.</p>
                    <p>2. “You know of our concern over the situation in the Congo. We have believed
                        that the peaceful evacuation of the mercenaries along the lines proposed by
                        the Organization of African Unity is essential if the Congo is not to
                        experience another tragedy. For this reason we have been gratified with the
                        actions the International Commission of the Red Cross has already taken to
                        put into operation a workable plan to evacuate the mercenaries and the
                        Katangese.</p>
                    <p>We hope that you will be able to move rapidly to put this plan into effect.
                        It seems to me that each day’s delay makes more difficult the final
                        solution. Each of the vitally interested parties, the Congolese government
                        and the mercenaries, may be tempted to take other actions which might bring
                        about the tragedy we all want to avoid. It might be useful for you, while
                        working out final details, to try to send representatives to Kinshasa and
                        Bukavu so as to keep up the momentum towards a peaceful solution.</p>
                    <p>I know that you have financial problems in handling this task. As Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_TRW_1">Tubby</persName> told you the other day, we
                        are seeking and hope to <pb n="801" facs="0834" xml:id="pg_801"/>have
                        shortly an additional $200,000 to help cover the extraordinary expenditures
                        the <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> has already encountered in its
                        recent operations. I hope to be able to confirm this contribution soon.</p>
                    <p>We consider the Congo evacuation essential if there is to be peace and
                        stability in Central Africa and would not want your mission to fail,
                        especially for lack of funds. I therefore want to assure you that my
                        government will make sure that the <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss>
                        does not suffer financially from its humanitarian mission in the Congo. As
                        you know, the Belgian Government is seeking to find additional money and is
                        in touch with other countries which may be prepared to help. If the results
                        of this effort are insufficient, we will do what we have to, in addition to
                        the large contributions we have or are about to make, to assure your
                        success. If there are other problems, such as transport, we will try to be
                        helpful.</p>
                    <p>With this thought in mind, I want to restate our hope that you can move
                        forward promptly on this urgent problem.</p>

                        agricultural products have fallen off badly. They haven’t gotten as much
                        copper out of Katanga as they had hoped, so their export earnings are likely
                        to be quite a bit lower than planned. Despite all this, Mobuto has put into
                        effect a comprehensive program of economic reforms—including a devaluation.
                        He badly needs this support to hold the line.</p>

                            telegram 4945, said he did not believe that this was an appropriate time
                            to reduce the number of aircraft at Ascension. (Ibid.)</note></p>
                    <p>1. Have seriously considered your suggestion that C–130s positioned Ascension
                        Island be brought forward now to Kinshasa for possible evacuation needs and
                        as clear indication to mercenaries of US support for <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>2. With great reluctance we unable respond favorably your suggestion at this
                        time for following reasons:</p>
                    <p>a) Sudden appearance two more aircraft in Kinshasa without thorough and
                        adequate briefing key members of Congress could arouse additional antipathy
                        here. We reluctant to give out sensitive information about possible
                        mercenary activity from Angola.</p>
                    <p>b) C–130s not most suitable aircraft for mass evacuation although they ideal
                        for gathering US citizens from interior. More useful C–141s or commercial
                        counterparts would require decision to evacuate.</p>
                    <p>c) If mercenary invasion from Angola to be successful we suspect it will be
                        so rapid that full evacuation may be impossible.</p>
                    <p>d) We doubt, without adequate publicity, which we do not wish see generated,
                        that word would get to mercenaries rapidly.</p>
                    <p>e) C–130s might be called forward on “resupply” mission but their withdrawal
                        after two or three days might nullify effect you wish create.</p>
                    <p>3. We willing of course reconsider if further info becomes available which
                        would indicate that C–130s presence in Kinshasa necessary.</p>

                        and General <persName corresp="#p_WEG_1">Wheeler</persName>. It authorizes
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName> and our Ambassador in
                        Geneva to tell the International Red Cross that we would respond favorably
                        to a Red Cross request to use the three U.S. military aircraft now in the
                        Congo to help evacuate the mercenaries and their Congolese henchmen. The
                        three planes involved are the one C–130 still in the Congo, the C–123
                        assigned to our Military Advisory Team, and our Air Attaché’s C–54. (We
                        would <hi rend="italic">not</hi> bring back the two C–130’s we pulled out in
                        late summer.)</p>
                    <p>We would insist that the Red Cross request be strongly worded and that we
                        have the right to make it public. We would also tell them that our favorable
                        response is primarily designed to make it easier for them to get other
                        countries to make similar contributions.</p>
                    <p>This decision arises because, after endless haggling, the Red Cross has
                        finally negotiated an evacuation plan acceptable to all parties. It involves
                        three steps:</p>
                    <p>1. A battalion is flown in from the neighboring Central African Republic to
                        supervise the evacuation and guarantee safe passage for the mercenaries.</p>
                    <p>2. The mercenaries are flown to Malta.</p>
                    <p>3. The 1,000 plus Congolese (Katangans) now with the mercs are flown to
                        Zambia.</p>
                    <p>All this must be done quickly. The operation will be mounted from an airport
                        in Rwanda, the only nearby field large enough to take big <pb n="805" facs="0838" xml:id="pg_805"/>transports. Rwandan President <persName corresp="#p_KGR_1">Kayibanda</persName> insists that the job be done in
                        a period of no more than four days so as to minimize the risk of trouble
                        while the evacuees are in his country. This is a big job—about 20 C–130
                        round trips at about 8 hours per round trip. It would probably take five
                        C–130’s to do the job in four days.</p>
                    <p>The only non-U.S. aircraft now in sight are two Zambian C–130’s which we are
                        now reasonably certain will be available. We are scouring the landscape for
                        other planes from African countries and from Europe, as well as looking into
                        other kinds of transport. But prospects are bleak. <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName> has concluded that the evacuation
                        probably won’t happen without our logistic support and has requested
                        “earnest consideration” of bringing the two U.S. C–130’s back to the Congo
                        for this purpose.</p>
                    <p>The request to bring back the two C–130’s has been denied. This message tells
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName> that he is free to use
                        the planes now in the Congo. Nobody can guarantee that we will not have to
                        make the C–130 decision again if the evacuation effort breaks down, but
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName> understands that the
                        chances of reversal are very slim.</p>
                    <p>We have a considerable stake in a successful evacuation. If the mercenaries
                        can be peacefully spirited out of the Congo, there is reasonable chance of
                        relative stability for sometime to come. If they remain, every day increases
                        the chances that there will be an attempt to reinforce them (we have
                        intelligence that strongly suggests a Portuguese-backed reinforcement effort
                        in neighboring Angola), and/or that they will decide to march south to
                        Katanga. The latter would almost certainly lead to civil war and a real
                        threat that the country would come apart. In short, we would be back in the
                        same situation we have spent more than half a billion dollars over the last
                        six years to escape.</p>
                    <p>I think we should go ahead with this limited step. I doubt that it will hurt
                        us much in the Congress to respond to a Red Cross appeal to use planes
                        already on the ground in an evacuation effort which is clearly an attempt to
                        avoid more fighting. I recommend you approve the message.</p>

                    <p>1. Our C–130’s have not moved from Ascension. We have told the Red Cross that
                        we are prepared to use them in an international evacuation operation if (a)
                        the plan is workable and (b) there are reasonable security safeguards for
                        the aircraft.</p>
                    <p>2. The mercenaries and Katangans (about 2,000 with families) are just over
                        the border in Rwanda. They are largely disarmed, but some still wear
                        sidearms.</p>
                    <p>3. The Congolese are feeling their oats. (After all, this is the first
                        victory in the history of the Congolese army.) <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and this Foreign Minister have told us that they are
                        now against any evacuation and will petition Rwanda to extradite the
                        mercenaries “for trial” in the Congo. They are trying to get the Red Cross
                        to give up and go home.</p>
                    <p>4. The Red Cross has not given up on the evacuation, nor have the Belgians
                        who are very worried (a) that the mercenaries—who are mostly Belgians—will
                        be massacred and (b) this will bring on racial disaster in the Congo.</p>
                    <pb n="809" facs="0842" xml:id="pg_809"/>
                    <p>5. Thus, the Belgians have arranged to send a Sabena 727 to Kigali, Rwanda,
                        today. This plane could take most of the mercenaries to Europe in one load
                        if the Rwandans will allow them to proceed from their present location to
                        the City of Kigali and then to leave the country.</p>
                    <p>6. An airlift for the 1800 Katangans has yet to be arranged. Ours is the only
                        firm offer the Red Cross has. The Canadians and several other countries are
                        thinking over similar offers. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s attitude suggests that he may be more receptive to
                        letting the Katangans go than he is about the mercenaries.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName> is having second thoughts
                        about a U.S. role in an evacuation. He recommends we keep our planes at
                        Ascension and wait to see what happens today—whether the Belgian plane
                        actually arrives at Kigali, whether <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> softens on letting the mercenaries out, whether other
                        aircraft for the Katangan evacuation actually materializes and whether the
                        Rwandans hold to their willingness to let the evacuation happen rather than
                        driving the group back into the Congo.</p>
                    <p>8. The consensus here is to go along with <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName>, but to be ready to act very quickly if a truly
                        international evacuation effort does jell. Congolese victories, heretofore
                        entirely unknown, are likely to be very fragile.</p>

                        development as quickly as possible. Towards this end, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s strongest position would be to
                        take following line:</p>
                    <p>(1) Merc forces with rebel support have been routed in Bukavu and Congo is
                        now rid of this cancer. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                        regrets <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> victories have created
                        problem for fellow African state of Rwanda and he wishes only see this
                        problem liquidated as soon as possible.</p>
                    <p>(2) Elements presently in Rwanda are worthless and <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> wishes nothing more to do with them. So far as mercs are
                        concerned, it only wishes assure they do not return Congo, as notorious
                        Denard and others have done.</p>
                    <p>(3) Therefore <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> would have no objection
                        to <gloss target="#t_GOR_1">GOR</gloss> permitting repatriation to Europe of
                        these elements on following conditions: (i) <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> would obtain appropriate assurances that mercs will not
                        return to Africa, (ii) <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> would transmit
                        such assurances to countries of which they are nationals in order that they
                        may take steps within their power prevent mercs return to Congo.</p>
                    <p>(4) <gloss target="#t_Re_1">Re</gloss> Katgens, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> should take posture that these are poor misguided
                        people against whom he has no grudge but only feels sorrow. If they desire
                        return Congo, they can do so under absolute guarantee of amnesty which he
                        has already signed. Otherwise he has no objection their settlement in Zambia
                        until such time as they may wish return.</p>
                    <p>(b) In putting foregoing to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                        you should stress that in eyes of world he has won remarkable military
                        victory. Moreover, strong public position which US has taken against
                        Portugal (at considerable expense to other aspects of our relationship) has
                        created considerable embarrassment to that country and appears have forced
                        it on defensive. It would be great pity for <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> to lose sympathy which Congo presently enjoys and to
                        obscure onus which presently rests on Portugal by taking vindictive line.
                        (You may wish show <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> texts
                        recent <hi rend="italic">NY Times</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Wash</hi>
                        <hi rend="italic">Post</hi> editorials.) In this connection <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> should be <pb n="811" facs="0844" xml:id="pg_811"/>aware that <persName corresp="#p_NAF_1">Nogueira</persName> presently visiting US (trip arranged some time ago
                        without relation current developments), and that it would be unfortunate if
                        Congo position played into his hands by actions which ignore humanitarian
                        and practical aspects of present situation.</p>
                    <p>(c) <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> should also understand
                        that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> has, at considerable domestic
                        expense, strongly supported <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> both
                        through C–130s and its military and economic aid programs. We have
                        undertaken extensive consultations with Congress re participation in
                        humanitarian operation to liquidate <gloss target="#t_merc_1">merc</gloss>
                        and Katgen problem. Congress and American people will not be able understand
                        hard and vindictive position by <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> which might obviate any possibility peaceful
                        resolution of problem without further bloodshed, and this inevitably will
                        affect what we are able to do for him in future.</p>
                    <p>(d) Although <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> may be able risk
                        adverse international reactions on humanitarian grounds which likely to
                        follow mass extradition of <gloss target="#t_merc_1">merc</gloss>/Katgen
                        group to Congo, he should be aware that, if he successfully pressures <gloss target="#t_GOR_1">GOR</gloss> to agree to extradition, he would open
                        Rwanda to same charges. Rwandan copy book already blotted by Tutsi massacres
                        of 1963 and we doubt it would wish be linked with extradition or involuntary
                        repatriation effort. Putting strong pressures on Rwanda could conceivably
                        force <gloss target="#t_GOR_1">GOR</gloss> cooperation but might also be
                        harmful to future of <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_GOR_1">GOR</gloss> relations.</p>
                    <p>3. In short, you should try convince <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> that he has unprecedented opportunity take
                        statesmanlike, humanitarian posture at this moment which would contrast
                        markedly with very tarnished Portuguese image. We strongly hope he can see
                        problem this way, taking appropriate advantage of <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> resolution, his military victories and his strong position
                        in <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> toward this end.</p>
                    <p>4. In light foregoing, we strongly hope he can find way to facilitate <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> operation at least by acquiescing in
                        it.</p>
                    <p>5. Suggest you inform Gafner and Bihin of approach you instructed to
                        make.</p>

                    <p>On November 15, 1967, the U.N. Security Council adopted without objection
                        Resolution 241 (1967) condemning Portugal’s failure to prevent mercenaries
                        from using the territory of Angola under its administration <pb n="812" facs="0845" xml:id="pg_812"/> as a base for armed attacks against the
                        Congo. (U.N. Doc. S/RES/241) The resolution was passed in response to a
                        November 3 Congolese appeal to the Council that it take the necessary
                        measures to stop aggression by armed mercenaries based in Angola against the
                        Congo, and to ensure the safety of persons and property in the threatened
                        areas. (U.N. Doc. S/8218) For text of both resolutions, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1967</hi>,

                    <p>1. The mercenaries (around 120) and the Katangans (about 2,000 with families)
                        are still sitting in what amounts to internment camps across the border in
                        Rwanda. Our three C–130’s (2 still on Ascension, 1 in the Congo) are waiting
                        to help in an international evacuation provided (a) the plan is workable and
                        (b) there are reasonable security guarantees for our aircraft.</p>
                    <p>2. The Red Cross has other promises for aircraft on the same conditions. The
                        Canadians have a C–130 also on Ascension. The British have pledged an Argosy
                        transport (about C–130 size) which is still in the U.K. There’s a Belgian
                        DC–6 waiting at the scene. And the French have a DC–3 ready to move in.</p>
                    <p>3. Consequently, the Red Cross could conceivably begin in 48 hours or so to
                        fly out the <hi rend="italic">Katangans</hi>. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has told us he approves this part of the evacuation,
                        and claims the Zambians are ready to take them. But the Zambians say they
                        can’t move without ”express request” from the Congo to take the Katangans.
                        Zambia thinks that request will come out of an <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Commission meeting tomorrow in Kinshasa. Flying the 2,000
                        Katangans to Zambia would involve our C–130s and probably all the other air
                        craft except France’s DC–3, which the French <pb n="813" facs="0846" xml:id="pg_813"/>have earmarked for white (French) mercenaries. The
                        operation ferrying the Katangans would take several days.</p>
                    <p>4. The tougher problem is evacuating the white mercenaries who would then be
                        left in Rwanda. It’s anybody’s guess how soon they’ll get out to Malta.</p>
                    <p>5. A week ago <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> was in the flush
                        of victory (a first for the Congolese army) and calling for “extradition” of
                        the whites. He has since fallen back to a face-saving formula which was
                        adopted over the weekend by the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>
                        Commission on Mercenaries.<note n="3" xml:id="d561fn3">A special session of
                            the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Commission on Mercenaries
                            meeting in Kinshasa November 11–13 decided to place the mercenaries in
                            Rwanda under the “jurisdiction” of the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> and send a delegation to Kigali to interrogate them. It
                            also decreed that the governments of which the mercenaries were
                            nationals must compensate the Congo and give guarantees that the
                            mercenaries, once repatriated, would never return to Africa.</note> But
                        the conditions of this formula are still exacting and could mean delay in
                        completing the evacuation. To let the whites go, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> is requiring:</p>
                    <p>—some “compensation” for damages from the parent countries (read Belgium and
                        France)</p>
                    <p>—written assurances from the mercenaries themselves <hi rend="italic">and</hi> their parent countries that they’ll never enter the Congo
                        again</p>
                    <p>—an ad hoc <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> tribunal to screen and
                        question the mercenaries before they leave Rwanda, trying to find out who
                        planned their operation, who financed them, etc.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName> thinks these conditions
                        make it “obvious” that the mercenary problem will drag on “for weeks at
                        best”—even if we get the Katangans out to Zambia this week. He reports that
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> sees these conditions as
                        minimum punishment for the mercenaries, and will be in no mood for any short
                        cut.</p>
                    <p>7. State is a little more hopeful that a quick and sensible response from the
                        Belgians and French might satisfy <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and thus put the whites on the planes. They point
                        out:</p>
                    <p>—The Belgians have already offered to help in Red Cross relief for Bukavu and
                        we think the French can be persuaded to do likewise. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> just might accept this token
                        compensation as sufficient.</p>
                    <p>—The Belgians have a suitable anti-mercenary law already in Parliament, and
                        State thinks the French could meet <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s demands for assurances with some new passport
                        regulations restricting French nationals who were involved.</p>

                        actions re Katgens and mercs. Problem arises most immediately in connection

                        to repatriate those Katgens who have expressed willingness return to Congo.
                        Any refusal on our part likely immediately jeopardize our relationships with

                        future <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> role, all current indications
                        are that these procedures would not bear international scrutiny on
                        humanitarian lines. From this viewpoint, therefore, it is largely irrelevant
                        whether Katgens return to Congo in US, Congolese, or other aircraft, or
                        whether they proceed by surface. To US and world opinion principal concern
                        will be whether they go back of their own free will and are accorded genuine
                        protection under meaningful amnesty arrangements.</p>
                    <p>3. I recognize how difficult it is to get <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and members his government to look at this problem
                        from foregoing point of view. I realize also extreme strain to which
                            US-<gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> relationship and your own
                        personal relations with <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> have
                        been put as result developments last few months. At same time, I believe it
                        essential that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> should be
                        fully aware of public outcry that will undoubtedly result in this country
                        and elsewhere in Western world if he deals with these people summarily.
                        (Among important elements here, any such summary treatment will inevitably
                        be complicated by concerns re summary justice accorded to <persName corresp="#p_TMK_1">Tshombe</persName>.)</p>
                    <p>4. Any such development as foregoing would be unfortunate at any time but it
                        would be doubly so at moment. <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss>, with
                        strong US support, has just won important victory in <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> and Portuguese have received <pb n="815" facs="0848" xml:id="pg_815"/> strong setback. Any arbitrary actions at this time by
                            <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> would be bound to jeopardize much
                        of sympathy and good will which Congo has gained and would play directly
                        into Portuguese hands. We do not believe this in interest of Congo or its
                        friends.</p>
                    <p>5. Drawing as appropriate on foregoing, you should see <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> soonest. You should make following
                        points clear on instructions from your government:</p>
                    <p>(A) <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> must find means in his own
                        interest of making unmistakably clear to world that Katgens are being given
                        free choice re their destinations, that those who elect to return to Congo
                        will have full amnesty and complete protection and that those who proceed to
                        other African destinations will similarly be protected.</p>
                    <p>(B) Towards this end, he must do everything required to reengage <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> in impartially ascertaining desires of
                        Katgens, leaving to <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> determination
                        whether they return to Congo or accept asylum in some other country.</p>
                    <p>(C) He must take whatever diplomatic steps are required to request receiving
                        African countries to accept Katgens.</p>
                    <p>(D) Under these conditions and if other countries participate, <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> will assist <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> with transport for movement of Katgens.</p>
                    <p>(E) In absence such arrangements, <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> can
                        neither furnish aircraft nor utilize existing aircraft in Congo in way which
                        would release Congolese transport for this purpose.</p>
                    <p>(F) <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> should be fully aware that
                        any effort to repatriate Katgens under circumstances which do not meet
                        humanitarian considerations involved will probably provoke reaction in US
                        which will render impossible continuation level of support we have rendered
                        Congo in past. As hard as we find this to say to him, we must make point in
                        frankness and friendship.</p>
                    <p>6. I realize this is strong medicine but I see no alternative. However your
                        conversation turns out, I want you to know how greatly we have admired
                        patient and skillful way in which you have dealt with these elusive and
                        frustrating problems. Good luck.<note n="2" xml:id="d562fn2">In telegram

                    <p>5723. For Under Secretary from <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName>:</p>
                    <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> received me Saturday
                        morning on board boat. I outlined in full Dept’s instructions as contained
                        in State 70801.<note n="2" xml:id="d563fn2"><ref target="#d562">Document
                                562</ref>.</note> I stressed Dept’s view about public outcry in US
                        in event Katangese harmed after their return to Congo. I made all six
                        numbered points contained in paragraph five.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> said he was deeply shocked
                        and disappointed in Dept’s refusal to help him. He said <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> had withdrawn from operation and there
                        was no possibility of calling them back into game. I said that under my
                        instructions, I was therefore forced to tell him US could not furnish any
                        aircraft assistance whatever in connection with resettlement of Katangese.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> replied simply in that
                        event, Congo would have to take care of transport problem herself by other
                        means.</p>
                    <p>3. With regard to Katangese, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                        gave me lengthy description of his plans for handling them. He insisted that
                        they had all decided to return to Congo and that <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> had held personal conversation
                        with Monga who wished to be reintegrated into life of Congo. He said he had
                        decided to place Katangese for a period of a few months in Iberu near
                        Mbandaka and he wanted to start movement by air from Kigali as soon as
                        possible. He said he felt Katangese might be in some danger if they went to
                        Katanga while so many <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> units were still
                        in Kamina area and it was for reason of guaranteeing their protection that
                        he was sending them to Iberu where only soldiers were a few Katangese.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> added that if Dept was so
                        worried about future of these men, he was willing to establish an
                        international commission that could visit them every two weeks to see they
                        were not being harmed.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> added that furthermore full
                        prestige of <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> was behind this
                        resettlement of Katangese. He said they would be permitted to resettle
                        elsewhere in Congo after brief period. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> stated he was going on radio later today to read his
                        full declaration on this subject and to explain to Congolese people why it
                        was essential these Katangese be peacefully reintegrated into life of
                        country even though they had borne arms against <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>. He said he felt very deeply about this.</p>
                    <pb n="817" facs="0850" xml:id="pg_817"/>
                    <p>5. With regard to para 5(A) of Dept’s instruction, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> said he could give most categoric
                        assurances on this point. He said full weight of Africa was behind this
                        solution and effective implementation of amnesty. Reverting to <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> said they had withdrawn and it was not possible to
                        consider having them again interrogate Katangese after <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> had already done so, and important point
                        was to get Katangese resettled in Congo. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> insisted that he was satisfied pressure had not been
                        used on Katangese. I said we had reports to contrary, but he denied
                        these.</p>
                    <p>6. I reiterated Dept’s concern at reaction in US both publicly and in
                        government circles if Katangese were mistreated. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> said he was profoundly hurt Dept
                        doubted his word as to their safety. He said amnesty decree was a law of the
                        nation and must be observed. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                        continued saying that, far from adding to his difficulties, Dept should be
                        helping him with problem of resettling Katangese. He said he simply failed
                        to understand Dept’s attitude regarding an internal Congolese problem which
                        he thought could achieve a satisfactory solution especially if Congo’s
                        friends could help. I repeated Dept’s refusal to assist with aircraft in any
                        way under circumstances he outlined. He repeated Congo would simply have to
                        proceed with her own resources (“se debrouiller”).</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> concluded with fairly
                        impassioned statement about his surprise that his word as Chief of State was
                        being doubted by Dept, and expressed regret US was not helping in this
                        operation. He said apparently Dept did not trust him, and this of course was
                        blow to him.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>1. This memorandum contains a recommendation for the approval of the
                        Director. The recommendation is contained in paragraph five.</p>
                    <p>2. Transmitted herewith is a proposal to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD_1">Kohler</persName> prepared by the African Bureau of
                        the Department of State recommending that he approve a telephonic request to
                        the 303 principals for extension through 31 December 1967 of the contracts
                        of five pilots hired by the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> to fly for
                        the Congolese Government.<note n="2" xml:id="d564fn2">Attached but not
                            printed.</note></p>
                    <p>3. When recruited on 4 September 1967, these pilots signed contracts
                        effective through 4 December 1967 but agreed orally to extend for an extra
                        month if requested to do so. Preliminary indications are that some of the
                        pilots may not wish to extend their contracts for personal reasons. The
                        African Bureau believes that if as many as three pilots remain they would be
                        sufficient. But if less than three remain, replacement pilots will be
                        required.</p>
                    <p>4. President <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> was recently
                        upset by the Department of State decision that the U.S. would not supply
                        aircraft for evacuating the Katangese rebels from Rwanda. Since then
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName> has been asked to
                        undertake a very difficult démarche with <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> in connection with the return of these rebels. The
                        African Bureau believes and we agree that the withdrawal of the
                        U.S.-supplied pilots at the 30 November 1967 termination of their contracts
                        would tend only to further alienate <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, especially since these pilots are presently the only
                        ones in the Congo capable of flying combat and support missions.</p>
                    <p>5. For the reasons outlined in paragraph four, we recommend that the proposed
                        extension be approved.<note n="3" xml:id="d564fn3">The memorandum indicates
                            the <gloss target="#t_DDP_1">DDP</gloss> approved on Nov. 21 and
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRI_1">Helms</persName> approved Nov. 22. A
                            handwritten notation on the attachment indicates that the 303 Committee
                            approved the proposal telephonically on November 22.</note></p>

                            (Ibid.)</note></p>
                    <p>1. I had long talk with <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> this morning about
                        withdrawal of JTE. I explained JTE has long since accomplished its original
                        mission in connection with mercenary revolt and had assisted in ferrying
                        troops to put down Angolan invasion as well. These threats had been met and
                        situation was back to normal now. Therefore we believe that time to withdraw
                            <gloss target="#t_JTF_1">JTF</gloss> had now come.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> explained at great length
                        his continued preoccupation with situation and especially with security
                        situation in Kivu. He felt it was essential to move virtually all forces out
                        of that area and he pleaded for C–130 to complete this task as well as bring
                        first paras back from Katanga. I said C–130 was already vigorously engaged
                        in this task and I was sure would complete it in few days.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> said it was difficult to
                        set a date for departure of <gloss target="#t_JTF_1">JTF</gloss> but finally
                        proposed December 15. I said I had thought in earlier terms perhaps of early
                        next week. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> then made firm
                        suggestion of December in which he pointed out would round out five months
                        of JTE response to his original appeal. I indicated that this seemed
                        agreeable to me and that this would be acceptable unless he heard to the
                        contrary.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> is obviously reluctant to
                        see <gloss target="#t_JTF_1">JTF</gloss> go but I believe has accepted our
                        reasoning. He has formally committed himself to date of December 10 for
                        departure of final C–130. I strongly hope this date will be acceptable to
                        Dept and to Defense. I would be most extremely reluctant to go back and ask
                        for earlier departure date. Furthermore, I think actual task <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has in mind can be accomplished in
                        just about this time. It seems to be an entirely reasonable and amicable way
                        of terminating a highly successful operation.</p>
                    <p>5. I explained to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> that we
                        would wish some publicity on occasion of departure <gloss target="#t_JTF_1">JTF</gloss> and that we would be in touch with <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> with draft release in few
                            days.<note n="3" xml:id="d565fn3">Telegram 77170 to Kinshasa, November

                        neighboring Rwanda. All along, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has insisted on two conditions for letting the whites
                        go back to Europe: (1) guarantees from parent countries (Belgium and France)
                        that they would not return to the Congo; and (2) some compensation for
                        damages. The problem is being discussed this weekend at an East African
                        Chiefs of State meeting in Uganda. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> is at this meeting to press his case.</p>

                    <p>(a) U.S. gravely concerned over possibility Congolese may take military
                        action against Rwanda as intimated by <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CLG_1">Cyr</persName>.</p>
                    <p>(b) US hopes problem of mercenaries can be solved to satisfaction of all
                        interested parties, but does not believe that military solution, under any
                        circumstances, can serve interest of Congo. Issue would inevitably go to
                        Security Council and cause great difficulties for Congo and its friends.</p>
                    <p>(c) In any case T–28 aircraft precluded from use outside Congo by terms of
                            <gloss target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss> agreement. (Under terms of US–Congo
                            <gloss target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss> agreement T–28’s can only be used
                        for internal security or legitimate self defense. Use for any other purpose
                        would require <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> approval which could not
                        be given in this case.)</p>
                    <p>(d) US not involved in mercenary problem and believes <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> should continue to attempt resolve
                        directly with parties concerned.</p>
                    <p>2. If asked whether US has approached Belgians or others in matter,
                        Ambassador should reply that we have not for reasons stated in (d)

                    <p>Dear Mr. Minister:</p>
                    <p>It was a great pleasure to see you again in Brussels and participate with you
                        in a <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Council Meeting. The success of
                        this meeting was due in large part to your efforts and I want you to know
                        how much we all appreciate the time and thought you have given to making our
                        Alliance an effective instrument for dealing with our common problems.</p>
                    <p>I have your message of December 23 regarding the renewed problems of the
                        mercenaries and I wish to assure you of our concern and our realization of
                        the seriousness of this situation as it affects Belgo-Congolese
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>Our experience with the difficult and complex Congolese situation has taught
                        us that our influence can only be productive when used with the greatest
                        care and when we have taken the fullest account of the appropriate role for
                        the United States. With regard to the present mercenary problem, we believe
                        that the European governments whose nationals are involved should take the
                        lead. This is not because we believe the situation is any less serious than
                        you do but merely reflects our judgment as to how we can be most useful in
                        attempting to resolve this complex problem.</p>
                    <p>I want to assure you that we will look for every opportunity to be of
                        assistance. While the Vice President<note n="4" xml:id="d568fn4">Vice
                            President <persName corresp="#p_HHH_1">Humphrey</persName> made a 13-day
                            trip to Africa, December 29–January 11, during which he visited nine
                            African nations, including the Congo.</note> will be aware of the
                        situation <pb n="823" facs="0856" xml:id="pg_823"/>regarding the
                        mercenaries, I do not think that it would be useful or wise for him to make
                        a special démarche on this subject. If the opportunity arises as the result
                        of <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> raising this matter, the
                        Vice President will state that, while we hold no brief for the mercenaries,
                        as a practical matter, we feel it would be to everyone’s best interest,
                        including the Congo’s, if the mercenaries were permitted to return to Europe
                        and thus rid Africa of this difficult problem.</p>
                    <p>One additional thought has occurred to us. Would it not be possible for
                        private interests in Europe to launch a public appeal for funds to help
                        rebuild Bukavu? A generous, dramatic effort of this kind might help to lift
                        this entire problem from its present stale-mated political level to a new
                        humanitarian plane. If this idea has merit and is practical, we should be
                        glad to see what we can do informally with private interests on this side of
                        the Atlantic.</p>
                    <p>Once again let me assure you that we will be looking for every opportunity to
                        be of assistance and hope that your efforts with the other European states
                        will be successful.</p>
                    <p>I sincerely hope that the new year will bring solutions to these difficult
                        problems. Although our tasks are often hard, it is always a great pleasure
                        to be able to work with you, and I look forward to our continued close
                        cooperation. With warmest regards for the coming year.<note n="5" xml:id="d568fn5">In telegram 3793 from Brussels, December 29, <persName corresp="#p_KRB_1">Knight</persName> reported that he delivered the

                        Conversation with President <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>,
                        January 4.</p>
                    <pb n="824" facs="0857" xml:id="pg_824"/>
                    <p>1. Accompanied by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName>,
                        Van Dyk, <persName corresp="#p_HFL_1">Hadsel</persName> and McGuire, Vice
                        President met with President <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>,
                        FonMin <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName> and Vice Minister Lutete for almost
                        two and one half hours of discussion emphasizing primarily internal security
                        and economic problems. Question of evacuation of mercenaries was not
                        discussed.</p>
                    <p>2. After receiving warm welcome from President <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, <gloss target="#t_VP_1">VP</gloss> presented letter
                        from President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>, referred to
                        recent advance of the Congo in solving its problems, and assured <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> that US shared with Congolese the
                        devotion to self-determination opposition to apartheid and dedication to
                        independence and integrity of Congo nation. Commenting on presence of both
                        Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ACY_1">Adoula</persName>, he thought that both governments
                        were well served by men of exceptional competence. <gloss target="#t_VP_1">VP</gloss> recalled his own days in Senate when he had resolutely
                        supported Congo unity during early years of this nation’s life.</p>
                    <p>3. President <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> replied by
                        emphasizing not only the good relations between US and Congo but the genuine
                        American understanding of Congolese problems. He extremely grateful for the
                        help of first, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> and
                        now President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>. He wished in
                        time available for conversations to emphasize particularly two general
                        problems, internal security and economic development.</p>
                    <p>4. <gloss target="#t_Re_1">Re</gloss> internal security, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> noted that each time Congo faced
                        major crisis US had been of decisive assistance, latest example being
                        provision of the three C–130 planes to deal with mercenary rebellion. Now
                        that situation is calm, it extremely important that Congo develop its own
                        internal security, rather than wait for next crisis. He not concerned about
                        direct attack, but there are Cubans, Chinese and Russians just across the
                        river and there is serious danger of subversion. Frankly Congo still young
                        government and not prepared to prevent this kind of disruption.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> continued that there were
                        two essential problems. First, he needed C–130’s to provide mobility for
                        approximately 300 men in order that he could rapidly stop rebellious
                        activities, such as recent mercenary efforts. Problems had been studied by
                        US and details were available to General Conway of <gloss target="#t_CINCSTRIKE_1">CINCSTRIKE</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_VP_1">VP</gloss> replied that he thought Mobuto entirely correct in his
                        analysis that period of calm should be used to develop resistance against
                        subversion. It true, of course, that new Foreign Assistance Act had certain
                        restrictions on sophisticated weapons and that cut by Congress of almost one
                        billion dollars entire Act curtailed US funds available for such assistance.
                        He extremely sympathetic to concept of mobile alert force. While he could
                        not foresee exactly all aspects of problem, he promised to present case to
                        President and Dept. of Defense.</p>
                    <pb n="825" facs="0858" xml:id="pg_825"/>
                    <p>6. Secondly, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> referred to
                        ability neighboring countries to overfly Congo with impunity. He had ten or
                        twelve pilots with Soviet training, but badly needed 6 to 8 pursuit planes,
                        probably located at Kamina. With respect to type of equipment <gloss target="#t_VP_1">VP</gloss> asked, in light of aid legislation, if
                        propeller planes were appropriate. <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> nodded in affirmative but <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> replied he preferred jet aircraft.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> hoped for long term
                        purchase arrangements.</p>
                    <p>7. In elaboration on problem of internal security <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> observed that it was contrary to
                        his fundamental beliefs to play the East and West against each other. He
                        believed he should continue to work with friendly Western countries.
                        However, in recent months <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> had been
                        all smiles. Bulgaria and Romania were offering help. At this point <gloss target="#t_VP_1">VP</gloss> interjected his personal view was that the
                        Communists became “respectable” when other methods did not work. Perhaps
                        Yugoslavia and possibly Romania were all right, but others probably intended
                        subversive effort. They claim to come to raise vegetables but really raise
                        trouble. He thought European countries, Israel, Canada, etc. were more
                        likely to give genuine assistance. Perhaps in three to five years Congo
                        would be more able to deal with Communist countries with impunity.</p>
                    <p>8. During comments on security and in course of moving to economic
                        development, it recognized by both <gloss target="#t_VP_1">VP</gloss> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> that internal security
                        and economic development were inter-related. The Vice President moreover,
                        stressed the identity of purpose of the two governments in pursuing these
                        objectives.</p>
                    <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> expounded his deep desire
                        to achieve genuine economic independence. This involved economic
                        emancipation from Belgium. For example when he sought spare parts for the
                        Harley-Davidson motorcycles used in the motorcade, he had to go through
                        Brussels and could not deal directly with American company. When he bought
                        American autos for the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> conference, he
                        had to buy through Belgium and obtain cars on Belgian ships, even though
                        Belgium did not manufacture them. <gloss target="#t_VP_1">VP</gloss> replied
                        that this system made no sense. He fully agreed that Congo should have
                        direct access to American firms and that it most desirable there should be a
                        training program so Congolese could become representatives of these firms as
                        soon as possible. He promised to follow up on the study recently done under
                        the applause of the U.S. Department of Commerce to see what could be done,
                        including opening of direct U.S. sales offices in Congo and training
                        Congolese in U.S. to operate own distributionships for U.S. goods.</p>
                    <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> added that this year he
                        had declared 1968 the year of agriculture. He did not wish take the time of
                        the <gloss target="#t_VP_1">VP</gloss> to go into full details but he would
                        work with the Ambassador on this problem. The Vice President congratulated
                        him on this emphasis. He thought the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture might be able
                        to help Congolese on some of <pb n="826" facs="0859" xml:id="pg_826"/>their
                        problems by sending experts. <gloss target="#t_VP_1">VP</gloss> promised
                        that USDA would make contact.</p>
                    <p>11. The Vice President received with pleasure the news that the agreement
                        with Pan American to build a hotel had just been signed. It was very much in
                        line with his desire to encourage American capital to invest in the Congo.
                        This diversification of assistance was especially important in times when
                        official funds were restricted.</p>
                    <p>12. Vice President noted that Peace Corps volunteers for Congo had been under
                        discussion on various occasions. As Chairman of the Peace Corps Advisory
                        Council, he personally thought a US assistance of this nature would be a
                        good idea. If Congolese Government desired, he would be pleased to pursue
                        possibility in Washington.</p>
                    <p>13. The conversation concluded with renewed expression by <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> at the pleasure of receiving the
                        Vice President. The Vice President invited General <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> to accompany him to see the Lemba
                        housing project.</p>

                    <p>1. In course extensive private conversation between <gloss target="#t_VP_1">VP</gloss> and <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> (reported
                            septel)<note n="2" xml:id="d570fn2">Not found.</note> subject of
                        mercenaries discussed in some detail. Conversation developed after
                        considerable elaboration by <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                        of his basic problems of security and his intense personal desire to assure
                        genuine independence of Congo.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> recounted in detail entire
                        mercenary developments since revolt began in summer. He complained most
                        bitterly about the treatment he receiving by right-wing elements in Belgium
                        and right-wing press. He frankly recognized international problem of
                        mercenaries in that manner in which problem was solved would have bearing on
                        attitude of international problem of mercenaries in that manner <pb n="827" facs="0860" xml:id="pg_827"/>in which problem was solved would have
                        bearing on attitude of international community towards Congo. He reaffirmed
                        in staunchest fashion that he was not racist in attitude but that situation
                        rapidly developing to point where it would be impossible avoid arousing
                        emotions in Congo unless Belgian right-wing press got off his back. By
                        contrast Belgium King has written him a very good letter.</p>
                    <p>3. <gloss target="#t_VP_1">VP</gloss> recounted that Houphouet-Boigny,
                        Tubman, and Ankrah had all expressed to him their understanding for
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s dilemma but that they
                        were also concerned by international repercussions if mercenaries were
                        returned to the Congo and were tried and shot. They asked <gloss target="#t_VP_1">VP</gloss> to discuss matter with <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> within framework their sympathetic
                        concern. <gloss target="#t_VP_1">VP</gloss> said there no doubt, of course,
                        that mercenaries were criminals. However, recognizing practical problem
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> faces, both in relations
                        among Europeans and Congolese in Congo and between Congo and Europeans, we
                        wondered if we could be helpful in any way in this difficult problem.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> explained that if
                        mercenaries left Rwanda by land they would require visas from neighboring
                        African countries and if they were flown out they would require overflight
                        permission. Either would be extremely difficult for African countries to
                        permit in view record of mercenaries. As personal thought, <gloss target="#t_VP_1">VP</gloss> wondered whether mercenaries could be tried
                        in absentia. This would tell whole world about their record and would mean
                        that if mercenaries ever returned to African countries they could be
                        arrested as common criminals. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>
                        said he wished to get rid of mercenaries but not have them killed, and would
                        like to find way to be responsive to letter from Belgian King. He was
                        willing to send <gloss target="#t_FM_1">FM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> to forthcoming <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> meeting at Khartoum to try to work out
                        something. However, if right-wing Belgian press did not reduce its attacks
                        on him and his country, it would be impossible to work out satisfactory
                        solution. He urgently asked that US do whatever it could to get <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> to call off these attacks. He observed
                        that <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> often claimed to have no influence
                        with these interests but that it was not hesitant at all to exercise control
                        when it appeared really necessary.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> gave clear impression that
                        he wished solution short of return and execution of mercenaries. He was
                        eloquent about pressures on him if situation endured for long. He repeatedly
                        said that unless European press attacks stopped he would be unable, possibly
                        unwilling, to avoid emotional reaction within Congo. He very strongly hoped
                        US would be able influence <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> on this
                        matter.</p>

                    <p>99130. 1. Secretary met with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> January 15 and hosted small lunch during which
                        conversations were continued. <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> received later in afternoon by Vice President at
                        Capitol. Also met with <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName> and

                        Kinshasa as scheduled arriving January 17.</p>
                    <p>2. Following is uncleared summary of conversation with Secretary subject to
                        review. <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> discussed at some
                        length same problems <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> had
                        raised with Vice President in fields of security and economic development.
                        He followed closely lines of memorandum. He stressed need for four C–130s
                        and squadron of fighter planes. <gloss target="#t_Re_1">Re</gloss>
                        development he mentioned <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> desire to
                        have American technicians help Congolese develop projects for increasing
                        production of major crops and importance of direct US–Congo commercial
                        relations to eliminate need for Belgian middlemen.</p>
                    <p>3. Concerning mercenaries, <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName>
                        told Secretary problem no longer in Congolese hands and as far as <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> concerned issue virtually closed matter
                        which would presumably be shortly resolved. (In earlier conversation with
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJI_1">Palmer</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> had said that problem is now in
                        hands of <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> and no longer of direct
                        concern to Congo. Fact problem is now an <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> one means Congolese cannot deal directly with Rwandans and
                            <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> precluded from using force to
                        bring back mercenaries. <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> said
                        Congolese had earlier indicated to Rwandans their willingness to see all of
                        mercenaries except for handful of ring-leaders repatriated but <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> prevented from reaching any agreement
                        with Rwanda owing to Rwandan Government’s refusal to discuss matter.<note n="2" xml:id="d571fn2">On January 9, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> issued an angry denunciation of <persName corresp="#p_KGR_1">Kayibanda</persName>, labeling him a traitor to
                            Africa for refusing to extradite the mercenaries. <persName corresp="#p_KGR_1">Kayibanda</persName> responded that Rwanda was
                            sticking to the terms of the September <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> resolution. On January 11, the Congo broke diplomatic
                            relations with Rwanda and closed its border. Rwanda followed suit,
                            saying it had no choice but to respond to Congolese provocation.</note>
                        Congo interest in matter now terminated and country turning its attention to
                        problems of economic development.)</p>
                    <p>4. Secretary indicated our understanding of issues presented and our desire
                        to be helpful. He pointed out however many problems connected with
                        acquisition of sophisticated aircraft, and need for having <pb n="829" facs="0862" xml:id="pg_829"/>military experts give careful study to best
                        ways of coping with Congo’s security needs.</p>
                    <p>5. During discussion with Vice President, <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> raised security and economic development matters but
                        did not touch on mercenaries. Discussion was extremely friendly and Vice
                        President indicated US interest in assisting Congo with problems presented
                        by <persName corresp="#p_BJU_1">Bomboko</persName> but made no commitments
                        other than to emphasize our willingness to look into matters and to seek
                        ways of meeting very real needs of Congo in these fields.</p>

                    <p>1. Dept encouraged by developments reported Nairobi 3923 and Kinshasa 8301 to

                        may now be in sight. We continue believe however that evacuation is

                    <p>2. We concur completely with Kinshasa’s point (para 2 Kinshasa 8313) that we
                        should not give Europeans any reason believe that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> willing get them off hook at last moment by providing
                        airlift and therefore believe it important that Hoffman be set straight

                    <p>3. Accordingly wherever Hoffman next surfaces, Embassy concerned should 1)
                        indicate awareness Hoffman inquiry about possible use C–130, and 2) tell
                        Hoffman that any such request should come to us through <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> headquarters Geneva but that if he is
                        thinking of making such a recommendation to Geneva, he should know that

                    <p>1. On 2 April 1968, Mr. John McKesson, Director of the Office of Central

                        State, asked me for a briefing on <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                        covert funding of Congolese political figures.</p>
                    <p>2. I told him that such funding was now limited to [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>], [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>], [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity

                        He asked whether [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] was still
                        receiving such funds. I said that he had received <pb n="831" facs="0864" xml:id="pg_831"/> no funds since September 1966. I explained that the

                        Committee (in February 1966) was that each month he asked for funds ([<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]) and that once the
                        Embassy and the Department had given its approval, the Station made the
                        payment. Mr. McKesson expressed surprise at the size of the payment and
                        asked what [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] did with the
                        money. I said that the funding had been proposed by the Station and the
                        Ambassador to assist [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] in
                        making the gifts and payments to leading supporters (Army officers,
                        politicians, provincial leaders) expected of an African political leader, at
                        a time when [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] had seemed the
                        best hope for the preservation of a stable, Western-oriented government in
                        the Congo. [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] had never asked
                        for a payment after September 1966, probably because he suspected that after
                        his having virtually compelled the Department’s withdrawal of the
                        Ambassador, his request would not have been acceded to.</p>

                    </opener>
                    <p>I thought you’d want to know that a stormy chapter has quietly closed in the
                        Congo. Yesterday morning, under an <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> deal
                        with the Red Cross, the 120 white mercenaries interned in Rwanda were
                        finally evacuated to Europe. They flew out in two chartered planes—one to
                        Belgium, the other to Switzerland with a stop in Italy.</p>
                    <p>We don’t know all the details of the evacuation. Our people stayed strictly
                        out of the way while the Africans bargained with the Red Cross. But it’s
                        been plain for weeks that everybody concerned, including <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, was tired of haggling and just
                        wanted to be done with it.</p>
                    <pb n="832" facs="0865" xml:id="pg_832"/>
                    <p>You may recall that the sticking point was the Congolese demand for some
                        assurance from the parent countries (mainly Belgium, France, and South
                        Africa) that the mercenaries wouldn’t return. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> apparently got some vague promises to this effect and
                        let it go at that.</p>
                    <p>The job now is to get the Congolese back to serious business in development.
                        No one is betting we’ve seen the last of these mercenary adventures or that
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> will have an easy time
                        holding the country together even without outside interference. But at least
                        we’ve bought some more time; for the Congo, that’s worth celebrating.<note n="2" xml:id="d574fn2">A note at the bottom of the original in <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>’s handwriting reads: “For

                    </list>
                    <p>1. On 8 March 1967 the 303 Committee directed that Project [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] be liquidated as soon as possible
                        “with minimum sacrifice to efficiency and order”. On 10 May 1967 the
                        Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo signed a contract with
                            [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>], the maintenance
                        facility set up under Project [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not
                            declassified</hi>] to retain it as the maintenance facility for the
                        Congolese Air Force.</p>
                    <p>2. Before Project [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] was in
                        fact liquidated, a mutiny of white mercenaries and Katangan gendarmes broke
                        out in the Congo on 5 July 1967. Congolese forces were unable to control the
                        mutiny and in response to a request from the Congolese Government that the
                        United States provide pilots for the Congolese Air Force, the 303 <pb n="833" facs="0866" xml:id="pg_833"/>Committee directed that Project
                            [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] be extended for the
                        period 1 July 1967 to 31 December 1967.</p>
                    <p>3. The pilots provided under the Project left the Congo before the end of the
                        extension period. The air operations officers connected with the Project
                        departed in February 1968 after the final inventories of equipment were made
                        and the departure of a plane supplied for Project use was arranged.</p>
                    <p>4. All Project contract personnel have been amicably terminated and have
                        signed quitclaims; there are no residual problems relating to personnel.</p>
                    <p>5. A considerable amount of material supplied by the Project is presently in
                        the Congo under the control of [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not
                            declassified</hi>]; the appropriate offices of <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> are presently negotiating with [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym
                            not declassified</hi>] to arrange its final disposition as per the
                        attached memorandum.<note n="2" xml:id="d575fn2">Not printed.</note> (The
                        disposition of this material is not considered an impediment to the
                        termination of the Project.)</p>
                    <p>6. It is therefore requested that approval be given for the termination of
                        Project [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>].</p>

                        recommend a $15 million Supporting Assistance Loan for the Congo. Joe Fowler
                        concurs. Added to <pb n="834" facs="0867" xml:id="pg_834"/>the $13 million
                        PL–480 sales you approved in December, this loan would complete our aid
                        package for the Congo in <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1968.</p>
                    <p>The loan will finance imports of U.S. vehicles, machinery, and spare parts.
                        This is primarily a maintenance loan, not a development loan. But President
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> is making a serious
                        effort to get back to the development business after the mercenary escapades
                        of last summer and fall. He has taken much needed monetary reforms
                        recommended by the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> and is working hard
                        to control an unruly budget. Our past aid has given us considerable leverage
                        in urging reforms. We would release this loan in two installments, making
                        the second contingent upon a further show of responsibility on the monetary
                        front.</p>
                    <p>Other donors (mainly Belgium, France and the EEC) provide 80% of current aid
                        to the Congo. Our share is now down to 20% and will decrease further next
                        year. (Last year’s loan was $17 million.) This proposal represents the
                        minimum we can get away with if the Congolese balance of payments is to hold
                        together.</p>
                    <p>There is no current problem in the Congo with the Conte–Long Amendment, which
                        requires us to deduct economic aid in the amount spent by a poor country on
                        sophisticated weapons. The Congolese haven’t made any such purchases so far,
                        but they have been considering buying some Italian jet trainers. We are
                        trying to head this off, and we would warn <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> that buying jets would cost him part of this

                    <p>10953. Subject: <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and the gold
                        bed syndrome.</p>
                    <p>1. It seemed prudent at this time to warn the Department of the galloping
                        onset of the gold bed syndrome in conduct of President <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>. During my absence on leave, this
                        phenomenon which is never far from the surface in Congolese public figures,
                        came on apace.</p>
                    <p>2. In first instance it has manifested itself in a development of grandeur
                        which, while not wholly unamusing and vaguely and perhaps deliberately
                        reminiscent of a figure on the banks of a more northern river called the
                        Seine, is hardly appropriate to the harsh realities of even a relatively
                        peaceful Congo.</p>
                    <p>3. The most spectacular instance of folly so far reported was mentioned to me
                        with fascinated horror by <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss>
                        representative Dini who was told by <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> that latter had been so impressed by Rome that he was
                        planning to build a replica of St. Peters in Kinshasa. While Dini was still
                        reeling, he added it would be better to build three replicas so Kisangani
                        and Lubumbashi could also have one each.</p>
                    <p>4. Douglas Aircraft representatives inform us categorically that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has purchased a BAC–111 aircraft
                        for private Presidential use which British Ambassador states will cost two

                        parts. Neighbors of President on Mount Stanley report conversations with
                        Belgian gardeners concerning five-million dollar Versailles-like parks. <hi rend="italic">Der Spiegel</hi> and other European magazines have heavily
                        publicized President’s purchase of a luxury villa near Lausanne for one
                        million Swiss francs.</p>
                    <p>5. Dewilde of <gloss target="#t_IBRD_1">IBRD</gloss> who is now here is
                        appalled at Presidential expenditures. Unfortunately <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> seems to have lost touch with
                        reality and economics, never a strong suit of the President’s, seems to have
                        flown out the window.</p>
                    <p>6. I believe there is nothing which can be done to restrain these frivolous
                        Presidential expenditures because <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has apparently risen in souffle-like grandiloquence.
                        I feel that to call his attention to the dangers of this type of thing
                        although his budget expenses have already risen more than fifty percent over
                        what was foreseen, would be to incur instant wrath.</p>

                    <p>7. However, I felt a brief report should be made on his regrettable
                        phenomenon because I believe it is the most serious problem facing Congo at
                        present time and the fault is that of the President and the uncontrollable
                        spending is emanating directly from him. Furthermore, it occurred to me this
                        might have an effect on US policies towards the present regime in the

                    <p>1. President <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has on several
                        occasions since mid-August requested <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                        financial assistance for his current efforts to encourage moderate military
                        leaders in Congo (Brazzaville) to neutralize radical leftist influences in
                        that country as well as eliminate the Chinese Communist presence. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has become increasingly insistent
                        in these requests and expresses emphatic disappointment that no <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> financial assistance has been forthcoming.

                            [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] be made
                        available to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> for the purpose
                        of preserving and enhancing the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>’s
                        future relations with <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> and

                    <p>3. It should be noted that Kinshasa [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not

                            [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] contacts,
                        provided the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> with accurate advance
                        information on political developments in Brazzaville, including the armed
                        conflict of 30–31 August, and on <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s activities vis-à-vis the situation.</p>
                    <p>4. The Bureau of African Affairs and the Central Intelligence Agency jointly
                        concur in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName>’s
                        recommendation that [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>]
                        be made available to President <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> for the reasons discussed below. [<hi rend="italic">2½ lines not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>5. There are basically two issues involved in this request. One is the
                        desirability of lessening Chinese and/or Cuban influence in Congo (B), the
                        other the possible impact on US–Congo (K) relations of a failure to be
                        responsive to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>.</p>
                    <p>a. Of itself, the lessening of <gloss target="#t_Chicom_1">Chicom</gloss>
                        influence in this volatile part of Africa is a desirable goal through the
                        elimination or curtailment of communist influence in Congo (B) and of
                        communist opportunities to use Congo (B) as an operations base for
                        activities elsewhere. This is a matter of deep concern to Congo (K), whose
                        internal security has frequently been menaced by threats orchestrated from
                        abroad using nearby bases. For this reason, it is also of concern to the
                            <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> in pursuance of its policy to aid
                        Congo (K) in combatting these threats.</p>
                    <p>b. The second problem, namely <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>,
                        is complex. He is the ultimate source of power in Congo (K) and ready access
                        to him is vital if we hope to continue our long-standing policy of assisting
                        the Congo to unity, stability and economic progress, with the eventual goal
                        of seeing a stable, western-oriented government in the heart of Africa,
                        capable of exercising important influence not only in the general area of
                        Central Africa, but in the Africa-wide councils as well. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has asked for our support, rightly
                        or wrongly on the assumption that the interests of the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> in Congo (B) approximate his own. He is an
                        emotional man, and a proud man. Recently he has shown a proclivity towards
                        adventure outside of Congo (K) borders, not all of which are necessarily
                        well-conceived. If he feels he has been let down on this issue of Congo <pb n="838" facs="0871" xml:id="pg_838"/>(B), he is quite capable of
                        translating his annoyance into a broad spectrum of issues not related to the
                        immediate problem of Congo (B).</p>
                    <p>6. We do not wish to risk the impairment of access to him which if it
                        occurred would very probably be carried over into contacts throughout the
                        Congolese Government [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>], access to the Foreign Minister and access to a
                        number of government contacts on the economic side whom we consider
                        important for the orderly conduct of our day-to-day relationships and the
                        ultimate achievement of our goals. Impairment of access would also risk a
                        serious adverse impact on our ability to exercise leverage on <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>. This applies immediately to his
                        role vis-à-vis Congo (B). It may also apply, however, to other matters of
                        importance to us, both in the foreign and domestic areas. The potential
                        depth of such a development is difficult to judge. It might only be
                        transitory. We would prefer it not occur at all, especially when the
                        immediate issue of Congo (B) is one to which we are favorably disposed. It
                        is clear from <gloss target="#t_Amb_1">Amb</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName>’s cables that this aspect and the
                        potential danger of a developing strain in US–Congo relations and in his own
                        relations with <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, weigh heavily
                        on his mind.</p>

                    <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                    <p>A. President <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Joseph Mobutu</persName> is
                        currently providing a greater measure of political stability and internal
                        security to Congo (Kinshasa) than that troubled country has known since
                        independence. But the fabric of government is still fragile. There are
                        persistent popular discontents and frustrations, and no great enthusiasm for
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> personally. The
                        opposition to the regime is, however, diffuse and unorganized. We think
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> stands a better than even
                        chance of retaining office over the next couple of years, and perhaps
                        longer. His departure, if sudden, would probably result in prolonged
                        political turmoil and a sharp decline in internal security.</p>
                    <p>B. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s main base of support is
                        the Congolese National Army (<gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>), which
                        holds a virtual monopoly of coercive power but is poorly trained and
                        disciplined and often is as much a threat to, as a preserver of, security.
                        Any significant improvement in the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> is
                        likely to be gradual and could take many years.</p>
                    <p>C. The obstacles to a restoration of the economy to preindependence levels of
                        activity are great. If tolerable internal security can be maintained,
                        monetary stability preserved, and foreign aid at about current rates
                        obtained, the Congo will probably be able to function for some time at about
                        the present pace. A considerable improvement in the economy would require a
                        substantial additional input of foreign financing, much of it for the
                        infrastructure.</p>
                    <p>D. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has recently shown a
                        tendency to involve himself in the internal affairs of his neighbors. After
                        a period of acrimony, Belgian-Congolese relations are improving, and
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> will probably gain
                        limited economic and technical benefits from the détente. Belgium will
                        remain the predominant foreign presence in the Congo, although it is
                        unlikely to be as deeply involved in internal affairs as in the past.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> will continue to look to
                        the US for important military and economic <pb n="840" facs="0873" xml:id="pg_840"/> assistance and unless US aid is cut off, he will
                        regard the US as his main foreign backer.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. The Political Order</p>
                    <p>1. Considering the Congo’s chaotic history since 1960, President <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Joseph Mobutu</persName> in his three years in office
                        has had some modest achievements. A major accomplishment has been the mere
                        survival of his regime, which owes something to the exhaustion of the
                        Congolese populace after the prolonged civil strife and to the continued
                        disarray of rival political factions, and a good deal to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s political skills.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s regime, like many others
                        in Africa, is characterized by a heavy concentration of authority in the
                        hands of the President. Remnants of earlier regimes, including national and
                        provincial assemblies, have been swept away in favor of a highly personal
                        style of rule virtually devoid of an institutional framework. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> shares power with no one, but he
                        does consult with his old cronies, a group of seasoned and durable
                        politicians known as the Binza Group. This clique forms the core of his
                        cabinet and serves in a few other key administrative posts. None of his
                        civilian associates are in a position to challenge him, and all are kept off
                        balance by cabinet changes and administrative reshuffles.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has invested time, money,
                        and effort in bolstering his stature as a great national chief—both by
                        displaying the trappings of office (e.g., a yacht, prestige projects) and,
                        more importantly, by being ruthless and decisive. He has shown some response
                        to advice from the International Monetary Fund (<gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss>) and the US designed to introduce greater financial
                        responsibility. He has also made efforts to grapple with basic internal
                        problems. He keeps in touch with the grassroots by holding informal palavers
                        with groups of clergy, students, labor, businessmen, the army, and others
                        who air their grievances and recommend reforms. He has also established a
                        national political party and has included in it some regional politicians
                        who had been largely excluded from active politics since his takeover. This
                        party is, however, principally an instrument of the regime, and provides a
                        means of dispensing patronage and a cheering section.</p>
                    <p>4. The capabilities of the central administration in Kinshasa have probably
                        improved slowly under <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>.
                        Control of the provinces is probably stronger than under previous regimes.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> selects provincial
                        governors—a fairly competent group on the whole—gives them vice-regal
                        powers, shifts them about, and makes it a practice to send them to areas
                        where they are not native. But this has not necessarily improved provincial
                        government, for the governors frequently lack the expertise, the staffs, and
                        the resources to deal with the complexities of <pb n="841" facs="0874" xml:id="pg_841"/>local situations. Moreover, the governors often do not
                        know the local languages and are regarded as foreigners by the local
                        populace. Corruption, though less flagrant than in earlier regimes, is
                        widespread and has a debilitating effect in the provinces as in the
                        capital.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s principal base of support
                        is the Congolese National Army (<gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>), an
                        organization that is feared and generally hated. Some of the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>’s unpopularity rubs off on the President.
                        He lacks a firm tribal base and is unable to arouse much enthusiasm for
                        himself or his policies. Urban wage-earners, suffering from inflation,
                        grumble at their lot and some resent <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s lavish personal outlays. Many university students
                        are opposed to him, criticize his policies as pro-Western and too moderate,
                        resent his reliance on advisers whom they consider out of tune with the
                        needs of the Congo, and fear that their ambitions for positions of influence
                        will be thwarted. He, in turn, has used the army to put down student
                        demonstrations. The young intellectual elite at one time welcomed <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> as a nationalist innovator, and
                        some have lost the important posts they held in the early days of his
                        regime, and have become disillusioned and estranged. In addition, some of
                        the Congo’s most important tribes, e.g., Bakongo, Baluba, and Balunda, feel
                        excluded from what they regard as their rightful share of jobs and
                        benefits.</p>
                    <p>6. There is, however, a considerable difference between the kind of chronic
                        discontent which is prevalent among most Congolese, and active dissidence.
                        Tolerance for corruption, maladministration, and economic failure is high.
                        Moreover, dissatisfied urban masses as well as most of the people in the
                        interior are unlikely to revolt so long as they believe that the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> would move against them. Thus far, popular
                        discontent and frustration, though persistent, is unorganized and is mainly
                        confined to unarmed civilian elements without allies in the army. Generally
                        speaking, the survival of <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s
                        regime is likely to depend largely on the action or inaction of the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> at critical moments.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Internal Security</p>
                    <p>7. The <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> holds a virtual monopoly of
                        coercive power in the Congo, but it is a poorly trained and disciplined
                        force and is militarily unreliable. Throughout much of the country, it is as
                        much a threat to security as a preserver of order. Soldiers often set up
                        roadblocks to “tax” travelers, and there are frequent instances in which
                        they beat and rob the populace. Many of the officers line their pockets by
                        organizing rackets. Nevertheless, the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>
                        generally keeps the provinces under a rough kind of control.</p>
                    <p>8. No major security problems currently confront the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>. There are some pockets of rebels in the eastern Congo and
                        in the forests of <pb n="842" facs="0875" xml:id="pg_842"/>Bandundu
                        Province, but these groups act more like bandits than insurgents and tend to
                        avoid contact with the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>. There is no
                        evidence of any significant resurgence of politically-inspired dissidence
                        which could touch off a new revolt against the government. The rebel leaders
                        have mostly fled the country and have little contact with their former
                        followers in the bush. While some of them are in countries east of the Congo
                        and may have some Cuban or Chinese support, they are at odds with each other
                        and appear to pose little threat of renewed insurgency.</p>
                    <p>9. The question of the loyalty of the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> to
                        the regime and its responsiveness to orders from headquarters or field
                        commanders are key considerations in assessing the political stability of
                        the Congo. Officers and men are paid regularly and <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> is responsive to their grievances.
                        Under these circumstances the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> is
                        reasonably loyal. Though <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> came
                        to power in 1965 through a military coup, he has carefully excluded the army
                        from participation in government. The top positions in the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> are largely filled with long-time
                        associates of <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, who are for
                        the most part incompetent, corrupt, and lazy, but are probably more loyal
                        than the younger officers. The latter, particularly those trained abroad,
                        are far more capable and many are thoroughly disgusted at serving under
                        ignorant and corrupt commanders, but they are not a cohesive group and there
                        is little evidence of plotting against <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>.</p>
                    <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> probably wishes to reform
                        the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> but he recognizes that any major
                        shakeup might arouse enough discontent among the older group of officers to
                        threaten the stability of the government. He is therefore more likely to
                        tackle the army problem piecemeal through limited and step-by-step
                        reorganizations and reassignments rather than a clean sweep. The foreign
                        training programs will bring some improvement of the capabilities of some
                        units, but it would be unrealistic to expect any significant progress in the
                        discipline, capabilities, or responsiveness of the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> in the next several years.</p>
                    <p>11. The national police also has a security role, primarily in the cities.
                        There are several foreign training programs under way, including one
                        supported by the US, and the police force is in general a bit better
                        disciplined than the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>. It also has
                        better relations with the populace. In times of emergency (as during the
                        mercenary revolt in 1967) it is subject to the authority of the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>12. The fact remains that the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> is both
                        the main bulwark of the regime and the greatest potential threat to it.
                        Indeed, the most likely challenge to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> would come from within the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> or from a combination of military and civilian dissidents.
                        So long as he holds the allegiance of the bulk of the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss>, particularly the “elite” First
                        Paracommandos in the capital, he is not likely to be overthrown except by
                        assassination. But there is no assurance that even the elite troops would
                            <pb n="843" facs="0876" xml:id="pg_843"/>stand their ground if
                        confronting an armed and determined opposition. It is difficult to estimate
                        political stability in the Congo with any confidence because in the past the
                        shift from apathy to violence has been abrupt, and major uprisings have
                        stemmed from trivial or unforeseen incidents. But there is currently no
                        indication that <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> is heading
                        for serious trouble. On balance, we think he stands a better than even
                        chance of retaining office over the next couple of years, and perhaps
                        longer.</p>
                    <p>13. If <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> were removed from the
                        scene in the near future, it would probably destroy the relative stability
                        and order now prevalent. Any successor, military or civilian, would have to
                        have the backing of the <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> or most
                        elements of it simply to hold office. Moreover, because of the highly
                        personal autocratic type of rule employed by <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, the whole structure of government would be shaken.
                        His successor would probably have to start from scratch, either to fashion a
                        new hierarchy based on personal loyalties, or to begin to construct some
                        institutions of government. In either case there would probably be prolonged
                        confusion and instability.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. The Economy</p>
                    <p>14. The overriding economic problem of the Congo has been to halt the
                        downward slide which began just before independence. The natural resources
                        of the country are enormous, but so are the obstacles to their exploitation.
                        Post-independence governments have proved unable to muster the
                        administrative skills needed to operate a complicated and extensive economy.
                        Rebellion, civil disorder, and neglect have hampered production,
                        particularly on plantations, and have also taken a heavy toll of the
                        transport system. Bridges were destroyed, equipment rusted, channels silted,
                        and roads overgrown; reconstruction and repairs have been slow. This is an
                        important factor in a country where the principal mines and the most
                        potentially productive plantations lie some 900 miles from the seaports
                        through which much of their output must move. Finally, in the years
                        immediately preceding the devaluation of June 1967, the currency was grossly
                        overvalued; this dampened the incentive to produce, not only for export but
                        for the domestic market as well.</p>
                    <p>15. In consequence, current agricultural production is less than half the
                        preindependence level, with cotton, rice, and corn from small farms
                        suffering the most. As for minerals, the output of gold and tin suffered
                        substantial losses. Diamond production was less affected, but a third of the
                        output was smuggled out of the country, thus depriving the government of
                        revenue. A new marketing structure for diamonds has served to cut down this
                        smuggling, and the prospects for both the mineral and the agricultural
                        sectors have been improved by the 1967 monetary reform.</p>
                    <pb n="844" facs="0877" xml:id="pg_844"/>
                    <p>16. Probably the brightest spot in the economic picture is the continued high
                        output of copper, zinc, and cobalt from Katanga. Exports of these minerals
                        have been maintained at about preindependence levels; indeed, copper exports
                        in 1967 exceeded those in 1959, and are rising. Katangan minerals now
                        account for some 80 percent in value of all Congolese exports, and the
                        revenues derived from minerals provide half of government income. Yet
                        revenues have been affected by the drop in copper prices which have fallen
                        from a high of 70 cents a pound in early 1968 to about 45 cents. Prices are
                        unlikely to rise much in the next few years, and may drop further.</p>
                    <p>17. A complicating factor in the effort to arrest the economic decline is the
                        national financial situation. Years of deficit spending after independence
                        disrupted commerce and hastened inflation. The country has been kept going
                        only by the infusion of over $1 billion in economic and military assistance,
                        60 percent of it from the US much of it through the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>.<note n="2" xml:id="d579fn2">Roughly $700 million was
                            economic assistance; the US accounted for about one-half. [Footnote in
                            the original.]</note> Last year the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss>
                        sponsored a sweeping monetary reform. By-and-large the reform has worked,
                        partly because high world copper prices provided a windfall in revenues.
                        Furthermore, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has taken steps
                        to strengthen the Finance Ministry. But the recent downturn in copper prices
                        and the uncertain outlook for efforts to control governmental expenditures,
                        including <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s propensity for
                        lavish personal and prestige spending, are likely to raise again the spectre
                        of budgetary deficits and perhaps another round of financial
                        instability.</p>
                    <p>18. Over the years the US has delivered far more economic and military
                        assistance to the Congo than to any other sub-Saharan African country. In
                        the last few years the levels of aid have fallen off, amounting in fiscal
                        year 1968 to only $2.4 million in military assistance and $30 million in
                        economic aid.<note n="3" xml:id="d579fn3">This compares with US economic and

                            $32 million in 1965; $64 million in 1964; $112 million in 1963; $129
                            million in 1962; and $144 million in 1961. [Footnote in the
                            original.]</note> This included $12 million in PL 480 commodities. The
                        balance financed imports of trucks, spare parts, and industrial supplies.
                        Continued US aid at about this level, together with Belgian and other
                        foreign financial and technical assistance, would probably maintain economic
                        activity at something like the current pace, provided there is no serious
                        decline in internal security, no major deterioration of the monetary
                        situation, and no substantial decrease in the number of expatriate
                        specialists.</p>
                    <p>19. A program designed to regain the pre-1960 level of economic activity
                        would require massive financing over five years or so. It has <pb n="845" facs="0878" xml:id="pg_845"/>been estimated that at least $175 million
                        would be needed to restore the internal transport system alone. An
                        additional sum of at least $125 million would be required to provide other
                        public services. Some outside aid, though far short of the magnitude
                        required for such a program, could be expected from Belgium, the EEC, the
                            <gloss target="#t_IBRD_1">IBRD</gloss>, and other sources, but they as
                        well as the Congolese would look to the US for a major contribution. The
                        success of such a program would depend heavily on the preservation of
                        internal security and political stability, and on the related matter of
                        finding the necessary technical and managerial personnel. Foreign experts
                        willing to work in the bush are hard to find, and the Congolese now being
                        trained for specialized jobs will not be available in sufficient numbers for
                        a decade or more. If these requirements could be largely met, foreign
                        private investors might come forward with the funds to exploit the great
                        natural resources of the country. The economy could then even exceed
                        preindependence levels of activity.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. Foreign Relations</p>
                    <p>20. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> has entered into African
                        diplomatic affairs in a rather erratic and occasionally enthusiastic
                        fashion. He clearly relishes attendance at <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> summit gatherings, where he mingles with other African
                        chiefs in prestigious surroundings. Though he has little interest in more
                        distant parts of Africa, such as Nigeria, he seems to be acquiring a taste
                        for becoming involved in the affairs of his neighbors. He has come to
                        believe that the Congo, as a major African state, has an important role to
                        play in central Africa. For a time he lavished attention on the Union des
                        Etats de l’Afrique Centrale (<gloss target="#t_UEAC_1">UEAC</gloss>), and
                        embryo customs union joining Congo (Kinshasa) with Chad and Central African
                        Republic, though more recently he seems to find Congo (Brazzaville) politics
                        more interesting. We do not know at this stage whether <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s involvement in the activities of
                        neighboring states is a passing fancy or a new phase of foreign policy. We
                        are inclined to believe it is the latter.</p>
                    <p>21. Congolese relations with Portugal, though normally bad, tend to fluctuate
                        between inactivity and the trading of threats. For some years various
                        Congolese governments have afforded training facilities and safe haven to
                        Holden Roberto’s Angolan liberation movement, but <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>, like most Congolese, is not deeply
                        committed to the liberation cause. He is aware, moreover, that the
                        Portuguese have the means and occasionally the will to retaliate against the
                        Congo. He has not forgotten the brief foray of mercenaries from Angola into
                        Katanga last year, and has been concerned about bands of Lunda tribesmen
                        from Katanga now in Angola, which he believed were armed and held in
                        readiness by the Portuguese. By-and-large, neither <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> nor the Portuguese are keen on
                        worsening relations with each other. The <pb n="846" facs="0879" xml:id="pg_846"/>Congo depends on the Benguela railroad through Angola
                        for the export of Katangan copper, and Angola benefits from the
                        revenues.</p>
                    <p>22. The Soviet diplomatic mission in Kinshasa, which recently opened for the
                        third time, has been very careful in its relations with <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>. Neither trusts the other. It is
                        doubtful that the Soviets really expect to develop close relations with
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s regime. They are likely
                        to offer some aid, and <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> will
                        find the Soviet presence useful in his efforts to garner more aid from the
                        West. If he fails to get particularly desired items such as military
                        aircraft from the West he might turn to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>23. Relations with the Belgians are particularly important for the Congo.
                        After several years of acrimony, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> is now doing what he can to increase Belgian aid and
                        investment. He seems to have learned that no other country or group of
                        countries can replace Belgium, and that the prolonged absence of key Belgian
                        technicians has damaged the Congolese economy and public services. He is
                        therefore willing to risk some domestic displeasure including charges of
                        neocolonialist collaboration in order to regain the services of Belgian
                        specialists and lure Belgian capital back to the Congo.</p>
                    <p>24. The outlook for the next year or two is for cautiously forthcoming
                        response to <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s overtures.
                        Brussels wants good relations and will continue to provide at least
                        technical assistance but will not quickly forget <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s anti-Belgian campaigns of recent
                        years. Belgian aid has consisted principally of payments on preindependence
                        Congolese debt ($21 million in 1967) and the furnishing of technical
                        assistance ($25 million in 1967). The number of Belgian technicians dropped
                        sharply in 1967 but is now beginning to increase. Belgian private investors
                        will react cautiously to begin with and look for quick returns. Investors
                        will, however, wish expatriate personnel to manage investments and the
                        degree of security and stability throughout the country will be an important
                        factor in determining the availability of such personnel. If relations
                        continue to improve and the Congo maintains reasonable stability, there will
                        probably be some new investment, although mainly for the expansion of
                        existing enterprises rather than the establishment of new ones.</p>
                    <p>25. With the disappearance of the mercenaries and the liquidation of the
                        issues revolving about the role of Union Minière du Haut Katanga (<gloss target="#t_UMHK_1">UMHK</gloss>), two of the principal sources of
                        friction between the two countries subsided. Belgium has, however, to a
                        considerable extent disentangled itself from the Congo and is unlikely to be
                        as deeply involved in internal Congolese affairs as in the past.
                        Nevertheless, Belgium will remain as the major foreign presence in the
                        Congo.</p>
                    <p>26. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s attitude toward the
                        former metropole could change suddenly as it has in the past. It is always
                        possible, therefore, that for <pb n="847" facs="0880" xml:id="pg_847"/>fairly obscure reasons or simply to divert popular discontent from
                        himself, he might launch another hate campaign that would endanger the lives
                        of the 24,000 Belgians in the Congo. In these circumstances other Europeans
                        and US citizens would also be in danger.</p>
                    <p>27. The US enjoys a high degree of prestige and influence in Kinshasa, based
                        in part on the massive aid provided over the years and on a long working
                        association of US officials with <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>. The <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> relies on
                        the US for transport equipment and for some technical training, and the
                        Congolese economy would be in worse shape than it is without US assistance.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> believes that his
                        policies in the Congo and in Africa correspond with those of the US and he
                        is occasionally miffed when the US fails to provide funds for his pet
                        projects. <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> would like the US
                        to provide him with some jet aircraft and eventually a few transport planes
                        to move <gloss target="#t_ANC_1">ANC</gloss> units more rapidly to remote
                        trouble spots. In any future crisis, as in the past, he would almost
                        certainly turn first to the US for military assistance. Unless US aid ceases
                        altogether, <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName> will continue to
                        regard the US as his most important foreign backer.</p>

                    <p>You asked about the prospect of a donors club for the Congo now that her
                        worst birth pangs (hopefully) are over. <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>
                        is already well at work on this one.</p>
                    <p>Over the last few months, we’ve begun to lay the foundations of a Congo aid
                        group/consortium under the aegis of the World Bank. The first step, of
                        course, was to get the Bank itself involved. They’re now ready to begin
                        their first two jobs in the Congo: (a) a management study of a vital
                        water-rail network, and (b) through the <gloss target="#t_UNDP_1">UNDP</gloss> a badly needed <pb n="848" facs="0881" xml:id="pg_848"/>study to reorganize the Congo’s moribund Bureau of Public Roads. <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> is working closely with Bank experts on
                        both these projects. We’re telling them that we plan to support their
                        efforts directly with an <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> ’70 program loan
                        in transportation (the first sector loan in Sub-Saharan Africa). Even at
                        this early stage it seems clear the Bank is settling itself into a crucial
                        and long-range problem of Congolese development.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> has also moved on to the second step and
                        asked the Bank to call a meeting in the next 30 days of the other donors:
                        Belgium, Italy, Israel, Nationalist China, France and the EEC. This session
                        will be only a beginning at the staff level, but at least it ought to: (1)
                        get better coordination of current aid; (2) generally promote the Bank’s
                        involvement and leadership; and (3) signal the Congolese that this is the
                        way their benefactors are moving. Soundings tell us that all the donors are
                        for a Bank-sponsored group—except possibly the French, whose aid share and
                        influence are not large enough to kill the idea if they balk. The Congolese
                        think the idea is their ticket to the big leagues in development.</p>
                    <p>As you well know, the consortium-building business can be slow, hard work.
                        But most of us think these are real beginnings. The U.S. now does roughly
                        15–20 percent of the Congo’s aid bill. By 1970, with a consortium full
                        grown, we would expect our share to drop and level off at a respectable 10
                        percent.</p>
                    <p>I’ll be following the <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> talks with the
                        World Bank and the results of the meeting of the donors. If that session
                        turns out as well as expected, you might want to give the President an
                        incidental report on the Congo aid picture. After all, it’s a long and
                        heartening road from Stanleyville paradrop to a club of investors putting
                        their chips on Congolese turnpikes.</p>

                    <p>1. [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] granted [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] an interview on 21 November,
                        1968 which lasted approximately two hours and which was held at the
                        Presidency on Mount Stanley. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            2</persName>] and [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] also attended.
                        After some introductory remarks by [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            1</persName>], [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] did
                        nearly all the talking. Incidentally, it is extremely unusual for [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] to grant such a long interview to
                        anyone, even to a “personalite de marque.” [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] was extremely frank, although some of the remarks
                        which he expressed were, in several instances, biaised or erroneous (i.e. he
                        described the World Bank as by-and-large US dominated and controlled. He
                        also exaggerated the evils of the Union Minière du Haut Katanga (<gloss target="#t_UMHK_1">UMHK</gloss>) describing its 300 Belgian executives
                        as the worst type of neo-colonialists who perpetually connive against the
                        GRDC and its leadership).</p>
                    <p>2. After a brief exchange of social amenities, [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] expressed his appreciation for the interview. He
                        made it clear that the primary purpose of his visit to Africa, including
                        Congo (Kinshasa), was to brief himself on the prevailing political scene. It
                        was not his purpose to negotiate or provide any kind of support for projects
                        or programs. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] mentioned
                        that he would be called upon, shortly after his return to [U.S.] to brief
                        certain key members of the new incoming administration on matters having to
                        do with Africa.</p>
                    <p>3. At this juncture, [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] began
                        his lengthy expose of Congolese political developments from Independence.
                        The following covers the highlights of his remarks:</p>
                    <p>A. [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] expressed his
                        appreciation of past American interest in and support for the Congo dating
                        back to the <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> Administration.
                        He emphasized that the US Government had contributed materially and
                        significantly to the achievement and maintenance of Congolese independence.
                            [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] went on to explain that
                        he and his associates had been faced by powerful opponents both from the
                        right and the left. He mentioned that threats to security still existed
                        primarily <pb n="850" facs="0883" xml:id="pg_850"/>from external elements
                        supported by subversive African and Communist States. He expressed the hope
                        that the US would continue to take a major interest in the Congo adding that
                        what was primarily needed from the US at this time was sympathy,
                        understanding and economic rather than military support. He intimated that
                        he wanted to avoid being too dependent on the Belgians.</p>
                    <p>B. [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] said that relations with
                        some of the previous [U.S.] Ambassadors had not been ideal. He specifically
                        mentioned [Mc-Bride’s] predecessor who had on several occasions insisted
                        (i.e. exige) that [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] undertake
                        certain initiatives in keeping with [<gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>]
                        desires, rather than those in Congo’s best interest. He stated that as a
                        sovereign state the <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> could not and
                        would not take dictation from anyone, including [<gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>] and that this should be clearly understood by one and
                        all.</p>
                    <p>C. [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] then addressed his
                        remarks to the Belgians. He stated that the rightist Belgian threat (i.e.
                        mercenaries) has been overcome and hopefully for good. He stressed, however,
                        that <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> was still constantly being
                        threatened with domination by Belgian economic interests. He decried the
                        actual situation in the Congo whereby Belgian subsidiaries of US firms
                        exercise a rigid monopoly over US imports into the Congo. [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] made it very clear that he wanted
                        US firms to deal directly with <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> or
                        Congolese businessmen and not to be obligated as is presently the case to
                        deal with Belgian intermediaries. In this way, the Belgians make all the
                        profits.</p>
                    <p>D. The next topic taken up was the Societe Generale and [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] devoted nearly ¾ of an hour to
                        this topic but mentioned nothing new ([<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] usually covers this topic with all important
                        visitors and regularly discusses it with [<persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName>] and other [U.S.] officials). [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] insisted that the Union Minière du
                        Haut Katanga (<gloss target="#t_UMHK_1">UMHK</gloss>) had always been a
                        Congolese company, but that the Belgians had changed it into a Belgian one
                        just prior to Congolese Independence. [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] referred to the <gloss target="#t_UMHK_1">UMHK</gloss> being represented by “300 Messieurs” who were highly
                        unscrupulous. [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] reported time
                        and again that [<gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>] could not from a
                        moral, or any other standpoint, support “300 Messieurs” against the <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> and the whole Congolese nation.
                            [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] insisted that Belgian
                        bankers and businessmen, acting on behalf of the Societe Generale, were
                        besmirching the good name and competence of the <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> and the Congolese people in the US, and particularly with
                        the World Bank. In [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s] view,
                        the Belgians are most afraid of economic competition, particularly
                        American.</p>
                    <p>E. Turning his attention to the World Bank, [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] flatly stated that it was to all intents and
                        purposes an American creation and instrument, since the US provided 60% of
                        the capital (erroneous—actually 25%).</p>
                    <pb n="851" facs="0884" xml:id="pg_851"/>
                    <p>F. [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] made it clear that he
                        would continue to do business with the Belgians but that the activities of
                        the Societe Generale would have to be curtailed. He stated that the Societe
                        Generale had confidence in his regime and the future of the Congo, as
                        indicated by its financing the construction of a large commercial business
                        complex in the center of downtown Kinshasa.</p>
                    <p>G. [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] finally turned to [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>]-related matters. He
                        stated that he was extensively involved in expensive political action
                        activities. He clearly intimated that some of these activities also served
                        [U.S.] policy interests. [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>]
                        stated that he has given large sums of money to certain Congo (Brazzaville)
                        leaders (Army and civilians), to <persName corresp="#p_BJB_1">Bokassa</persName> and Tombalbaye to strengthen <gloss target="#t_UEAC_1">UEAC</gloss>, to Zambian President <persName corresp="#p_KKE_1">Kaunda</persName> for forthcoming elections, Burundi
                        for paracommando training of Micombero’s elite batallion and for <gloss target="#t_GDRC_1">GDRC</gloss> propaganda against communist
                        threats.</p>
                    <p>H. [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] bemoaned the fact that
                            [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] in the past had
                        given massive financial assistance to [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            3</persName>] who, without army support, would never become a real
                        leader worthy of the name.</p>
                    <p>I. [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] expressed his
                        appreciation for the current cooperation between [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] and his services and asked [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] that this liaison be continued
                        and enlarged. Specifically [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>]
                        asked [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] to arrange for
                        the early training of [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>]
                        and five others by [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>].
                            [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] interjected that [<hi rend="italic">cryptonym not declassified</hi>] training has already been
                        laid on, but that no commitment had been made about training the other
                        five.</p>
                    <p>J. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] mentioned that he was
                        leaving on 23 November for a visit to the interior of the Congo. [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] replied that [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] should remain on in Kinshasa
                        over the weekend for his regime’s 3rd Anniversary celebrations. [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>] gracefully declined on the
                        grounds that his tight onward schedule regrettably would not permit a
                        stayover.</p>
                    <p>4. The meeting was highly successful and contributed effectively to the
                        continued close rapport between Station and [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>].</p>

                            13, cautioned the Station not to sound out contacts regarding their
                            attitude toward Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName> and to refrain from commenting on any adverse

                                <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName>’s support. The
                            Station should recall the past history of <persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s attempts through his cohorts to denigrate
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName>’s predecessors.
                            (Ibid.)</note></p>
                    <p>1. Station has not and does not plan elicit comments from any Station assets
                        concerning [<persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName>] effectiveness.
                        On contrary, to date, we have refused discuss [<persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName>] other than to make positive statements in his
                        support.</p>
                    <p>2. Wish point out in this connection, however, that [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 1</persName>], [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity 2</persName>] and [<persName corresp="#p_IDE_1">Identity
                            3</persName>] would like [<persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName>], or for that matter any other [Embassy] chief, to
                        exercise a strong advisory influence upon [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>], whom all three claim badly in need good advice.
                            [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] has repeatedly stressed to all
                        three that [<persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName>] most
                        influential Mission Chief on [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>] anyway. Possibly these three misinterpret [<persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">McBride</persName>’s] shyness. No doubt these three
                        would like [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] to play the role of
                        [former <gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] with [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>]. [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] has made it clear repeatedly that times and circumstances
                        have changed radically since [former <gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>]
                        days and that therefore [<gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>] cannot and
                        will not play such a role.</p>
                    <p>3. In sum do not believe this matter constitutes any real problem. It is a
                        fact, nonetheless, that the members of the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                            line not declassified</hi>] and others are genuinely worried about
                            [<persName corresp="#p_MJD_1">Mobutu</persName>’s] present increasing
                        isolation and what should be done about it.</p>
                    <p>4. <gloss target="#t_HQS_1">HQS</gloss> can rest completely assured that no
                        Station member will ever be indiscreet or disloyal in any way regarding
