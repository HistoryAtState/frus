                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The Historian
                    of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the
                    preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of
                    the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, under the direction of
                    the General Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series,
                    plans, researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. Secretary of
                    State Frank B. Kellogg first promulgated official regulations codifying specific
                    standards for the selection and editing of documents for the series on March 26,
                    1925. These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through
                    1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, which was signed by
                    President <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">George H.W. Bush</persName> on October
                    28, 1991, established a new statutory charter for the preparation of the series.
                    Section 198 of P.L. 102–138 added a new Title IV to the Department of State’s
                    Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 <gloss target="#t_USC_1">U.S.C.</gloss> 4351,
                    et seq.).</p>
                <p>This statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government.
                    The statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary
                    Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the
                    principles of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered
                    or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has
                    been made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the
                    purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than
                    30 years after the events recorded. The editors are convinced that this volume
                    meets all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly standards of selection and
                    editing.</p>

                <p>This volume documents the multilateral arms control policies of the <persName

                    nuclear safeguards, sales of nuclear equipment, environmental modification, and
                    ratification of the 1925 Geneva Protocol outlawing chemical and biological
                    weapons. Most of these negotiations took place in international arenas such as
                    the Conference of the Committee of Disarmament (<gloss target="#t_CCD_1"

                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time.
                    Memoranda of conversations are placed according to the date and time of the
                    conversation, rather than the date a memorandum was drafted. Documents chosen
                    for printing are authoritative or signed copies, unless otherwise noted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the Chief of the Declassification and
                    Publishing Division. The documents are reproduced as exactly as possible,
                    including marginalia or other notations, which are described in the footnotes.
                    Texts are transcribed and printed according to accepted conventions for the
                    publication of historical documents within the limitations of modern typography.
                    A heading has been supplied by the editors for each document included in the
                    volume. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation are retained as found in the
                    original text, except that obvious typographical errors are silently corrected.
                    Other mistakes and omissions in the documents are corrected by bracketed
                    insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an addition in roman type. Words
                    or phrases underlined in the source text are printed in italics. Abbreviations
                    and contractions are preserved as found in the original text, and a list of
                    abbreviations is included in the front matter of each volume.</p>
                <pb n="V" facs="0006" xml:id="pg_V"/>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount and, where possible, the
                    nature of the material not declassified has been noted by indicating the number
                    of lines or pages of text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for
                    declassification purposes have been accounted for and are listed with headings,
                    source notes, and number of pages not declassified in their chronological place.
                    All brackets that appear in the original text are so identified in footnotes.
                    All ellipses are in the original documents.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document’s source, original
                    classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also provides
                    the background of important documents and policies and indicates whether the
                    President or his major policy advisers read the document.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used where appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic
                    Documentation</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute, reviews records, advises,
                    and makes recommendations concerning the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series. The Advisory Committee monitors the overall
                    compilation and editorial process of the series and advises on all aspects of
                    the preparation and declassification of the series. The Advisory Committee does
                    not necessarily review the contents of individual volumes in the series, but it
                    makes recommendations on issues that come to its attention and reviews volumes,
                    as it deems necessary to fulfill its advisory and statutory obligations.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    conducted the declassification review for the Department of State of the
                    documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with
                    the standards set forth in Executive Order 13526, as amended, on Classified
                    National Security Information and other applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security, as <pb n="VI"
                        facs="0007" xml:id="pg_VI"/>embodied in law and regulation. Declassification
                    decisions entailed concurrence of the appropriate geographic and functional
                    bureaus in the Department of State, other concerned agencies of the <gloss
                        target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments. The
                    declassification review of this volume, which began in 2008 and was completed in
                    2014, resulted in the decision to withold 0 documents in full, excise a
                    paragraph or more in 5 documents, and make minor excisions of less than a
                    paragraph in 10 documents.</p>
                <p>The Office of the Historian is confident, on the basis of the research conducted
                    in preparing this volume and as a result of the declassification review process
                    described above, that the record presented here provides an accurate and
                    comprehensive account of arms control and nonproliferation policies during the
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> and <persName
                        corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> administrations.</p>

                    Historian by providing full and complete access to records pertinent to foreign
                    policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected records.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the
                    central files of the Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”)
                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department’s Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and the Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the files
                    of overseas diplomatic posts. All the Department’s indexed central files through
                    July 1973 have been permanently transferred to the National Archives and Records
                    Administration at College Park, Maryland (Archives II). Many of the Department’s
                    decentralized office files covering the 1969–1976 period that the National
                    Archives deems worthy of permanent retention have been transferred or are in the
                    process of being transferred from the Department’s custody to Archives II.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series also have full

                    foreign policy records. Presidential papers maintained and preserved at the
                    Presidential libraries include some of the most significant foreign
                    affairs-related documentation from the Department of State and other Federal
                    agencies, including the National Security Council, the Central Intelligence
                    Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In addition,

                    <p>The momentum for adherence to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty has
                        slowed. We believe it is important that the United States reaffirm the high
                        priority it attaches to the Treaty. While Australia is expected to become a
                        party to the Treaty on January 23, the non-nuclear members of the European
                        communities are proceeding slowly toward adherence. At the same time, a
                        number of key countries have shown no recent visible progress in this
                        direction. The list includes: Japan, India, Israel, Brazil, Argentina,
                        Spain, and South Africa. Despite repeated references by United States
                        officials to our full support for broad adherence to the Treaty, Japanese
                        officials continue to indicate <pb n="2" facs="0036" xml:id="pg_2"/>that
                        they are not convinced of this because of the lack of a high-level <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> statement on the subject.</p>
                    <p>In our judgment a reaffirmation of our interest in widespread adherence to

                    <p>In response to the request for a review of the verification aspects of the
                            <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 157 study and an analysis of any
                        further verification measures deemed appropriate, it was the consensus of
                        the Working Group that there have been no new developments which would
                        affect the general consideration stated in the <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1"
                            >NSSM</gloss> 157 study that there is no dependable way to verify
                        compliance with most prohibitions or limitations on chemical weapons.
                        However, in view of Soviet elaborations on the idea of national committees,
                        it was determined that a more detailed examination than that provided in the
                            <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 157 study was warranted. This
                        report contains a description of possible activities for national
                        committees, advantages and disadvantages of the arrangement, background
                        material on the national committee idea, and a description of possible
                        organizational structures for a national committee.</p>
                    <p>The Working Group believes that the national committee arrangement should be
                        considered in conjunction with verification Option 1 as a possible procedure
                        to reinforce compliance features of that option, perhaps thereby resulting
                        in enhanced overall political constraints.</p>
                    <p>Option 1 involves international procedures providing for a Consultative
                        Committee of <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> experts, exchanges of
                        relevant data, peri<pb n="4" facs="0038" xml:id="pg_4"/>odic declarations of
                        compliance, and the handling of complaints of possible violations through
                        consultations.</p>
                    <p>As an adjunct to Option 1, this report discusses adding the requirement that
                        National Supervisory Committees be established to monitor and document
                        compliance procedures within their own countries and to provide other States
                        Parties with reports on their work through the International Consultative
                        Commission.</p>

                        Committees</p>
                    <p>The Committees’ activities within their own countries might include
                        requirements for (1) visits to facilities falling within the scope of the
                        treaty, and (2) submission of reports on compliance and data on production
                        and consumption of specific chemical substances. Internationally, the
                        Committees would provide an International Consultative Commission with
                        reports on their activities and confer with other Committees periodically at
                        meetings of the Commission. Countries lacking a chemical industry need not
                        be required to establish a national committee. In this case, the
                        Consultative Commission could set up procedures to assist such countries
                        regarding the observance of the treaty.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Advantages</p>
                    <p>—These national/international procedures could enhance overall political
                        constraints of the treaty by expanding and elaborating requirements for
                        Soviet participation in institutionalized compliance machinery.</p>
                    <p>—The procedures could add to our knowledge of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss>’s chemical capabilities through the Soviet National
                        Committee’s reports to the Consultative Commission on visits to facilities
                        and other matters, and by providing opportunities to discuss <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> treaty questions with experts of the Soviet
                        National Committee at periodic meetings of the Consultative Commission.</p>
                    <p>—Since the Soviets proposed a national committee arrangement, and several
                        other <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> members have supported the idea,
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> could obtain negotiating advantages
                        by including the idea in any proposal it makes.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Disadvantages</p>
                    <p>—The national committee arrangement could not be relied upon to provide
                        assurance of compliance since it would be subject to strict political
                        control in the Soviet Union, and perhaps elsewhere, and thus would be
                        essentially self-inspection.</p>
                    <p>—There would be a need to persuade the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        chemical industry to cooperate with the arrangement (legislation may be
                        required) in return for only a marginal increase in political
                        constraints.</p>
                    <pb n="5" facs="0039" xml:id="pg_5"/>
                    <p>—The political and technical problems in negotiating these arrangements and
                        then implementing them might outweigh potential gains, as illustrated by the
                        following examples: (a) the weakness of self-inspection by national
                        committees could be the object of particular criticism by any domestic
                        opponents of the treaty; (b) the national committees could be misused in an
                        attempt to “whitewash” a possible violation; (c) selection of the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Committee could involve some delicate
                        public relations problems in view of the potential adversary role of the
                        committee in relation to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>

                    <p>Subsequent to the informal meeting in July of the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1"
                            >CCD</gloss> chemical experts, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RAA_2"
                            >Roshchin</persName> outlined to the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1"
                            >CCD</gloss> the official Soviet position on such arrangements, noting
                        that national organizations—under a special program agreed upon by
                        international experts—would exercise general control over treaty compliance,
                        and that they may have reasonably wide access to industrial plants and
                        verify the implementation of the agreement <hi rend="italic">in situ</hi>
                        and might periodically inform other parties to the agreement of their
                        work.</p>
                    <p>N.N. Melnikov, the Soviet expert who participated in the July <gloss
                            target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> meeting, recently expanded on his remarks
                        to the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> in a draft paper for a <gloss
                            target="#t_SIPRI_1">SIPRI</gloss>-sponsored working group on <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> verification. In this paper, Melnikov
                        described far-reaching and highly specific functions for national committees
                        which would exchange information at annual conferences of experts.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets have discussed the national committee arrangement only within the
                        context of a comprehensive ban on chemical weapons. The Soviets might not,
                        however, accept it in the context of a partial prohibition.</p>
                    <p>Some <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> members have urged strict
                        international verification, but this has been largely in the context of
                        comprehensive prohibitions involving the elimination of stockpiles. Several
                            <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> members have supported the idea of
                        national committees in some form and it is expected that the idea would
                        receive considerable support in the context of partial measures.</p>
                    <p>For the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, there are uncertainties
                        regarding the Soviet position on the functions of the national committees
                        and their relationship to an international forum. Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_RAA_2">Roshchin</persName> has described only a few general
                        functions for such committees while remaining silent on any related
                        international machinery. If reporting requirements resulted in any
                        information concerning the location of and production data for Soviet plants
                        producing chemicals with carbon-phosphorous bonds as well as production data
                        for Soviet plants producing certain chemicals of the dual-purpose or
                        precursor variety, this could add to our knowl<pb n="6" facs="0040"
                            xml:id="pg_6"/>edge of Soviet activities in the chemical field. The
                        publication of such information, however, would be subject to strict
                        political controls in the Soviet Union, and we do not know whether the
                        Soviets would provide data on individual plants. (We are not certain to what
                        extent the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> chemical industry would wish
                        to provide such data to the rest of the world.)</p>

                        Supervisory Committee</p>
                    <p>The Parties might be divided into two groups according to the state of
                        development of their chemical industries:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>1. States which possess plants capable of manufacturing single-purpose
                            chemicals and/or plants actually manufacturing specified dual-purpose
                            chemicals (the “haves”);</p>
                        <p>2. States which do not possess such plants (the “have-nots”).</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>There is no need for the “have-nots” to establish elaborate supervisory
                        arrangements. It would probably be sufficient for the head of government to
                        designate a single individual to be responsible for preparing the required
                        reports and declarations. The “haves” would be required to set up national
                        supervisory committees (<gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>). However, the
                        “haves” will differ greatly among themselves as to levels of development of
                        their chemical industries and types of administrative systems.</p>
                    <p>The general functions of an <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> might be
                        specified in the treaty. In addition, the International Consultative
                        Commission might make recommendations concerning committee activities.
                        However, each State Party could remain free, within the context of treaty
                        provisions, to determine the size and complexity of the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> necessary in its own particular situation
                        to fulfill its treaty obligations.</p>
                    <p>The possibilities for an <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> range across a
                        broad spectrum of complexity. Two examples are discussed below. It should be
                        understood that these are presented only for purposes of illustration.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. National Supervisory Committee plus a very small
                        staff</p>
                    <p>The Committee would be an independent body, responsible directly to the
                        President. Representatives from the government, from the scientific
                        community, and from the general public would be appointed to the committee
                        by the President. The day-to-day work of the committee would be conducted by
                        a staff of about five people. The committee itself would meet one or two
                        times a year to review <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> implementation
                        of the Convention and to certify reports and declarations prepared by the
                        staff for transmission to other States Parties and to the <gloss
                            target="#t_ICC_1">ICC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. A National Supervisory Committee plus a
                        medium-sized staff</p>
                    <p>This example differs from the first one in that a larger staff is provided,
                        allowing more extensive supervisory activity. A national <pb n="7"
                            facs="0041" xml:id="pg_7"/>supervisory committee would be established in
                        the same manner as discussed under 1.</p>
                    <p>The staff might: issue regulations to govern reporting and inspection
                        activities; monitor production and use of chemicals under control; develop
                        technical procedures for inspections; monitor scientific and technological
                        developments related to the subject matter of the treaty; and maintain
                        liaison with other national committees and with the <gloss target="#t_ICC_1"
                            >ICC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Under the first example, about five additional personnel would be hired. The
                        annual cost to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government would be
                        about $250,000. In the second example, 20–25 people would be needed. Some
                        experts might be made available by appropriate government agencies. Annual
                        costs for the second model would be roughly $1–1.5 million.</p>

                    <p>As you requested, attached is a proposal on chemical weapons as a possible

                            >Brezhnev</persName> during the latter’s visit. It builds on the 1972
                        Moscow Joint Communiqué which indicates the <gloss target="#t_USA_1"
                            >USA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> would “continue

                    <pb n="8" facs="0042" xml:id="pg_8"/>
                    <p>The Senior Review Group just considered the <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1"
                            >NSSM</gloss> 157 study, <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> position
                        on chemical weapons prohibitions, and I understand that a draft memorandum
                        for the President will be forwarded to you shortly on this matter. If the
                        President decides to ban at least <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> agent
                        production (State’s and Defense’s choice), this would provide the
                        opportunity for proposing a relatively short moratorium on the production of
                        such agents as an impetus to negotiations at the Geneva Conference of the
                        Committee on Disarmament (<gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss>). (Including
                        open-air testing of lethal agents themselves in the moratorium might be
                        considered, but this would probably involve a bureaucratic struggle.)</p>
                    <p>If a decision is reached soon on <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 157,
                        we would probably be in a position to table a draft treaty in Geneva at the
                            <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> either in late April or early May
                        after our consultations with <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Allies
                        and Japan. Thus, an agreement with <persName corresp="#p_BL_1"
                            >Brezhnev</persName> would follow soon thereafter and would be related
                        to the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> negotiations.</p>
                    <p>You should be aware that it is quite well known that we have produced no
                        stocks since the mid-1960s and plan no production for stockpiling purposes
                        at least for the next two years (but, subject to congressional approval,
                        production of binary artillery shells could probably begin in 1975).
                        Therefore, a moratorium of about 2–3 years would not require a significant
                        change on our part. Of course it cannot be verified, and this might raise
                        congressional problems.</p>
                    <p>You should also be aware that although the Soviets have asked us for
                        counterproposals at the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> and suggested
                        they are open to limited treaty proposals, they have to date supported the
                        comprehensive approach to prohibit the development, production, and
                        stockpiling of <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> agents and munitions.
                        Thus, a ban on production may not satisfy the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>Attached (Tab A) is a paper you could give to <persName corresp="#p_DA_1"
                            >Dobrynin</persName>. It suggests two points: a moratorium and a
                        commitment to achieving more permanent international agreement. The language
                        is somewhat technical but this must be carefully drawn in view of the
                        widespread production of chemicals for peaceful use.</p>

                        progress towards <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>. In event Soviets try
                        at next <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> to blame lack of <gloss
                            target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> progress on Chinese, as <gloss
                            target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_Del_1">Del</gloss> has speculated (Geneva 919), it will be
                        important that neither Soviets nor anyone else be able to say that <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> encouraged, aided, or even acquiesced in
                        such Soviet maneuver.</p>
                    <p>B. It is important that our response to Soviets not be portrayable as
                        “plotting or conspiring” with Soviets about Chinese disarmament policies or
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>C. If we failed to respond to Soviet request for conversations this would
                        provide grounds for Soviets, as well as possibly others, to say either or
                        both of following: first, <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> was not
                        sufficiently interested in achievement of <gloss target="#t_CTB_1"
                            >CTB</gloss> to respond to request for conversations on an important
                            <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> issue; second, <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> can be presumed to be satisfied with most
                        recent Soviet public statement on participation of nuclear powers in <gloss
                            target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> (which could be interpreted as tending to
                        put blame for no progress on <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>) since
                        otherwise <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would have taken up with
                        Soviet <gloss target="#t_Del_1">Del</gloss> its suggestion for further talks
                        on matter.</p>
                    <p>D. We wish to avoid giving others, and especially our allies, any grounds for
                        believing that special bilateral talks between <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> are starting in
                        order to resolve key test ban issues.</p>
                    <p>E. We wish to avoid taking any positions in conversations with Soviets which
                        would foreclose policy options available to <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                            >USG</gloss> in connection with overall <gloss target="#t_CTB_1"
                            >CTB</gloss> issue.</p>

                    <p>2. <gloss target="#t_USDel_1">U.S. Del</gloss> is instructed to make
                        following points in response to Soviet <gloss target="#t_Del_1"
                        >Del</gloss>:</p>
                    <p>A. <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Delegation is prepared to respond to
                        Soviet Delegation’s request for further discussions on point raised by
                        Soviet Delegation, namely, what should be position with respect to mandatory
                        parties for a <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>; however, <gloss
                            target="#t_USDel_1">U.S. Del</gloss> believes that there is no need for
                        special, separate talks on this question and that further conversations can
                        and should take place in course of normal exchanges at regular co-chairmen
                        meetings.</p>
                    <p>B. <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> position on question of mandatory
                        parties for a <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> remains, as <gloss
                            target="#t_USDel_1">U.S. Del</gloss> has already informed Sov <gloss
                            target="#t_Del_1">Del</gloss>, that “participation of all nuclear powers
                        in an agreement has not been determined by the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> to be a prerequisite to a <gloss target="#t_CTB_1"
                            >CTB</gloss>.” We believe that it would not be appropriate or desirable
                        to adopt any more detailed or far-reaching position at this time.</p>
                    <p>C. This position permits serious work to continue on other important issues
                        relating to test ban. Progress will, in fact, have to be made on them before
                        a <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> can be realized. We have pointed out
                        that verification question, on which <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> continue to have basic
                        differences, clearly warrants further work and have, ourselves, contributed
                        important material in form of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> working
                        paper of last August on seismic verification.</p>
                    <p>D. We have noted that Soviet <gloss target="#t_Del_1">Del</gloss> has
                        informed <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> that Soviet Government has
                        made no determination that participation of all nuclear powers is
                        precondition for <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> (Geneva 798 and 854).
                        For reason stated above, we believe this is appropriate position given
                        current status of <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> deliberations and,
                        therefore, we would hope that <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> would
                        continue in this position. Soviet plenary statement of February 20, however,
                        has created some question among many <gloss target="#t_Del_1">Dels</gloss>
                        whether, in fact, this is Soviet position. We would hope that Soviet <gloss
                            target="#t_Del_1">Del</gloss> could clarify in response to interest of
                        Japanese, Netherlands and others that position it stated to <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> at February 19 co-chairman meeting
                        (similar to that in sub para B above) does remain Soviet position.</p>
                    <p>E. If Soviet <gloss target="#t_Del_1">Del</gloss> has further comments to
                        make pertaining to remarks of Soviet co-chairman about relationship of
                        question of mandatory parties to question of scope (partial or complete) of
                        an underground test ban, we will be interested in receiving these and will
                        consider whether we have any questions or comments to make about these
                        further clarifications.</p>
                    <p>F. Sov <gloss target="#t_Del_1">Del</gloss> should know that <gloss
                            target="#t_USDel_1">U.S. Del</gloss> has, pursuant to customary
                        practice, discussed with its allies the above points and will, as is normal,
                        continue to consult with its allies about <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss>-Soviet exchanges on this matter. We, of course, assume
                        that Soviets will consult their allies in normal fashion.</p>
                    <pb n="11" facs="0045" xml:id="pg_11"/>
                    <p>3. Before conveying response to Soviets, <gloss target="#t_USDel_1">U.S.
                            Del</gloss> should inform dels of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                        allies and Japan at Western group meeting of response we plan to make. We
                        appreciate great interest our allies have in this matter and, therefore,
                        should discussion with allies reveal, in <gloss target="#t_USDel_1">U.S.
                            Del</gloss>’s judgment, any elements which should be modified or added
                        in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> response to Soviets, it should
                        report those promptly for our consideration prior to meeting with Soviets.
                            <gloss target="#t_USDel_1">U.S. Del</gloss> should not, however, give
                        allies impression that <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is soliciting
                        suggestions from allies for modifications in its planned response to

                            >UK</gloss> officials were thinking that next step should be exploration
                        at <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> of comprehensive <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> treaty with full-scale verification
                        including on-site inspections. <persName corresp="#p_RCM_1">Rose</persName>
                        expressed opinion that we were all committed to comprehensive treaty, and,
                        therefore, should at least make initial effort in this direction. <persName
                            corresp="#p_LJF_1">Leonard</persName> acknowledged that we were
                        committed to objective of ultimately achieving comprehensive prohibitions;
                        however, we were not repeat not committed to doing this through approach of
                        a single comprehensive treaty. Article IX of Biological Weapons Treaty spoke
                        of objective of effective prohibition <pb n="12" facs="0046" xml:id="pg_12"
                        />(including destruction) of chemical weapons through “effective
                            measures”—<persName corresp="#p_LJF_1">Leonard</persName> stressed that
                        the reference was to measures in the plural. A commitment to work in good
                        faith toward this objective, through “measures,” was very different from a
                        commitment to a single comprehensive treaty, which we did not have.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_RCM_1">Rose</persName> also suggested that
                        possibility of comprehensive treaty prohibitions had not yet really been
                        explored at Geneva and we could put onus on Soviets for failure to achieve
                        this, before considering partial measures. <persName corresp="#p_LJF_1"
                            >Leonard</persName> noted that, on the contrary, in the last several
                        years, there had been extensive work in Geneva on various problems and
                        questions involved in comprehensive <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>
                        prohibitions. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> had submitted many
                        relevant working papers, e.g., on extent to which it would be possible to
                        distinguish between stockpiles of chemical munitions and stockpiles of
                        conventional weapons, and on the problems involved in destruction of
                        chemical weapons; a number of delegations had submitted papers outlining
                        verification schemes that they thought might be used in connection with
                        comprehensive approach.</p>
                    <p>4. In course of discussion, <persName corresp="#p_LJF_1">Leonard</persName>
                        pointed out that there might be some undesirable operational consequences
                        from tactical standpoint if <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> or West were
                        to table proposals for a comprehensive treaty. It could not be safely
                        assumed that one could easily or automatically shift from a comprehensive
                        proposal to a partial proposal once Soviets or others had rejected the
                        Western proposals for verification. Other governments, including some of our
                        allies, might take position that scope of treaty, i.e., comprehensiveness,
                        was fully agreed, and all that was left was to reach “compromise” on
                        verification. It would be open to various delegations to argue that
                        verification, even with on-sites, could not provide 100 per cent
                        reassurance. For example, in verifying whether Soviets had destroyed all
                        their stocks, we might not know where to seek on-sites in order to be sure
                        no stocks were remaining anywhere in the Soviet Union. These governments
                        would then argue that it was only a question of degree as to how good
                        verification needed to be (with or without on-sites), and we ought to
                        cooperate with <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> members, like the
                        Yugoslavs and the Swedes, in seeking “compromise” in which some acceptable
                        amount of reassurance was found without on-sites. Thus we could find
                        ourselves on the classical “slippery slope” towards a comprehensive treaty
                        when we might not think one was practical or sound. (<persName
                            corresp="#p_LJF_1">Leonard</persName> noted that it was not clear that
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would be willing to join in a
                            <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> proposal which implied that
                        comprehensive prohibitions, involving complete elimination of our chemical
                        weapons, could be adequately verified by virtue of inclusion of provisions
                        for some on-sites.)</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_LJF_1">Leonard</persName> also pointed out that even
                        if, speaking hypothetically, a Western proposal for a comprehensive treaty
                        with extensive verifica<pb n="13" facs="0047" xml:id="pg_13"/>tion,
                        including on-sites, were put forth, it was quite uncertain that the Soviets
                        would be generally blamed thereafter for lack of progress. Although the
                        Soviets would, of course, resist on-site inspections for political reasons,
                        they would certainly argue that on-site inspections are not a genuinely
                        practical method of verification in the case of <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss> controls. The Soviets and their allies had already argued in
                        Geneva that, given the vastness of chemical industries in large and
                        developed countries, on-site inspections would not be workable in providing
                        significant reassurance regarding possible proscribed activities. As
                            <persName corresp="#p_LJF_1">Leonard</persName> had already pointed out,
                        it was hard to see how on-site inspections could give you any real grip on
                        the problem of the location or size of <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>
                        agent or munition stockpiles in the Soviet Union. The Soviets could then be
                        expected to charge that since on-sites were clearly not a practical
                        solution, the West obviously had the political purpose of frustrating
                        agreement by making a demand which it knew was neither acceptable nor
                        effective. It was questionable in such a situation whether we would really
                        be placing the onus for lack of progress on the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>6. After lengthy discussion of above considerations, <persName
                            corresp="#p_RCM_1">Rose</persName> appeared to accept that there might
                        be serious tactical drawbacks to putting forward comprehensive proposal in
                        expectation that this would be way-station to consideration of partial
                        measures.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_RCM_1">Rose</persName> raised question of possible
                        partial measures and specifically possible ban on production of <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> agents. <persName corresp="#p_LJF_1"
                            >Leonard</persName> assured <persName corresp="#p_RCM_1">Rose</persName>
                        that if <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> were to decide to put this
                        approach before its allies, it would do so only in belief that security
                        interests of the Alliance would be served. <persName corresp="#p_RCM_1"
                            >Rose</persName> expressed opinion that most substantial consideration
                        in favor of conceivable production ban was that West, and <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> in particular, had very little expectation
                        of substantially increasing its chemical warfare arsenal under present and
                        foreseeable circumstances. Nonetheless, British were still likely to have
                        problems with this approach, in part because they were uncertain as to
                        extent of threat from Soviets on <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RCM_1">Rose</persName> stated that he planned to
                        look in more detail at intelligence picture when he returned to London.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RCM_1">Rose</persName> concluded that no decision
                        had been taken in London against any partial approach and noted it would
                        take time for British to study matter fully.</p>

                    <p>On April 9, 1973, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Richard M.
                            Nixon</persName> transmitted to Congress a copy of the 1972 annual
                        report of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency entitled “Arms Control
                        Report: 12th Annual Report to Congress, <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, January 1–December 31, 1972.” In a
                        White House press release issued on April 9, the President noted the
                        agency’s accomplishments during the previous year:</p>
                    <p>“The year covered by this report has been the most rewarding in the
                        twelve-year history of the agency. Agreements reached with the Soviet Union
                        in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks testify to the determination of this
                        Administration to move away from the dangers and burdens of unrestrained
                        arms competition and toward a stable and constructive international
                        relationship.</p>
                    <p>“The negotiations have resulted not in concessions by two parties, one to the
                        other, but in mutual arrangements to insure mutual security. For the first
                        time, the United States and the Soviet Union have taken substantial steps in
                        concert to reduce the threat of nuclear war. The current round of <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> negotiations will concentrate on
                        achieving a definitive treaty on the limitation of offensive weapons
                        systems.</p>
                    <p>“The past year has also seen continued progress in other areas of arms
                        control.</p>
                    <p>“Four years after the initial <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                        proposal, positive planning has begun for a conference on Mutual and
                        Balanced Force Reductions in Central Europe. The Convention banning
                        biological weapons and calling for the destruction of existing stockpiles
                        was opened for signature on April 10, 1972. At the Conference on the
                        Committee on Disarmament in Geneva, the problems associated with the control
                        of chemical warfare through international law were subjected to patient and
                        careful examination. The number of nations adhering to the Nonproliferation
                        Treaty has now reached 76 and successful negotiations on safeguard
                        arrangements have paved the way for ratification by key European
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>“Much has been accomplished, but much remains to be done. With the beginning
                        of my second term in office, I rededicate my Administration to the goal of
                        bringing the instruments of warfare under effective and verifiable control.”

                                the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs <persName corresp="#p_NC_1"
                                    >Nomura</persName> indicated that the Japanese Government had

                                Assembly session and at the recent Conference of the Committee of
                                Disarmament meeting the possibility of a “partial approach” to the
                                control of chemical weapons but that the government had received few
                                reactions to this effort. <persName corresp="#p_NC_1"
                                    >Nomura</persName> also indicated that the partial

                                chemical weapons—appeared “feasible” due to Soviet reluctance to
                                permit on-site inspections.</p>

                        control of chemical weapons both at the last <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                            >UN</gloss> General Assembly session and at the Spring <gloss
                            target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> session. At this time, he continued, a
                        partial approach prohibiting the production and development of super-toxic
                        agents, seemed to be the only feasible one because of the reluctance of the
                        Soviet Union to agree to the on-site inspections which the Japanese believed
                        necessary for adequate verification of a comprehensive <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> ban. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NC_1"
                            >Nomura</persName> added <pb n="16" facs="0050" xml:id="pg_16"/>that
                        thus far there had been very little reaction from other countries to the
                        Japanese statements and asked our view of their initiative.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NAF_1">Neidle</persName> answered that over the
                        past year the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> had intensively reviewed
                        all the possible approaches to controls on chemical weapons. We had as yet
                        taken no decisions on the basis of this review. However, our review
                        indicated that complete elimination of chemical weapons presented many
                        difficult problems. The destruction of <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>
                        would be a long and difficult process; more importantly, it would be
                        virtually impossible to verify destruction of all stockpiles. For these
                        reasons we regarded it as a useful contribution to the discussion of <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> for the Japanese to have suggested the
                        possibility of a partial <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> treaty.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NC_1">Nomura</persName> asked whether, if we
                        decided to make a proposal on <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>, it would
                        be in the form of a draft treaty and if so, when such a proposal could be
                        expected. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NAF_1">Neidle</persName> responded that
                        while it was not decided whether we would have a specific <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> proposal, we hoped for a decision on <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> in the relatively near future. If we decided
                        to take an initiative it might well be in the form of a draft treaty. We
                        would want to consult in detail with the Japanese when our decision on
                            <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> had been made.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NC_1">Nomura</persName> then asked our opinion of
                        the Brazilian <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> proposal for a partial
                            <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> treaty beginning with a prohibition
                        on stockpiles. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NAF_1">Neidle</persName> answered
                        that we had considered the Brazilian idea, but regarded it as very
                        impractical to attempt the elimination of stockpiles when they could be
                        easily replenished if there were no production ban. If a production ban were
                        combined with a stockpile proposal, a possibility the British had raised
                        last summer, we then would have a comprehensive ban with all the attendant
                        problems. Moreover, the Brazilian proposal did not solve the difficulty of
                        verifying destruction of all stockpiles. The Japanese proposal would not
                        involve the problem of verification to the same extent, since if <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> stocks (i.e. the existing deterrent) were
                        retained, verification might not be as critical an element of an agreement.
                        Brazil, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NAF_1">Neidle</persName> continued, had
                        advanced its proposal with the explanation that it did not want to “disarm
                        the disarmed”, i.e., that it did not wish merely to prohibit acquisition of
                        chemical weapons by those countries that did not now possess them; rather
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss> who have stocks should carry out the first “disarming” and
                        destroy their stockpiles. The problem with this, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_NAF_1">Neidle</persName> said, was that we have a great deal
                        to give up in so limiting ourselves; to do so without adequate verification
                        would be quite unbalanced and could be a serious risk to security. Speaking
                        in the abstract, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NAF_1">Neidle</persName> went on,
                        a good argument might be advanced, as the Japanese have done, that a
                        production ban might be a good way to start on the control of <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>. It would halt production by countries now
                            <pb n="17" facs="0051" xml:id="pg_17"/>able to manufacture <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>, prevent production by others, and could
                        thus be viewed as a measure based on the status quo, preventing any new
                        competition or build-up in <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NC_1">Nomura</persName> then asked if we thought
                        the Soviets could accept a partial measure such as the Japanese had
                        suggested. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NAF_1">Neidle</persName> said it was
                        difficult to speculate, but the Soviets had shown themselves very flexible
                        at Geneva and anxious to consider even partial <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss> measures. The Japanese proposal was a stop-where-we-are
                        proposition; it might not be inherently difficult for the Soviets to go
                        along with it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NC_1">Nomura</persName> commented that “everyone”
                        at Geneva was waiting for a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> proposal; it was time for the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to put forward its approach to <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NAF_1"
                            >Neidle</persName> said we appreciated this desire and pointed out that
                        the Secretary of State had said at the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1"
                            >UNGA</gloss> that we would present our views at an early date. We have
                        taken time to respond, he continued, because any <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss> measure would touch on our security, and could affect
                        on-going programs. Therefore, while we are naturally interested in the views
                        of those non-aligned who are pressing for sweeping action on <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>, these views cannot be central to our
                        consideration of the issue. We were pleased that the Japanese have taken a
                        much more reasonable, practical approach and hoped they would not be
                        discouraged by adverse non-aligned comments. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NC_1"
                            >Nomura</persName> replied that he shared our concerns on security and
                        felt that the Japanese would not be affected by non-aligned criticism of the
                        partial proposal.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Yushita commented that if the Soviets had sufficient chemical weapons
                        they might be willing to consider a production ban. What quantities did we
                        think they had? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NAF_1">Neidle</persName> said that
                        although it was difficult to estimate, we assumed they possessed the amount
                        of <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> they believed militarily necessary. It
                        was conceivable the Soviets might therefore see some advantage in freezing
                        the present situation through an agreed halt in production.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NC_1">Nomura</persName> asked for our assessment of
                        the Japanese proposal for an informal meeting on a <gloss target="#t_CTB_1"
                            >CTB</gloss> in the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> summer session,
                        saying he had the impression the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> had
                        not been enthusiastic about the proposal. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NAF_1"
                            >Neidle</persName>, noting that he welcomed the chance to comment, said
                        that in fact we fully supported some aspects of the Japanese proposal but
                        were quite unenthusiastic on others. We supported the basic idea of an
                        informal experts meeting on the <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>, and
                        intended to contribute to the discussion on seismic means of verification,
                        bringing up to date and providing more detail on the subjects in our 1972
                        seismic verification working paper. We were not enthusiastic, however, about
                        the idea of discussion at the informal meeting on Peaceful Nuclear
                        Explosions (<gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>). This was a partly
                        technical, partly highly <pb n="18" facs="0052" xml:id="pg_18"/>political
                        question and could become a starting point for attacks on the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>. Brazil and India were likely to state
                        their belief that any country has the right to make its own peaceful
                        explosive devices, contrary to the basic rationale of the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>. We hoped Japanese representatives at the
                            <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> would try to head off such
                        discussion as nothing can be gained from the Pakistan-India argument likely
                        to ensue if India expresses its view of the right to build explosive
                        devices. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NC_1">Nomura</persName> accepted the
                        point adding, however, that Pakistan, India and Brazil were not likely to
                        ratify the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> whether or not <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> were discussed at the <gloss
                            target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NAF_1"
                            >Neidle</persName> replied that there was also a question of whether
                        discussion of the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> issue was useful with
                        respect to a <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>. We believed the problem
                        on <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> in relation to the <gloss
                            target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> was not ready for solution. Moreover,
                        there was an indirect effect on the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> as
                        such discussion did not improve the climate for the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                            >NPT</gloss>. We hoped <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> would not
                        be discussed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NC_1">Nomura</persName> responded
                        that the Japanese experts who would attend the meeting were seismologists
                        not competent to discuss <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>; it was even
                        possible that the subject would not come up in the informal meeting.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NC_1">Nomura</persName> then asked why we were
                        reluctant to discuss non-seismic means of verification, specifically
                        reconnaissance satellites. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NAF_1"
                            >Neidle</persName>, drawing Japanese attention to his terminology, said
                        that “national means of verification, other than seismic” touched on a very
                        sensitive security area. If we discussed these means, to whatever extent
                        they bore on test ban questions, it could reveal information about national
                        means more generally. He assured the Japanese that we have not discussed
                        these means in relation to a possible test ban, not because we did not wish
                        to advance work on a test ban but because we are flatly unable to do so on
                        security grounds. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NC_1">Nomura</persName>
                        mentioned satellites in the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> context
                        and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NAF_1">Neidle</persName> pointed out that the
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreements referred only to
                        national means of verification. We did not discuss these means with the
                        Soviets; we merely agreed that neither side would attempt to interfere with
                        the other’s national means. This was quite different from the full report on
                        the possibilities of national means for test ban verification that the
                        Japanese had requested when proposing the informal meeting. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_NAF_1">Neidle</persName> expressed the hope that the
                        Japanese would not press the exploration of “national means other than
                        seismic.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NC_1">Nomura</persName> said he
                        understood and he believed that the Japanese would not do so.</p>
                    <p>Changing the subject, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NC_1">Nomura</persName>
                        commented that perhaps for the time being we regarded nuclear tests as
                        necessary for weapons development. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NAF_1"
                            >Neidle</persName> noted that we had been asked by Sweden last year
                        whether this was the case and whether this led us not to want a <gloss
                            target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>. Our response was that, while there were
                        advantages to testing, we were willing to forego these advantages if we are
                        sure other parties are doing the same; a test ban must therefore be
                        adequately verified.</p>
                    <pb n="19" facs="0053" xml:id="pg_19"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NAF_1">Neidle</persName> then mentioned that the
                        Japanese had discussed two possible forms of attendance at the informal
                        meeting: experts together with political officers; and experts meeting
                        alone. He noted that the Japanese delegation had apparently urged that both
                        types of meetings be held. We were strongly against a meeting of the second
                        type since this could result in an effort to come to conclusions with the
                        purpose of embarrassing some participating governments. We had had one very
                        bad experience with a test ban experts meeting (without participation of
                        political officers) some 15 years ago and we could not contemplate such
                        meetings now. He added that, on the other hand, meetings of the sort we had
                        held in recent years, i.e., experts participating with heads of delegations,
                        had proved genuinely valuable. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NC_1"
                            >Nomura</persName> said he understood Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NAF_1"
                            >Neidle</persName>’s point, and the Japanese would not urge a meeting of
                        experts alone.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. <gloss target="#t_WDC_1">WDC</gloss>
                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NC_1">Nomura</persName> then turned to the <gloss
                            target="#t_WDC_1">WDC</gloss>, saying that he understood those countries
                        which did not believe the <gloss target="#t_WDC_1">WDC</gloss> Special
                        Committee should meet were discussing two possible approaches: immediate
                        adjournment; and transforming the meeting into informal consultations. He
                        asked for our latest information. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NAF_1"
                            >Neidle</persName> said that it appeared that these two alternatives had
                        now, in effect, been merged and he summarized for the Japanese a <gloss
                            target="#t_USUN_1">USUN</gloss> cable on the tactical situation. He
                        noted that while we were not a direct participant in the <gloss
                            target="#t_WDC_1">WDC</gloss> Special Committee, we believed that there
                        was no utility to the Committee. Given the absence of most of the nuclear
                        powers, the circumstances surrounding the formation of the composition of
                        the Committee, and the fact that the meeting was designed by the Soviets to
                        embarrass the Chinese, the Special Committee could not help the cause of
                        serious arms control. We therefore had been encouraging those who asked our
                        views to attempt to avoid a meeting or, if a meeting were convened, to try
                        to take no decisions. At this stage, however, an informal meeting for
                        consultations was probably unavoidable; we believed the result of the
                        consultations should be a decision that no formal meeting should take place.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NAF_1">Neidle</persName> expressed the hope that
                        the Japanese would support whatever move developed either to prevent a
                        formal meeting or to see that it took no decisions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NC_1">Nomura</persName> said that it was likely the
                        Japanese <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> delegation would that evening
                        answer the Secretary General’s letter by naming a representative to the
                        meeting. He added that he would cable Tokyo recommending that his government
                        support tactical moves of the sort described above.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Chinese Participation in Disarmament</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NC_1">Nomura</persName> stated that it was very
                        desirable to have Chinese participation in disarmament discussions and asked
                        what ideas we <pb n="20" facs="0054" xml:id="pg_20"/>had on inducing their
                        participation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NAF_1">Neidle</persName> said that
                        many countries had made it clear to the Chinese, in a variety of ways, that
                        they would be welcome at the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss>. The
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> had made a public statement to that
                        effect at the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> in June, 1971. These
                        overtures have not elicited a positive Chinese response; however, the
                        Chinese have indicated in conversations with others that they have not taken
                        any final decision on the question of possible participation in the <gloss
                            target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> at some future time. They have also asked
                        that they not be pressed on this issue. We do not ourselves see any tactics
                        which could force a favorable Chinese decision in the near future. Others,
                        like the Japanese, may naturally wish to continue to express publicly the
                        desirability of <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> participation in
                        disarmament efforts. However, we should be careful to avoid any actions that
                        might push the Chinese to the extent that they felt compelled to respond
                        more negatively about arms control negotiations than they otherwise might
                        have.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NC_1">Nomura</persName> said that he basically
                        agreed, and noted that “quiet diplomacy” rather than public pressures seemed
                        to be the best approach.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">5. French Nuclear Testing</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NC_1">Nomura</persName> raised the possibility of
                        some joint Australia-New Zealand action on French nuclear testing and asked
                        if we had any comments. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NAF_1">Neidle</persName>
                        said that we would naturally like all countries to adhere to the Limited
                        Test Ban Treaty, but we did not think we should try to force it on anyone.
                        The question of possible <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss>–<gloss
                            target="#t_GNZ_1">GNZ</gloss> action was one in which we would not wish
                        to involve ourselves. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NC_1">Nomura</persName> said
                        his government was sympathetic to an Australian suggestion of a protest
                        conference. He added that the Japanese had suggested to the Australians that
                        if a protest conference was held when France tested, one should also be held
                        when China tested. The Australian reaction to that had been
                        “sympathetic.”</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NAF_1">Neidle</persName> raised the
                        Non-Proliferation Treaty, saying that we had on the whole been encouraged by
                        the generally positive nature of the Japanese Foreign Minister’s recent
                        statement in the Diet on the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>. However,
                        we had thought there was some suggestion of uncertainty over the question of
                        security as it related to ratification of the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                            >NPT</gloss>. Indeed, there had been some reference to the fact that the
                        security part of the situation was “unsatisfactory.” Was there concern in
                        the Japanese government that the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> had
                        not subscribed to the 1968 <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Security
                        Council assurances for non-nuclear countries? Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_NC_1">Nomura</persName> said he didn’t believe his
                        government was now concerned about security in relation to ratification. It
                        was primarily concerned with implications for the peaceful uses of nuclear
                        energy, particularly in securing the <pb n="21" facs="0055" xml:id="pg_21"
                        />same safeguards treatment as that negotiated by <gloss
                            target="#t_EURATOM_1">EURATOM</gloss> with the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1"
                            >IAEA</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NAF_1">Neidle</persName> said
                        he would like to comment further on the security aspect, which he believed
                        should not be a problem. The 1968 Security Council resolution had expressed
                        the political reality that assurances were desirable to support the
                        non-proliferation regime. However, the fact that the <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> had not subscribed to that resolution is
                        not significant since, for Japan’s security, the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss>-Japan treaty relationship and our deterrent nuclear forces
                        are the relevant factors. Moreover, real circumstances could not be
                        envisioned in which Chinese non-adherence to the resolution would have any
                        practical impact. For example, would the Chinese behave any differently in
                        the <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> in the case of a Soviet nuclear
                        threat against Japan whether or not they had been present and had voted for

                            >Neidle</persName> concluded by expressing the hope that realistic
                        analysis would be the key factor in viewing the security question and the

                        further steps have been taken to develop policy on this matter.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_PCDB_1">Pell</persName> intends to hold
                        hearings soon on his resolution banning hostile uses of weather modification
                        and other types of geophysical warfare. At similar hearings last year, we
                        could say only that the resolution was “premature.”</p>
                    <p>It was widely assumed last year that our real objection to the resolution was
                        that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> was engaging in the military
                        use of weather modification in Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>When the Under Secretaries Committee considered weather modification over a
                        year ago, no information on weapons uses was made available by the
                        Department of Defense or the Joint Chiefs of Staff. With the termination of
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> involvement in hostilities in
                        Indochina, I presume that the need for secrecy on weather modification is
                        lessened and data can now be made available to the Under Secretaries
                        Committee for review. If need be, participation can be strictly limited and
                        controlled.</p>
                    <p>I recommend that you direct the Under Secretaries Committee to review the
                        utility of weather modification as a military weapon, or its use in
                        conjunction with military activities, and that you further direct <pb n="23"

                    <p>On July 31, 1973, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Richard M.
                            Nixon</persName> and his Assistant for National Security Affairs
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry Kissinger</persName> met with
                        Japanese Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KT_1">Kakuei Tanaka</persName>
                        and Japanese Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TY_1">Takeshi
                            Yasukawa</persName> at 11 a.m. in the White House. <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KT_1"
                            >Tanaka</persName> first discussed an exchange of visits and several
                        trade issues before turning to the issue of nuclear capabilities:</p>
                    <p>“The President asked the Prime Minister for his evaluation of the
                        international situation, which is more important. In past meetings he said
                        that he has only discussed <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Japan
                        bilateral relations, and perhaps Korea, except for certain confidential
                        matters. Today, he noted that Japan lacks a nuclear capability, as we know,
                        which it could have except for reasons for which we are fully aware. He said
                        that Japan is a major world power because of its enormous economic
                        productivity, which would inevitably force on it certain choices. He
                        confided that in the awareness of many other national leaders, Japan is in
                        fact considered to be a nuclear power. In his talks with them, he said that
                        leaders in the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>, <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the European nations express great
                        respect for Japan, not just because it is a great economic power, but
                        because they all realize that Japan is destined to become the second most
                        powerful nation in the world. Citing Herman Kahn’s thesis that Japan might
                        emerge as the leading nation in the world by the end of the twentieth
                        century, he said that he believes that Japan would play a great role in the
                        world. It was for this reason, he explained, that he spoke as he did above.
                        He also inquired whether the Prime Minister wished to discuss, in
                        confidence, the future of Southeast Asia, <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss>-Japan relations and our relations with Europe, Russia, and
                        China.</p>
                    <p>“Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KT_1">Tanaka</persName> said that he
                        wished to do so.</p>
                    <p>“The President cautioned that he would tread on sensitive political ground.
                        He observed that a number of nations throughout the world are jealous of
                        Japan, both for the past and the present role it plays in the world. In the
                        United States there are a number of isolationists who <pb n="24" facs="0058"
                            xml:id="pg_24"/>do not wish to see Japan play any role, but would rather
                        see it live unto itself. However, he said that his own fundamental view is
                        that an economic giant cannot remain a political pygmy, which is contrary to
                        the laws of nature. An economic giant, he stressed, could never remain a
                        political pygmy. The time for decision is now, but not in the form of a
                        treaty or policy decisions about security forces. He said that we need to
                        know, as a friend, what a forward-looking leader like the Prime Minister
                        sees as the role Japan will play in the world.</p>
                    <p>“Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KT_1">Tanaka</persName>, by way of
                        preface, said that the entire Japanese people appreciate the aid and
                        assistance given by the United States over the past quarter-century, which
                        has enabled Japan to make a rare achievement in recovering from total
                        defeat. The basic wish of the Japanese people is to take their place forever
                        alongside the free nations, cooperating closely and in full consultation
                        with the United States.</p>
                    <p>“Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KT_1">Tanaka</persName> stated that
                        Japan would not possess nuclear weapons because of constitutional
                        restrictions. However, as a member of the international community Japan
                        would make whatever positive contribution it could to promote world peace in
                        the technological, economic and other areas. Japan would also play a
                        positive, constructive role in support of international agencies, to resolve
                        such issues as the monetary problem, international liquidity, the new round
                        of trade negotiations and economic assistance to the <gloss

                    <p>“With respect to the newly emerging problem of energy, including petroleum,
                        enrichment of uranium, and particularly the search for new energy resources,
                        Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KT_1">Tanaka</persName> said that Japan
                        would positively support international cooperation, centered on the United
                        States. However, he reiterated, Japan would not possess nuclear or military
                        power because of its constitutional restrictions.” (Memorandum of

                            target="#t_PNW_1">PNW</gloss> initiatives might provoke. The Soviets
                        have approached the British and might be planning démarches to other
                        governments to accede to the agreement. In addition, they might intend to
                        float a resolution at the next <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> General
                        Assembly endorsing the agreement. Both types of initiatives could be
                        designed to isolate Peking.</p>

                        Agreement</p>
                    <p>We do not expect that the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> will respond
                        positively to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> suggestion that
                        they “accede” to the agreement. (The State Department is preparing a

                            target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> reaction.) However, a round of such Soviet
                        démarches to other friends of ours could elicit a variety of responses hard
                        to control for us and result in a certain amount of mischief.</p>

                    <p>The Soviets have urged us to join them in tabling the <gloss

                            >CCD</gloss> in Geneva. This could be preparatory to tabling a
                        resolution in New York giving general praise to the agreement and urging all
                        states (or perhaps all nuclear powers) to accede to it, or support it, or
                        negotiate similar agreements. Such a move would be a natural sequel to (and
                        transformation of) their major agenda item last year on the Non-Use of
                        Force, on which we abstained.</p>

                    <p>In order to head off further Soviet approaches to third parties and the
                        raising of the agreement in the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> in a
                        manner embarrassing to us, we recommend that a firm approach be made to the
                        Soviet Union as soon as possible. This could include the following
                        elements:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>a. We stand by the agreement and will naturally be more than willing to
                            see it given attention at the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> as
                            a valuable and significant achievement.</p>
                        <p>b. However, the agreement is a matter between the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Its
                            internal wording, referring to the Moscow “Basic Principles” of May 29,
                            1972, and the circumstances of its conclusion emphasize the uniquely
                            bilateral nature of the agreement.</p>
                        <p>c. The agreement is not a treaty or other international document which
                            might be considered open to accession by other parties. There is no
                            provision in the agreement for accession.</p>

                                >USSR</gloss> on matters of grave importance to the two countries.
                            It is the view of the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> that neither
                            party to the agreement should attempt to establish a relationship
                            between the agreement and any third party or solicit the endorsement of
                            others for it in a <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> context. The
                            bilateral character of the agreement and of the ongoing dialogue of
                            which it is a part indicate that nothing should be done by either party
                            in this regard without the full agreement of the other party.</p>
                        <p>e. The <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would greatly regret it if
                            any unilateral actions by the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                            concerning the agreement were to complicate further discussions between
                            our governments on these important matters or lead to differences
                            regarding the meaning and purpose of this agreement.</p>

                        <p>1. How many countries are getting highly enriched uranium?</p>
                        <p>2. What if a country simply abrogates the agreement and keeps the
                            uranium?</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Supply Abroad.</hi> We presently have only one contract to
                        supply large quantities of highly enriched uranium abroad (in Germany).
                        Supply began in May 1972 and is being spread out over a couple of years.</p>
                    <p>Other countries which are most likely to be interested in acquiring reactors
                        fueled by highly enriched uranium include Japan, Brazil, India, France,
                        Spain and perhaps the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>. No request for
                        supply is now at issue, but there could well be some problems if <gloss
                            target="#t_HTGR_1">HTGR</gloss>s prove competitive and are promoted
                        widely. (The relatively small and insignificant quantities of highly
                        enriched uranium sent abroad for research purposes are not at issue.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Abrogation of an Agreement.</hi> A country could of course
                        abrogate an agreement and seize the highly enriched uranium. The safeguards
                        against such action rely mainly on supplying only those countries in which
                        we have confidence. To determine this, each request would be <pb n="28"
                            facs="0062" xml:id="pg_28"/>reviewed separately and Presidential
                        approval to supply would be required. We will also rely in part on the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_HTGR_1">HTGR</gloss> promoter (Gulf) to show discretion in
                        promoting sales abroad, since Gulf will be advised of our more selective
                        policy process. Of course, we will ultimately be depending upon the good
                        faith of countries which we decide to supply with weapons grade uranium over
                        a period of many (25–30) years.</p>
                    <p>We believe that the policy recommended in the attached memorandum for the
                        President (Tab 1) provides sufficient safeguards in relation to the threat
                        and to the possible alternatives for weapon development by any determined
                        state.</p>
                    <p>An additional policy alternative would be to go one step further and actively
                        discourage sale or development of the reactors abroad. However, the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 150 working group analyzed this question
                        and decided that this could not productively be a general policy guideline
                        since we have an interest in supplying some countries (e.g., West Europeans
                        and Japan). Rather than adopt a broad and discriminatory policy of
                        discouraging any sales to all others, it was concluded that the case-by-case
                        review process provided adequate protection against supplying problem
                        countries.</p>

                        States interests would best be served by the establishment of a total legal
                        prohibition on the stockpiling, as well as the production and transfer, of
                        chemical weapons, regardless of its verifiability.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion</p>
                    <p>The fundamental objective of our <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> policy
                        is, of course, the prevention of the use of chemical weapons against us in
                        any conflict. It is not clear whether an effective deterrent-in-kind against
                            <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> use would add in any significant way
                        to the deterrent already provided by our conventional and nuclear
                        capabilities, on which, according to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                        military doctrine, the Alliance places “principal” reliance for deterrence
                        against <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> attack. What is clear is that
                        present <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> (and <pb n="30" facs="0064"

                        <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>) <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>
                        capabilities, both offensive and passive-defensive, which make possible only
                        token <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> usage in response to attack, can
                        contribute essentially nothing to deterrence against an adversary
                        well-enough equipped to launch a meaningful <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss> attack in the first place. The <gloss target="#t_PM_1"
                            >PM</gloss> memorandum and the <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss>
                        157 study fully describe the practical impossibilities of either making
                        effective deployment and use of our existing stockpiles or developing
                        alternatives which overcome the obstacles to an effective <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> capability.</p>
                    <p>Of course, there already exist significant legal/political barriers against
                        the use of <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>. However, the present legal
                        constraints have some weaknesses which might well destroy their
                        effectiveness in an actual conflict situation. The Geneva Protocol of 1925
                        with its reservations, our unilaterally declared policy, and, perhaps,
                        customary international law prohibit only the <hi rend="italic">first</hi>
                        use of <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>. The priority of use in a confused
                        battlefield situation can be very difficult for third parties, and even for
                        the participants, to ascertain, so long as both parties to the conflict have
                        offensive <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> capabilities. This makes it
                        quite conceivable that <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> use could be
                        initiated on the basis of mistaken field reports of first use by one party,
                        or as a result of unauthorized or inadvertent action by a single unit, or on
                        the simple pretext, unverifiable by a third party, that the other side had
                        initiated use. And once <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> use has been
                        initiated, even at token levels, there are no legal restrictions on the
                        dimensions of use by the other side.</p>
                    <p>The question, then, is whether, at least in the absence of an effective
                        deterrent-in-kind for the foreseeable future, we cannot best achieve our
                        basic objective by strengthening the legal and political “firebreak” against
                            <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> use. A total prohibition on
                        stockpiles would make explicit what is already implicit in the realities of
                        the situation: that we will in fact rely on our other capabilities,
                        including our nuclear capabilities, for deterrence against initiation or
                        continuation of any <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> attack. By denying
                        ourselves any semblance of an offensive <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>
                        capability, and by creating a strong new legal barrier to possession (and
                        thus use) of <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>, we would make more credible
                        the escalatory deterrent on which we would in fact be compelled to rely in
                        any case. Elimination of our stockpiles, of which there could be no question
                        given our open society, would deprive an adversary of any pretext for
                        “retaliatory” use of <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> against us.
                        Concentration of <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> resources on
                        passive-defensive equipment, such as protective clothing and warning
                        devices, in which United States forces are presently sadly deficient, could
                        further reduce any temporary military advantage an adversary might
                        anticipate as a result of <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> use.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusions</p>
                    <p>The conclusions we draw from this analysis are basically as follows:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <pb n="31" facs="0065" xml:id="pg_31"/>
                        <p>First, it is in the interests of the United States to seek the
                            establishment of an internationally agreed legal prohibition on the
                            stockpiling, as well as the production and transfer, of chemical
                            weapons.</p>
                        <p>Second, although we can and should, as suggested by <gloss
                                target="#t_PM_1">PM</gloss>, use our negotiating leverage on this
                            issue to obtain the maximum possible opening-up of Soviet society and to
                            increase the perceived risk to them that a violation would be detected,
                            a total prohibition would be in our interest <hi rend="italic"
                                >regardless</hi> of its degree of verifiability because of the
                            additional inhibitions it would place upon the use of <gloss
                                target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>, to which we will not in any event be in
                            a position effectively to respond in kind.</p>
                        <p>Third, therefore, we should not establish rigid verification requirements
                            as conditions for our willingness to enter into a production and
                            stockpile ban, particularly in light of the general recognition that no
                            verification measures—even on-site inspections—would produce
                            high-confidence verification. Rather, we should adopt a flexible
                            approach which would permit us to negotiate the best possible
                            combination of inspection and other confidence-building measures as part
                            of such an agreement but which would not result in a stalemate over the
                            verification issue.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declarations</p>
                    <p>As we have made clear within the Department and in the interagency working
                        group, we are strongly opposed to the use of bilateral or multilateral
                        “declarations” in place of an agreement. As we understand it, in light of
                        the legal and domestic political problems involved, the Department is not
                        considering recommending either approach. Should either be seriously
                        considered, we would want an opportunity to explain to you our objections to
                        the use of such a procedure.</p>

                            >NSSM</gloss> 157) of alternative approaches to limitations on chemical
                        weapons (<gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>) was recently completed. The
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> has requested agency views on
                        possible <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> limitations, and the memorandum

                        new <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> initiative.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                    <p>We have said that we will not initiate the use of chemical weapons in
                        conflict, and that our <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> stockpiles are for
                        deterrence. We support efforts toward <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>
                        limitations by international treaty, with the proviso that such limitations
                        be effective and be adequately verifiable. (Agencies agree, however, that
                            <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> limitations cannot be fully
                        guaranteed even with on-site inspection.)</p>
                    <p>In July 1972 Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR_1">Laird</persName> wrote
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWD_1">Rogers</persName> endorsing a treaty
                        prohibiting <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> production and transfer.
                            <persName corresp="#p_LMR_1">Laird</persName> noted that such a treaty
                        would not affect <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> capabilities, the
                        expansion of which was unrealistic in present circumstances due to domestic
                        constraints. A treaty also would place constraints on other <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> nations and would inhibit <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> proliferation. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_RWD_1">Rogers</persName> agreed that such a <gloss

                        is 440 tons in the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>, and we understand
                        Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_BW_1">Brandt</persName> would have no
                        objection to total withdrawal. Although this stock could be made to last for
                        5–10 days by reducing usage to token levels, the damage to the enemy would
                        be reduced accordingly and we understand that replenishing it in conflict
                        would tie up a substantial portion of our total airlift, or would require at
                        least a 45 day transit by sea.</p>
                    <p>We also face severe domestic constraints. <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>
                        stockpiles within the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> have generated
                        considerable political opposition. Federal statutes establish extremely
                        restrictive procedures for movement of lethal chemical weapons within the
                        United States which virtually ensure legal and political obstruction of such
                        movements. Moreover, Congress prohibited the use of <gloss target="#t_FY_1"
                            >FY</gloss> 69 or 70 funds for lethal chemical munitions procurement,
                        and the administration has made no such procurement request since. In
                        addition, binary development may well require some open-air testing, which
                        would require Presidential approval and public exposure before the fact.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, there are disadvantages to a <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss> treaty. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not declassified</hi>]
                        Acceptance of a non-verifiable agreement would establish precedents that
                        might work to our disadvantage in <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>,
                            <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss> and future test ban negotiations.
                        We could argue that a <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> ban does not
                        require as rigorous verification as a <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        or <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss> agreement, but this tends to
                        confirm that the <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> deterrent is not of
                        vital importance and could generate further pressures for unilateral
                        reductions. A declaration presents fewer problems of this nature, but would
                        impose fewer restraints on other nations than a treaty. In any event, we
                        believe that verification should be dependent on the strategic utility of
                        the weapons involved and on realistic estimates of the risks of possible
                        violation. As in all arms control agreements, the means of verification
                        should be appropriate to the extent and nature of the controls involved.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A New Initiative</p>
                    <p>On balance, we believe that our <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>
                        “deterrent” is of limited utility, and we have little prospect for improving
                        it. Under these circumstances, a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> initiative would give up very little for
                        gains both at home and abroad. It could give substance to the
                        administration’s pledge <pb n="34" facs="0068" xml:id="pg_34"/>of increased
                        cooperation and reconciliation with the Congress, with particular appeal to
                        the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It would fulfill the two summit
                        communiqués on the subject, while leading to at least some constraints on
                        other countries. Since we are not in a position to make our deployments of
                            <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> more effective at present, it would
                        seem to be in our interest to do what we can to create an effective
                        firebreak against its use by others. We believe an approach can be developed
                        which would orchestrate the best aspects of the various alternatives
                        outlined by the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> studies.</p>
                    <p>If such a course is decided upon, prompt consultations with our <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Allies (particularly the <gloss

                        policy.</p>
                    <p>Our proposed approach is outlined in the attached memorandum to Mr. <persName

                    <p>I agree that there is a high degree of compatibility between <gloss
                            target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss>’s views on <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1"
                            >NSSM</gloss> 157 and the proposed State position which you were kind
                        enough to send us. We will be glad to make this clear to the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> Staff.</p>
                    <p>I would like, however, to comment on one aspect of the proposed State
                        position. The last paragraph of State’s comments is entitled a “willingness
                        to seek a treaty banning stockpiles” and discusses the possibility of
                        seeking “adequate” verification for such a ban. I think that if the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> should adopt the Option II approach, that
                        is, a ban on production, we ought to take the position that a treaty
                        eliminating stockpiles is not realistic or achievable at this time. We would
                        explain that verification to ensure that stockpiles are eliminated and that
                        some stockpiles are not illegally retained is beyond our practical grasp. We
                        would say, however, that the elimination of stockpiles, which is the essence
                        of Option III, remains our long-range objective.</p>
                    <p>If we should come to believe after further study in the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government that C weapons are basically
                        useless as a deterrent, as we came to feel in the case of B weapons, then I
                        believe we might want to proceed with treaty prohibitions which treat C
                        weapons as we did B weapons, that is, eliminates them without additional
                        formal verification requirements, except perhaps observation of destruction.
                        However, until we make a decision of this sort, negotiation of verification
                        procedures to check on retention of illegal stockpiles could be a blind
                        alley unless, of course, we accepted verification that does not tell us
                        whether or not there are illegally retained stockpiles. But this, in my
                        judgment, would be an undesirable precedent as to weapons which are regarded
                        as having military value.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_FonOff_1">FonOff</gloss> disarmament official

                            >Neidle</persName>), Shustov expressed fairly definite views re

                        in a <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>. Shustov said that Soviets
                        believed underground test ban should be accepted by all countries that were
                        testing, including <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> and France. <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_DelOff_1">DelOff</gloss> said he had carefully followed
                        Sov statements on this subject at Geneva. He had received impression that
                        Sovs had stated their desire to end testing by everyone everywhere as a
                        general objective, and Sov <gloss target="#t_DelOff_1">DelOffs</gloss> in
                        Geneva had informed us that Sov Govt had not taken any decision whether in
                        fact <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> and French adherence would be
                        required for underground test ban.</p>
                    <p>2. Shustov replied that it was Sov position that all nuclear powers should
                        adhere to a comprehensive test ban. He commented that some people believed
                        that the “others” (meaning <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> and France)
                        were at quite primitive stage of nuclear development and therefore it should
                        be possible to conclude <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> without them.
                        However, if this were to be done, there would be a “mine” underlying the
                            <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> which might have to go off at some
                        future time, i.e., Soviets might at some uncertain time have to declare that
                        supreme interests were threatened and withdraw. This would not be a good
                        situation. Shustov added that it did not seem right for some nuclear powers
                        to have to stop testing in every environment when some others could test not
                        only in the atmosphere but also underground.</p>

                        supply large quantities of highly enriched uranium to foreign countries for
                        a type of power reactor (High Temperature Gas Reactor or <gloss

                    <p>The export of <hi rend="italic">highly enriched</hi> uranium is at issue
                        because it can be used for weapons and therefore presents more problems of
                        control, and is being addressed now because if <gloss target="#t_HTGR_1"
                            >HTGR</gloss>’s prove competitive, requests for quantities abroad may
                        well rise very significantly. In the future, it would be more difficult and
                        disruptive to alter our supply policy.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Current Policy.</hi> We now consider any requests for
                        large quantities of highly enriched uranium on a case-by-case basis without
                        a presumption that we will supply (although the European Community has been
                        told its requests would receive sympathetic consideration). <hi

                        with restrictions no different than apply to slightly enriched uranium.</p>
                    <p>Highly enriched uranium presents special problems regarding possible seizure
                        by a state or by a terrorist or dissident group because:</p>

                            weapons.</p>
                        <p>—Compared to plutonium, which is more abundant but very toxic and
                            difficult to fabricate, highly enriched uranium would be a much <pb
                                n="38" facs="0072" xml:id="pg_38"/>more desirable material for a
                            weapon made by a dissident or terrorist group.</p>
                        <p>—Physical security measures for nuclear materials are often
                            inadequate.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>Given the above, there are two basic policy questions. <hi rend="italic">1.
                            Should we continue to supply any highly enriched uranium abroad? 2. And,
                            if so, should we adopt some additional constraints regarding supply
                            abroad?</hi>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Continued Supply.</hi> The study considered whether we
                        should stop or severely restrict supply abroad. This could (1) cause some
                        adverse reaction from other countries, including allies, and from Gulf Oil
                        (the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_HTGR_1">HTGR</gloss> reactor developer); and (2) cast
                        doubts on our reliability as a supplier of nuclear fuel services generally.
                        Therefore, <hi rend="italic">all agencies agree</hi> that we should not stop
                        supplying highly enriched uranium <hi rend="italic">but</hi> that we should
                        consider supply requests on a case-by-case basis.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Additional Constraints.</hi> Additional constraints were
                        considered, recognizing that they might produce an attenuated version of the

                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_AEC_1">AEC</gloss> recommends that in deciding on a supply
                        request we should (1) require that a recipient has, in our estimation, an
                        acceptable system of physical security measures to protect against diversion
                        and theft, and (2) consider both a recipient’s position regarding the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> and the location where the fuel would be
                        fabricated and reprocessed, as these are particularly vulnerable segments of
                        the fuel cycle. The views of State, Defense, and <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1"
                            >ACDA</gloss> regarding the extent to which these constraints should be

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">My Views.</hi> Since physical security measures are
                        generally inadequate and since requests for supply may well arise where we
                        do not wish to supply large quantities of weapons grade material because of
                        the concern of diversion by a state or by individuals, <hi rend="italic">I
                            recommend</hi> we establish a policy of a case-by-case review of

                        for some further constraints. Consistent with this recommendation, we should

                    </list>
                    <p>(S) We have reviewed the State initiative on chemical weapons limitations.
                        Our concern is that we not leave ourselves vulnerable to a chemical attack.
                        The Soviets have been modernizing their forces to a degree that their
                        chemical capability exceeds ours both offensively and defensively. Anything
                        we might do to further the gap, such as a declaratory statement or a
                        chemical treaty that would freeze this <pb n="41" facs="0075" xml:id="pg_41"
                        />imbalance—places the United States at a disadvantage. From a military
                        viewpoint, this would be unacceptable.</p>
                    <p>(S) We are particularly concerned if actions that we take reduce or eliminate
                        our capability to retaliate in kind to a chemical attack. Such action would
                        withdraw an important option for the President and could require him to face
                        a choice of using nuclear weapons in response to a chemical attack or not
                        responding.</p>
                    <p>(S) While treaties are desirable, adequate verification provisions must be
                        included to insure we are not placed in an unfavorable position. The
                        verification problems of a chemical weapons treaty have not yet been
                        resolved.</p>
                    <p>(S) For these reasons we would have trouble supporting your initiative
                        particularly when we have an opportunity to make a quantum jump forward in
                        modernizing our chemical weapons with binary munitions. <gloss

                    <p>(C) Obviously we would favor any course of action that would show a
                        willingness to negotiate and we would be willing to work closely with you on
                        future proposals or initiatives in this area.</p>

                    <p>The basic restrictions contained in Title 50 are as follows:</p>

                    </quote>
                    <p>The question whether these prohibitions apply to the binary chemicals and
                        related munitions now under development by the Army depends upon whether, in
                        any form or configuration in which they shall be transported, tested,
                        deployed, stored or disposed of, they would be deemed to constitute “lethal
                        chemical warfare agents” within the <pb n="43" facs="0077" xml:id="pg_43"
                        />meaning of Chapter 32 of Title 50. It should be noted at the outset that,
                        as a matter of textual construction, there are at least two interpretations
                        which might be given to this language. First, it might be read as referring
                        to any agent of lethal chemical warfare. Under this interpretation, any
                        chemical agent which could be used with lethal effect in warfare, whether by
                        itself or in combination with others, would be covered. Second, the phrase
                        might be interpreted as referring to any chemical warfare agent which at the
                        relevant point in time—that is, at the time of transport, storage, etc.—was
                        “lethal”. Under this reading, a non-lethal agent would not be covered even
                        though its intended use was as a precursor to a highly lethal agent, as
                        would be the case in binary weapons. However, a lethal precursor would not
                        be placed outside the scope of this provision by the mere fact that it was
                        many times less lethal than the ultimate agent of which it was the
                        precursor.</p>
                    <p>The legislative history of these provisions does not clearly resolve the
                        textual ambiguities, reflecting, as it does, a relatively simplistic notion
                        of the categories of weapons with which the Congress thought itself to be
                        dealing. The Conference Report on the bill which included the cited
                        statutory sections stated as follows:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>[With an exception not pertinent here], the Conferees agreed to uniform
                            use of the term “any lethal chemical or any biological agent.” While
                            adopting this term, the Conferees wish to make it clear that the
                            restrictions imposed . . . are not intended to apply to the use of
                            chemical or biological materials which are themselves harmless to man .

                    <p>Both passages from the Conference Report suggest that the term “<hi
                            rend="italic">lethal</hi> chemical warfare agent” was intended to
                        exclude incapacitants, riot control agents, and chemical herbicides, but
                        that no finer line was drawn. In particular, the legislative history
                        provides no guidance for the establishment of a toxicity “threshold” below
                        which agents would be considered not to be “lethal”.</p>
                    <p>The history also provides no guidance as to whether the lethality of an agent
                        is to be judged in terms of its end use on the battlefield or of its
                        characteristics at the time of the relevant transport, storage, etc.
                        However, the fact that the statute itself is manifestly designed to ensure
                        protection of the public health and safety in the course of the latter
                        operations would provide a basis for a strong argument that the second
                        interpretation is the correct one.</p>
                    <p>There remains the key question whether the precursors for binary chemical
                        weapons now under development could be said to constitute “chemical warfare
                        agents,” and, if so, whether they would be considered “lethal” within the
                        meaning of Chapter 32 of Title 50. There is a technical distinction to be
                        drawn between “agents” and “precursors”. While this distinction is important
                        for purposes of discussion among specialists, it is very much to be doubted
                        that any court would sustain so technical an interpretation of the statute.
                        Such a distinction would have no significance in terms of the basic policy
                        underlying the statute—that is, the policy of ensuring the health and safety
                        of the civilian population—nor can Congress be thought to have had such a
                        distinction in mind in November of 1969, long before binary weapons were
                        prominent in public thinking on chemical weapons.</p>
                    <p>The more difficult aspect of the question is whether the precursors involved
                        here would be deemed to be “lethal” within the statutory intendment. It is
                        our understanding that one of the two precursors, though many times less
                        toxic than the final agent, nonetheless has a toxicity roughly comparable to
                        that of phosgene. While its primary hazard lies in its caustic
                        characteristics, which pose a direct threat to anything with which it comes
                        in contact, it also can be lethal if inhaled.</p>
                    <p>Under these circumstances, while the situation is not free from doubt, we
                        consider it highly unlikely that a court would find it possible to
                        distinguish between a chemical of this sort and the much more toxic chemical
                        weapons which originally gave rise to the public concern leading to
                        enactment of the statute. The most likely interpretation, in light of the
                        legislative history, would be to the effect that the Congress, in using the
                        word “lethal”, intended to exclude from the coverage of the statute only
                        those agents which are manifestly incapable, under any normal or reasonably
                        foreseeable circumstances, of direct lethal effect. The fact that the
                        chemical involved may be no more hazardous than many industrial chemicals
                        would not exclude it from the coverage <pb n="45" facs="0079" xml:id="pg_45"
                        />of the statute, so long as it could be established that it was both (1) a
                        chemical warfare agent and (2) lethal under the foregoing standard.</p>
                    <p>It should be noted that the law in question here is precisely the sort of
                        statute which can constitute the basis for extensive litigation by a wide
                        variety of private groups. Its interpretation is, therefore, not only a
                        matter of possible dispute with the Congress, but also a question which
                        could readily be brought squarely before the courts. And, like the National
                        Environmental Policy Act of 1969, it does not attempt to establish
                        substantive prohibitions but, rather, merely requires compliance with
                        certain procedures. As experience under the <gloss target="#t_NEPA_1"
                            >NEPA</gloss> has demonstrated, the courts are inclined to interpret
                        such procedural provisions broadly, and the possibilities for legal
                        obstruction on grounds of failure to comply precisely with the procedures
                        are manifold.</p>

                    <p>The Under Secretaries Committee, in response to a request from the President
                        dated March 2, 1971, requested a study of the possible implications of
                        weather modification on our international relations (Tab C). This study,
                        which also examined the military implications of weather modification, was
                        forwarded to the President on February 12, 1972. In early 1972 Senator
                            <persName corresp="#p_PCDB_1">Pell</persName> introduced a resolution
                        similar to the one introduced this year, and I testified on behalf of the
                        Department at hearings conducted on the resolution in July 1972. Senator
                            <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName> on March 21, 1973
                        wrote to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWD_1">Rogers</persName> requesting
                        coordinated Executive Branch comments on the revised resolution (Tab D). Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RKW_1">Rush</persName> wrote to Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_PCDB_1">Pell</persName> on July 30 and August 28 about this
                        matter and discussed it with him at a luncheon on July 19. However, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RKW_1">Rush</persName>’s letter and comments have
                        not gone beyond stating that we have this matter under review. There has
                        been no substantive reply to Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1"
                            >Fulbright</persName>’s letter of March 21, since the Department
                        believes <pb n="47" facs="0081" xml:id="pg_47"/>it cannot be responsive to
                        the letter in the absence of a reexamination of the whole question of
                        military uses of weather modification.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretaries Committee memorandum of February 12, 1972, which
                        forwarded to the President the study mentioned above, said, after noting
                        that it did not have access to all classified information on military
                        applications of weather modification:</p>

                        <p>“As regards our long-term policy, the members of this Committee are
                            agreed that if there is convincing evidence—not available to this
                            Committee—that military use of weather modification against an enemy is
                            essential to our national security, then the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> would necessarily have to hold military options open,

                        <p>However, if no such evidence is brought to bear on this matter or if the

                            members of this Committee would support early consideration of an
                            initiative to propose a ban on hostile uses of weather modification. The

                        <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 165 of May 2, 1972 (Tab E), which was
                        issued in response to the <gloss target="#t_USC_1">USC</gloss> study, said
                        in part, “The President has decided to defer decision on the matter of
                        policy governing military aspects of weather modification.”</p>
                    <p>In July 1972, as the main government witness at the hearings on the earlier
                        version of the resolution, I presented the case against adoption of the
                        resolution at that time on the grounds that there was considerable
                        uncertainty regarding the technical status of weather modification
                        activities. I also cited the uncertainty about verifying compliance with a
                        treaty dealing with the military aspects of environment modification.</p>
                    <p>I doubt, as do Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RKW_1">Rush</persName>, <gloss
                            target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss>, the Department of Commerce, and my
                        colleagues in the Department, whether this position is any longer credible.
                        It is not responsive to the argument made by Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_PCDB_1">Pell</persName> that geophysical warfare should be
                        proscribed before techniques are developed that would lead to further
                        escalation. It is not consistent with our own conclusions that the military
                        value of weather modification tactics is severely limited by fundamental
                        physical constraints. The official position also fails to take adequately
                        into account growing concern about this matter in Congress (Congressmen Gude
                        and Fraser have introduced a resolution in the House similar to Senator
                            <persName corresp="#p_PCDB_1">Pell</persName>’s) and in scientific and
                        academic circles. Considering these factors, Mr. <persName

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                    <p>On September 4, 1973, the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> requested
                        agencies to submit their views regarding <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1"
                            >NSSM</gloss> 157: Review of United States Position on Chemical Weapons
                        Prohibitions. Agencies were to consider two aspects of a possible <gloss

                        (declarations—unilateral or otherwise—contrasted to the treaty form). In an

                        recommended a blended “package” proposal, centered on <gloss

                        ban). Specifically:</p>

                        <p>—a concurrent announcement that the United States intends to seek
                            effective measures to lead to an international agreement prohibiting the
                            production and transfer of such substances;</p>

                            expressions of commitment to more comprehensive measures—a ban on

                        <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss>’s position is highly compatible with
                        the initiative <gloss target="#t_PM_1">PM</gloss> proposed, and Dr. Ikle is

                        1: a treaty reducing stockpiles—but permitting production, including
                        modernization, up to the agreed level. This would permit production for
                        weapons purposes of binary systems (in which two “precursor” agents are
                        combined into a highly toxic agent at time of use). (See Tab B, October 5,

                        me.)</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> rationale, as we understand it,
                        is:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>—The United States should have an adequate deterrent to first use of
                                <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> by an enemy.</p>
                        <p>—A proper deterrent requires significantly greater forward deployment of
                            chemical weapons than we now have.</p>
                        <p>—Owing to extreme Allied sensitivity to the presence of chemical
                            munitions on their soil, <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            forward-deployed stocks have necessarily been limited in that they are
                            sufficient for retaliation only; any use would be severely limited in
                            scale and duration. The problem is compounded by major legal and
                            political constraints on the transportation and storage (in peace-time)
                            of chemical agents and munitions in the United States.</p>
                        <p>—The root cause of these difficulties is civilian fear of the proximity,
                            in transit or in storage, of large quantities of deadly chemical agents
                            in bulk or in munitions. Binary munitions, being no more lethal than
                            some industrial chemicals (until fired), may mitigate this concern.</p>
                        <p>—Transportation of binary chemical munitions would not be constrained by
                            existing <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> law. More importantly
                            their availability would assuage Allied concerns and make possible a
                            very considerable expansion of our forward-deployed stocks.</p>
                        <p>—<gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> option 2 rules out acquisition of
                            binary munitions. <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> option 1 does
                            not. Hence, <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> option 1 is
                            preferable.</p>

                        original position, proposed by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR_1"
                            >Laird</persName> in favor of a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        initiative for a production ban, I have some reason to believe that
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName> has not
                        personally reviewed this position in detail and thus may not be fully
                        committed to it. Obviously, however, it is a matter of consequence that
                            <gloss target="#t_OSD_1">OSD</gloss> is now in line with what had
                        earlier been the <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> dissenting position. I
                        understand that the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> intends, once all
                        agencies have reported their positions, to conduct an analysis of major
                        points of difference which will almost certainly touch on arguments for and
                        against binaries. We will participate in that exercise and are prepared to
                        adjust our views in the light of such new information as may then develop.
                        Meanwhile, before reporting back to you with recommendations for a
                        Department of State position on <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 157,
                        we have looked into the binary question ourselves—taking <gloss
                            target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>’s reasoning, as we understand it, fully
                        into account—and have come to certain conclusions.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Our View</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>’s position regarding <gloss
                            target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 157 rests heavily on the case for
                        binaries, which in turn, depends on two assertions: 1) that binaries will
                        alleviate the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> domestic, political and
                        legal constraints on the transportation and storage of chemical weapons, and
                        2) that binaries will overcome Allied resistance to a substantial increase
                        in forward-deployed stocks of chemical weapons. In our view, these
                        assumptions are very questionable.</p>
                    <p>—Allied resistance to chemical weapons is a product of the aversion of their
                        publics to having any such stocks in their countries, and of a general
                        skepticism as to the military utility of <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                        >CW</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>—Legal advice in the Department of State is of the view that existing
                        legislation in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> does extend to
                        binaries (see Tab C, Memorandum of Law from L). We are aware, of course,
                        that <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> probably has legal counsel to the
                        opposite effect. Our point, however, is that the issue is at the very least
                        in doubt, and will, as L points out, be likely to lead to multiple
                        challenges in the courts, presumably over a protracted period of time.</p>
                    <p>—Finally, my own view would be to oppose a treaty reducing stockpiles since
                        it is probably unverifiable short of intrusive on-site inspections which we
                        could not negotiate.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Proposed State Department Position</p>
                    <p>On balance, it is our conclusion that the analysis and recommendations in our
                        original Action Memorandum are valid (Tab D, September 13, 1973, <gloss
                            target="#t_PM_1">PM</gloss> Action Memorandum, provides detailed
                        rationale). A unilateral declaration in which we undertake not to produce
                        lethal chemical munitions, including binaries, would do us little military
                        harm and some good in terms of our international image. We should, for
                        similar reasons, also indicate our willingness to negotiate a treaty banning
                        production of lethal chemicals providing there were adequate provisions for
                        verification. Congressional response, which probably would be favorable, is
                        also well worth taking into consideration.</p>
                    <p>At this point, therefore, I suggest we stick with our original
                        recommendations (Tab E). Aside from some updating, and minor modifications
                        for greater clarity, we have made only one noteworthy change: the
                        Arab-Israeli war has temporarily created a climate in which a new arms
                        control initiative would not fit very well. Consequently, we no longer
                        recommend that the proposed <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> initiative
                        begin promptly, but rather, at an appropriate time in light of this
                        factor.</p>

                    <p>a. <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> Directive 5210.41, dated 14 August
                        1968, subject: “Security Criteria and Standards for Protecting Nuclear
                        Weapons.”</p>
                    <p>b. <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> Directive 5210.56, dated 6 May 1969,
                        subject: “Use of Force by Personnel Engaged in Law Enforcement and Security
                        Duties.”</p>
                    <p>c. National Security Decision Memorandum 78 (<gloss target="#t_NSDM_1"
                            >NSDM</gloss> 78), dated 11 August 1970, subject: “Authorization for Use
                        of Riot Control Agents and Chemical Herbicides in War (<gloss
                            target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 78) (C).”</p>
                    <p>d. A memorandum by the Secretary of Defense, dated 1 December 1970, subject:
                        “Use of Riot Control Agents in Civil Disturbances (C).”</p>
                    <p>2. (S) Recent planning for the evacuation of noncombatants from a hostile
                        environment and examination of means to increase the security of nuclear
                        weapons from dissident/terrorist activities have highlighted a need for
                        clarification and amplification of national policy concerning the use of
                        riot control agents (<gloss target="#t_RCA_1">RCAs</gloss>) in these
                        areas.</p>
                    <p>3. (S) <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 78 does not address the use of
                            <gloss target="#t_RCA_1">RCAs</gloss> outside of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> bases during peacetime nor the use of <gloss
                            target="#t_RCA_1">RCAs</gloss> in situations short of war in which
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> forces might become involved. The
                        use of <gloss target="#t_RCA_1">RCAs</gloss> by Active military forces is
                        not specifically authorized within the United States or its territories or
                        possessions except during domestic civil disturbance operations (reference
                        1d). Similarly, references 1a and 1b do not clearly authorize the use of
                            <gloss target="#t_RCA_1">RCAs</gloss> as an alternative to lethal
                        force.</p>
                    <p>4. (S) The use of <gloss target="#t_RCA_1">RCAs</gloss> is a highly desirable
                        means to preclude, or at least delay, the use of lethal force in operations,
                        such as emergency evacuation of noncombatants; the active defense of nuclear
                        weapons and their storage sites and recovery operations in which <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> forces are involved; or extraction of
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> personnel abducted or captured by
                        dissidents, terrorists, or riotous mobs. These types of operations could
                        well occur outside of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> bases or posts.
                        For example, some nuclear <pb n="53" facs="0087" xml:id="pg_53"/>weapons
                        which are in the custody of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> personnel
                        are located at storage sites on foreign bases; convoys transporting
                        personnel, equipment, or nuclear weapons regularly operate outside of <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> installations; and temporary encampments
                        frequently are established on foreign soil during tactical exercises and
                        contingency operations.</p>
                    <p>5. (S) The potential advantages to be gained by the use of <gloss
                            target="#t_RCA_1">RCAs</gloss> require their timely employment. Delays
                        inherent in obtaining the necessary authority to employ <gloss
                            target="#t_RCA_1">RCAs</gloss> could negate these potential advantages.
                        It would be highly impractical to prepare a contingency plan for each of the
                        numerous likely situations favoring the use of <gloss target="#t_RCA_1"
                            >RCAs</gloss> in order to obtain prior delegation of authority for their
                        use.</p>
                    <p>6. (S) The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that a memorandum, substantially
                        the same as that contained in Appendix A hereto, be forwarded to the
                        President requesting authority for the use of <gloss target="#t_RCA_1"
                            >RCAs</gloss> by military forces as a means to preclude, or at least
                        delay, use of lethal force in the types of situations and locales cited
                        above when there arise circumstances of a sufficiently serious nature that
                        the use of lethal force is authorized as a last resort. The Joint Chiefs of
                        Staff further recommend that, subsequent to Presidential approval, the
                        referenced <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> directives be modified as
                        indicated in Appendix B hereto.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The Department of State proposes a new initiative on chemical weapons
                        limitations, which combines several aspects of the various options and
                        approaches outlined in the <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 157
                        studies. We support an early unilateral declaration renouncing production of
                            <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> agents, including binary munitions,
                        with a simultaneous statement of intent to seek treaty limitations, with
                        appropriate provisions for verification, banning <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss> production. We should also reaffirm the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> commitment to more comprehensive
                        measures—a ban on stockpiles—when effective measures can be devised.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A Reassessment</p>
                    <p>There are very substantial practical constraints on our <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> program.</p>
                    <p>—As <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 157 points out, we face severe
                        political inhibitions against the movement and even the maintenance of
                            <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> stocks in Europe. Our only overseas
                        deployment (in the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>) would be adequate
                        only for token, usage, and we understand Chancellor <persName
                            corresp="#p_BW_1">Brandt</persName> would have no objection to total
                        withdrawal.</p>
                    <p>—We also face severe domestic constraints: <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>
                        stockpiles within the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> have generated
                        considerable political opposition. Federal statutes establish extremely
                        restrictive procedures for movement of lethal chemical weapons within the
                        United States which virtually ensure legal and political obstruction of such
                        movements.</p>
                    <pb n="55" facs="0089" xml:id="pg_55"/>
                    <p>Binary chemical munitions (in which two chemical precursors combine in flight
                        to produce a nerve agent by time of impact or detonation) are now in a late
                        stage of development in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>. Some
                        maintain that these munitions would make it possible materially to alleviate
                        constraints on present types of chemical agents and ordinance. The
                        Department of State would be pleased to see the rationale for binaries
                        subjected to rigorous scrutiny, and is prepared to adjust its views on the
                        basis of such new information as might then be developed.</p>
                    <p>In arriving at its position on <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 157,
                        however, the Department has already given considerable thought to this
                        matter. We conclude that binary <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> munitions
                        are probably subject to the constraints on transportation and storage
                        imposed by current <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> law, and we have
                        been advised that prolonged litigation on this point is probable, if the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> decides to produce binaries. Binary
                        development may well require open-air testing, which would require
                        Presidential approval and public pre-announcement of the fact. Congressional
                        attitude towards chemical weapons has been clear for some years: Congress
                        prohibited the use of <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 69 or <gloss
                            target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 70 funds for lethal chemical munitions
                        procurement, and the administration has made no such procurement request
                        since.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A New Initiative</p>
                    <p>We believe that our <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> deterrent is of
                        limited utility, and has little prospects for substantial improvement,
                        considering the unlikely combination of prerequisites: a significant change
                        of attitude on the part of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> public,
                        the Congress, and our allies. Since we are not in a position to make more
                        effective deployments of <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>, it would appear
                        to be in our interest to do what we can to create an effective firebreak
                        against uninhibited actions on the part of others.</p>
                    <p>A significant <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> initiative would give up very little for
                        some positive gain both at home and abroad. It could give substance to the
                        administration’s pledge of increased cooperation with the Congress, with
                        particular appeal to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It would
                        fulfill references to <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> limitations in the
                        two summit communiqués, and would lead to some constraints on other
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>There are, of course, disadvantages to a <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>
                        treaty. It would not be possible to verify with confidence compliance with
                        either a production ban or a stockpile limit. Acceptance of a non-verifiable
                        agreement would establish precedents that might work to our disadvantage in
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1"
                            >MBFR</gloss>, and future test ban negotiations. A declaration presents
                        fewer problems of this nature, however, and is therefore a logical first
                        step. As for the precedential aspect, we believe that verification should be
                        dependent on the utility of the weapons involved and on realistic estimates
                        of the risks to our security involved in violation, in relation to the gains
                        we see in a negotiated political constraint. On this basis, <pb n="56"
                            facs="0090" xml:id="pg_56"/>we might express a negotiating position
                        which defines as “adequate” verification measures which are, on the one
                        hand, more specific than those in the Biological Weapons Convention (which
                        are minimal) but, on the other hand, far less specific than anything in
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> or likely to emerge in an <gloss
                            target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss> agreement. Such a posture should enable
                        us to avoid having to seek the unattainable in verification measures—on the
                        grounds that chemical weapons are not of vital importance—but to resist
                        further pressures for unilateral concessions—on the grounds that chemical
                        weapons do have security relevance.</p>
                    <p>We propose, therefore:</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1) A Unilateral Declaration on Production</p>
                    <p>At the earliest appropriate date, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        should declare unilaterally its intention not to produce lethal <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> agents and other highly toxic agents for
                        weapons purposes, and welcome similar restraint by other nations. We
                        strongly favor a unilateral declaration over the bilateral and multilateral
                        approaches, due to the inherent problems in the latter two, such as loss of
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> flexibility, and possible violation
                        of section 33 of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2) Willingness to Seek a Treaty Banning
                        Production</p>
                    <p>We should combine our unilateral declaration with a statement of intent to
                        seek effective measures for incorporating a production ban in treaty form.
                        However, having unilaterally declared a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        production ban, we should retain some flexibility for the present on how we
                        define adequate verification. For example, it would not be desirable to
                        publicly press for “guaranteed verification,” but rather we should espouse
                        such measures as are deemed adequate in proportion to the security
                        considerations involved and which pose sufficient risks to a potential
                        violator to be effective. We have not yet clearly defined what these
                        measures should be for <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> verification.</p>
                    <p>It is generally conceded that complete verification of a <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> production ban cannot be guaranteed, even
                        with on-site inspection. Measures short of “guaranteed” verification can
                        nevertheless increase the political risks to the Soviets of noncompliance.
                        Moreover, it is in our interest to try to open up Soviet practices somewhat,
                        even if verification cannot be fully guaranteed. We should take up the
                        recent Soviet indications at the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> of
                        some flexibility on this issue, regarding “cooperative” verification.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3) Reaffirmation of Interest in a Treaty Banning
                        Stockpiles</p>
                    <p>We should also reaffirm our continued interest in the development of
                        effective treaty measures banning stockpiles, linking this to past
                        expressions on the subject in the two Summit statements, at the <gloss
                            target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss>
                        <pb n="57" facs="0091" xml:id="pg_57"/>and at the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1"
                            >CCD</gloss>. This element of our initiative should be couched in
                        language which clearly conveys the thought that we regard the development of
                        a ban on stockpiles as a longer-range proposition than a ban on
                        production.</p>
                    <p>As noted above, the State position is subject to review should a further
                        study of binary agents develop new information that would warrant it.</p>

                        to procure binary chemical munitions. To be specific, the memo pointed out
                        that we had heard the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> would direct some
                        form of study of the issue (to commence after agencies had reported
                        positions on <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 157, but prior to final
                        consideration of the <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> options by the
                        President) and it pointed out that “We will participate in that exercise and

                    <p>Meanwhile, at <gloss target="#t_PM_1">PM</gloss>’s invitation, Major General
                        Schoning (<gloss target="#t_OASDISA_1">OASD/ISA</gloss>) and some members of
                        his staff visited the Department of State last Wednesday, November 21, to
                        present the military’s case for binary munitions to representatives from
                        Bureaus interested in the outcome of <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss>
                        157. Personally, I found Major General Schoning’s arguments for the binary
                        system cogent enough to strengthen my conviction that, before the President
                        is asked to decide on a negotiating program for <hi rend="italic"
                            >constraining</hi> chemical weapons, issues relating to the <gloss

                        munitions in particular ought to be subject to very close scrutiny.</p>
                    <p>Although I am told that the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> is indeed
                        planning a study of some sort, they reportedly have not yet decided on terms
                        of reference. It could be useful at this point for the Department of State
                        to go on record for a thorough study covering certain key issues.
                        Accordingly, I have attached for consideration a memorandum (at Tab A) to

                    <p>The Department of State position regarding <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1"
                            >NSSM</gloss> 157 (Review of United States Position on Chemical Weapons
                        Prohibitions) was set out in a memo I sent to the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"
                            >NSC</gloss> on November 12, 1973. In that memorandum, we pointed out
                        that the central question dividing agencies is whether or not to maintain an
                        option to procure binary chemical munitions. It was our view that the case
                        for binaries was sufficiently questionable so that, on balance, protecting
                        an option to procure this system ought not to govern the selection of a
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> initiative for developing limited
                        international constraints on chemical weapons. However, we also indicated
                        continued open-mindedness on the binary issue, and we said that “the
                        Department of State would be pleased to see the rationale for binaries
                        subjected to rigorous scrutiny, and is prepared to adjust its views on the
                        basis of such new information as might then be developed.”</p>
                    <p>It seems to me that the President should not have to make a decision as to
                        what means to employ for <hi rend="italic">constraining</hi> chemical
                        weapons until the possible <hi rend="italic">utility</hi> of such weapons to
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has been more thoroughly analysed.
                        I therefore recommend that before <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 157
                        is moved any closer to final decision, the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"
                            >NSC</gloss> should commission an inter-agency review touching on the
                        essential unexplored questions: the rationale for a chemical weapons
                        deterrent; the required delivery systems and stockpiles for a realistic
                            <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> deterrent; the optimum location of
                        stockpiles; the possible role of binary munitions in such stockpiles; a
                        review of legal and political constraints; and the relationship of all these
                        considerations to the arms control alternatives set forth in <gloss

                    <p>However, prior to deciding what, if any, <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>
                        limitations are in the interests of the United States, the President has
                        directed a study of United States deterrent/retaliatory posture options for
                        chemical weapons.</p>
                    <p>Drawing upon past reports as appropriate, including those noted above, this
                        study should comprise (1) an updated summary of the threat and of the
                        rationale for chemical weapons; (2) an updated review of the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and allied chemical warfare capability and
                        programs, and existing and potential constraints on these programs; and (3)
                        full analysis, with advantages and disadvantages, of such <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> posture options as the following:</p>
                    <p>—Improved offensive and defensive <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>
                        capability, with particular emphasis on planned and prospective binary
                        capabilities and forward deployment.</p>
                    <p>—Reliance on the existing <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> capability,
                        including consideration of what actions might be required to avoid
                        significant deterioration of this capability over time.</p>
                    <pb n="62" facs="0096" xml:id="pg_62"/>
                    <p>—Reliance on a more limited <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> retaliatory
                        option with some improved defensive measures.</p>
                    <p>—Reliance on improved defensive measures only (recognizing that this calls
                        into question the retaliatory aspect of the present deterrent/retaliatory
                        policy).</p>
                    <p>The study should also note the relationship of the above considerations and
                        options to the arms control alternatives set forth in the <gloss

                    <p>The President has directed that this study be performed by an <gloss

                    <p>The study should be submitted for consideration of the Senior Review Group by

                    <p>The President has directed a review of United States policy on nuclear
                        testing. The study should take into account recent and prospec<pb n="63"

                        needs, new technology, and political developments.</p>
                    <p>In examining and evaluating the various policy options, the study should both
                        review the current Limited Test Ban and evaluate further possible

                        various yield/magnitude levels, Quota Test Bans, and moratoria. For each of
                        the policy options, the study should at a minimum address the following:</p>
                    <p>—The broad national security impact over time on: (a) the strategic balance,
                        assuming various <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II outcomes; (b)
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and Soviet nuclear weapons
                        laboratories; (c) the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and Soviet lead
                        over the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> in nuclear weaponry; (d)
                        efforts to prevent the further proliferation of nuclear weapons; and (e)
                        employment options in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>-Europe and
                        other theaters in the event of constraints on tactical nuclear weapon
                        modernization.</p>
                    <p>—Possible non-prohibited weapon activities and developments open to the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>—Verification, including developments in seismic and other means of
                        verification, assessment of the value of unmanned seismic observatories and
                        of on-site inspection procedures, and examination of possible means of
                        evasion.</p>
                    <p>—Weapon activities and developments that could occur if the Soviets tested
                        clandestinely in various magnitude/yield ranges where detection may be
                        uncertain or difficult, and the potential impact of such activities and
                        developments on national security.</p>
                    <p>—<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> alternatives for responding to detected
                        or suspected violations by the Soviets or others.</p>
                    <p>—Impact of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and Soviet peaceful nuclear
                        explosion programs, analysis of how any adverse impact might be alleviated,
                        feasibility of using such programs for evasion, and ways of preventing such
                        use.</p>
                    <p>—Considerations of likely negotiability and adherence on the part of key
                        states, including the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>, France, U.K., Israel and India, and
                        implications for <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy.</p>
                    <p>—International political implications.</p>
                    <p>This study is to be conducted by an <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> Ad

                    <p>This Action Program has been prepared by the Under Secretaries Committee in
                        compliance with <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 235 dated October 4,
                            1973.<note n="2" xml:id="d31fn2">See Appendix A. [Footnote is in the

                        <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 235 reported that following his
                        review of <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss>–150 (United States Policy
                        on Transfer of Highly Enriched Uranium for Fueling Power Reactors), the
                        President had directed that an action program (with options and
                        argumentation, as appropriate) should be developed by the Committee. The
                        program was to consider the diplomatic and other steps the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> might consider taking with other nations,
                        and in particular other supplier nations, “with regard to the security,
                        non-proliferation, political and economic aspects associated with the
                        increasing growth and dissemination of nuclear power industries, with
                        particular focus on potential problems associated with highly enriched
                        uranium.”</p>
                    <p>With regard to future exports by the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> of
                        highly enriched uranium, the President also decided that the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> will:</p>
                    <p>—Review any future requests for the supply of large quantities of highly
                        enriched uranium abroad on a case-by-case basis without an <hi rend="italic"
                            >a priori</hi> presumption of supply. (It is recognized, however, that
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has informed the European Community
                        that its requests for supply of highly enriched uranium will receive
                        sympathetic consideration.)</p>
                    <p>—Require that a recipient have acceptable physical security measures in
                        effect.</p>
                    <p>—Weigh the position of the recipient with respect to the Nuclear
                        Non-Proliferation Treaty in reviewing and deciding on requests for
                        supply.</p>
                    <pb n="65" facs="0099" xml:id="pg_65"/>
                    <p>—Not require as an essential precondition of supply that fuel fabrication and
                        reprocessing take place in the United States or in multi-nationally-owned
                        facilities, but will consider this factor in reviewing and deciding on
                        requests for supply.</p>

                        <hi rend="roman">II.</hi> The Key Issues Considered</p>
                    <p>While the specific decision already taken relates to supply of highly
                        enriched uranium,<note n="3" xml:id="d31fn3">Highly enriched uranium, or
                                <gloss target="#t_HEU_1">HEU</gloss> is uranium containing 20% or
                            more of the 235 isotope. [Footnote is in the original.]</note> the
                            <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> makes it clear that the action
                        plan is to take on a broader perspective. Primary among the related factors
                        which should be considered are 1) that plutonium, rather than highly
                        enriched uranium, is the weapon material that will become available in the
                        near term to many nations in sizeable quantities, and 2) that wide
                        distribution of enrichment capability could soon overshadow questions of
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> supply of <gloss target="#t_HEU_1"
                            >HEU</gloss>. Accordingly, in preparing this proposed Action Program,
                        the following four major questions have been considered:</p>
                    <p>1. How should the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> apply the new policy
                        to future transfers of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> highly enriched
                        uranium to other nations?</p>
                    <p>2. What action, if any, should the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> take
                        in informing other existing or potential supplier nations of the more
                        restrictive procedures that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> now
                        proposes to apply in exporting highly enriched uranium? The objective of any
                        such consultations would be to encourage other potential suppliers to adopt
                        policies comparable to our own.</p>
                    <p>3. Are these constraints also applicable in whole or in part to plutonium? If
                        so, what initiatives, if any, should be taken with other countries to assure
                        their adoption?</p>
                    <p>4. What, if anything, can be done to assure adequate physical security for
                        plutonium and <gloss target="#t_HEU_1">HEU</gloss> in foreign custody which
                        is produced indigenously, and hence not subject to supplier constraints?</p>
                    <p>5. Should the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> seek common understandings
                        with other advanced nations—based on the limitations set forth in <gloss
                            target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 235—concerning possible constraints on
                        international transfers of equipment and technology related to plutonium,
                        uranium enrichment and fuel element reprocessing?</p>
                    <p>These last two questions were not addressed in the <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1"
                            >NSSM</gloss> 150 study. However, in the context of potential
                        consultations with other suppliers on the international availability of
                        fissile material, consideration of these questions is highly desirable. This
                        paper and its annexes provide the relevant background in these areas. <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy on export of enrichment technology
                        was exhaustively considered in the studies which led to the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> offer to share gaseous diffusion
                        technology. In <pb n="66" facs="0100" xml:id="pg_66"/>order to focus this
                        study on consultations which could be undertaken in the short term, only
                        consultations based on existing <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy
                        (including the <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 235 decisions) are
                        discussed. This would seem appropriate, since (1) <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> control policy would form an acceptable basis for
                        international control understandings, at least in the short term and (2)
                        questions of the adequacy of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> controls
                        in the longer term, in view of potential technical developments in uranium
                        enrichment methods, are being considered in a separate study.</p>

                        <hi rend="roman">III.</hi> Conclusions and Recommendations</p>
                    <p>Four options for consultations are identified:</p>
                    <p>A. Consult with other suppliers on policy for supply of highly enriched
                        uranium.</p>
                    <p>B. Consult also on supply policy for plutonium.</p>
                    <p>C. Promote the general international application of acceptable physical
                        security on nuclear material.</p>
                    <p>D. Consult on restrictions on export of enrichment and reprocessing equipment
                        and technology.</p>
                    <p>On balance, it is concluded that the options are not mutually exclusive but
                        rather should constitute elements in an overall <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> effort to ensure adequate control of nuclear weapons
                        material. It is recommended that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        undertake a series of coordinated diplomatic initiatives pointed at
                        achieving agreements with other states in the areas covered by all the
                        options.</p>
                    <p>The following are the main observations and objectives which lead to this
                        recommendation:</p>
                    <p>—the need for stimulating adequate physical security constraints throughout
                        the world (and hopefully based on <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> or,
                        as a minimum, <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> standards) is pressing,
                        and should be made equally applicable to plutonium and highly enriched
                        uranium;</p>
                    <p>—generally, whether or not the recipient nation participates in the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> should be a significant factor in
                        Governmental decisions to supply important nuclear assistance, taking into
                        account the actual status of its safeguards negotiations with the <gloss
                            target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>;</p>
                    <p>—where opportunities present themselves efforts to establish multilateral
                        reprocessing and fuel fabrication plants should be encouraged;</p>
                    <p>—special efforts may have to be made to dissuade certain countries (the
                        Republic of China being a good example) from accumulating quantities of
                        plutonium in excess of their immediate needs. In these cases special efforts
                        should be made to encourage the storage of excess plutonium in the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> or in multinational facilities. (In the
                        case of the <gloss target="#t_ROC_1">ROC</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_AEC_1"
                            >AEC</gloss> has agreed to store in the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> the <gloss target="#t_ROC_1">ROC</gloss>-produced
                        plutonium which will be separated in the British Nuclear Fuels Ltd.
                        reprocessing plant in the U.K.)</p>
                    <pb n="67" facs="0101" xml:id="pg_67"/>
                    <p>—it should be recognized that if for any reason we are seriously concerned
                        about the recipient’s continuing willingness and ability to honor
                        agreements, the supply of sensitive material and technology should be
                        avoided.</p>
                    <p>—it is desirable for the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to encourage
                        other suppliers of technology to adopt regulatory constraints similar to its
                        own 10 <gloss target="#t_CFR_1">CFR</gloss> Part 110 (see Appendix E).
                        Moreover, agreement on special constraints in the field of transfers of
                        enrichment technology as outlined in this paper are warranted.</p>
                    <p>The recommended consultations, from a tactical standpoint, would consist of
                        three parallel but not necessarily separate sets of approaches, to be
                        inaugurated over the next several months:</p>
                    <p>1. A series of consultations with other potential international suppliers of
                        enriched uranium or plutonium on constraints governing supply, including
                        desirable physical security measures. In the course of these consultations
                        we would seek to generate a broad recognition of the necessity and
                        importance of adequate physical security measures should override commercial
                        considerations. The recent <gloss target="#t_AEC_1">AEC</gloss> regulations
                        would serve as the guidelines for these discussions, with the understanding
                        that compliance with the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> guidelines
                        on physical security should be the minimum standard.<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d31fn4">The <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> feels that the
                                <gloss target="#t_AEC_1">AEC</gloss> regulations should constitute
                            the minimum acceptable standard. While the other agencies participating
                            in this study agree that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            regulations should serve as the strongly preferred point of departure in
                            consultations, they note that (1) the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1"
                                >IAEA</gloss> standards were formulated by an international working
                            group in which the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> participated,
                            (2) some differences in national practices may be unavoidable, and (3)
                            acceptance of <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> standards as a
                            minimum would be preferable to having no global improvement of physical
                            security measures at all. [Footnote is in the original.]</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>2. Talks with other states likely to possess weapons grade material, and with
                        the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>, on the relative merits of
                        concluding an international convention prescribing basic standards
                        concerning physical protection of nuclear materials and facilities. Again
                        our objective should be to gain acceptance of the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> standards to obtain greater assurance of security.</p>
                    <p>3. Talks with other suppliers of technology and equipment in the reprocessing
                        and enrichment fields on desirable new constraints or guidelines that should
                        be followed in these areas drawing on (a) <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> experience in implementing Part 110 and (b) the specific
                        recommendations appearing on pages 46 to 48 of this paper relating to
                        limitations in the field of enrichment.</p>
                    <p>In general, the international constraints suggested in this study are
                        extensions of existing <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> constraints.
                        Thus adoption of the action plan outlined here should have no major economic
                        penalty for the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, and its success could
                        prevent some potentially substantial losses of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss>
                        <pb n="68" facs="0102" xml:id="pg_68"/>equipment or toll enrichment sales by
                        equalizing terms among suppliers. It must be recognized, however, that in
                        some cases <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> export sales can be lost if
                        consumers consider our terms to be onerous or if failure to meet the
                        criteria disqualifies certain states from receiving our products.</p>
                    <p>The precise timing scenario and content of the foregoing consultations would
                        need to be carefully developed to minimize the possibility of overloading
                        the circuit and producing hostile reactions at the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                            >NPT</gloss> Review Conference to be held in the Spring of 1975.
                        Moreover, the other countries consulted may vary with the subject
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>Periodic reports on the progress of these efforts would be submitted by the
                        Under Secretaries Committee to the President and the principals for their

                        Soviet interest in doing something on the test ban at the Summit (Tab A).
                        This memorandum analyzes the possibilities in this area and recommends a

                    <p>There are four types of agreement which could be reached on testing
                        limitations beyond those in the Limited Test Ban Treaty (<gloss

                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">A Comprehensive Test Ban (<gloss target="#t_CTB_1"
                                >CTB</gloss>)</hi>. We publicly continue to support a <gloss
                            target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> but insist that on-site inspections are
                        required for adequate verification. The Soviets say they are ready to agree
                        to a <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> if verification is limited to
                        national means. They have also said privately that a <gloss
                            target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> would require adherence by all the nuclear
                        powers before entering into force. Political and security concerns vis-à-vis
                        the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> probably play a large role in the
                        real Soviet attitude toward the <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>A major unresolved issue is whether peaceful nuclear explosions (<gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>), which apparently are of great interest
                        to the Soviets, should be banned in a <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>.
                        If they are not banned or appropriately safeguarded—which may not be
                            feasible—<gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> would constitute a
                        gigantic loophole in a <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">A Threshold Test Ban (<gloss target="#t_TTB_1"
                                >TTB</gloss>)</hi>. A <gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss> would ban
                        underground tests above a specified seismic level, which we would attempt to
                        set in accordance with <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> seismic
                        verification capabilities and the level of testing we wished to permit.
                        While we have not opposed a <gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss>, we have
                        pointed out the difficulties in setting the level and verifying compliance
                        with that level (seismic signals are unpredictable and vary with direction),
                        leading to perhaps unintentional violations which could increase
                        international tension. The Soviets have supported a <gloss target="#t_TTB_1"
                            >TTB</gloss> only if it were combined with a moratorium of undefined
                        duration on tests below the threshold, i.e., essentially a <gloss
                            target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> with verification by national means.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">A Quota Test Ban (<gloss target="#t_QTB_1"
                            >QTB</gloss>)</hi>. A <gloss target="#t_QTB_1">QTB</gloss>, such as
                        mentioned to you by <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName>, would
                        limit the annual number of underground tests by each side. In this form it
                        is unverifiable, as it is feasible to carry out a number of tests
                        simultaneously; we have done this a number of times. Accordingly, a <gloss
                            target="#t_QTB_1">QTB</gloss> would likely have to be expressed at least
                        partly in terms of annual cumulative seismic magnitudes, forcing a choice
                        between a few large explosions and a larger number of smaller explosions.
                        This type of cumulative provision would place a premium on measures to
                        reduce the seismic magnitude of tests, such as testing in soft soil or in
                        cavities. This would be difficult to verify precisely. Neither the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> nor the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss> has publicly supported a <gloss target="#t_QTB_1"
                            >QTB</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">A Moratorium</hi>. A moratorium on underground tests
                        could help create a favorable political atmosphere for test ban
                        negotiations, at least between the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. However, unless limited in
                        duration, a moratorium might remove a sense of urgency to negotiate a test
                        ban. As a moratorium would be verified only by national means, it would
                        prejudice the possibility of negotiating additional conditions for verifi<pb
                            n="70" facs="0104" xml:id="pg_70"/>cation. We have opposed pressures for
                        a moratorium, which have arisen in recent years only from the Senate.</p>
                    <p>Given the complexities involved in negotiating verification provisions,
                        threshold levels, and regulation of <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>,
                        any movement at the Summit would probably have to be limited either to a
                        moratorium or to an agreement in principle on negotiation of a <gloss
                            target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss> or
                            <gloss target="#t_QTB_1">QTB</gloss>. To facilitate broad adherence and
                        enhance their value as non-proliferation measures, actual negotiation could
                        take place under the umbrella of the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss>,
                        as was done with the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">The <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> is not as
                            important a measure as it was fifteen years ago. This has decreased the
                            political incentive to pursue it for its presumed political and arms
                            control advantages. Both the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                            process and the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> have preempted many
                            of the positive functions anticipated for the <gloss target="#t_CTB_1"
                                >CTB</gloss>, including the role it could play in improving
                            relations with the Soviets.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>A key political question is the degree of, and motivation for, Soviet
                        interest in further test limitations. The Soviets would value some such
                        limitation as a significant reaffirmation of détente. However, it is
                        probable that they would value such a limitation at least as much for its
                        adverse impact on our relations with the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                            >PRC</gloss>. The Chinese would probably interpret further test
                        limitations as a step to increase pressure on them in an area where it is
                        understood they could not go along in the near term. At the same time, the
                        Soviets would likely want to continue some nuclear testing to avoid any
                        psychological disadvantages vis-à-vis the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                            >PRC</gloss>. This set of motivations would lead them to the posture we
                        have seen: favoring a <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> only on condition
                        of <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> adherence (a point which has been
                        made implicitly in public and explicitly in private by Soviet officials) and
                        favoring some partial limitation on underground testing (such as the <gloss
                            target="#t_QTB_1">QTB</gloss> mentioned to you by <persName
                            corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName>).</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> would probably go along with any
                        further limitation, although full testing of the Super Antelope warhead and
                        re-entry vehicle will require about two more years of testing, if the new
                        government decides to proceed with the scheduled program. The <gloss
                            target="#t_QTB_1">QTB</gloss> idea originated with the previous Labor
                        Government, in 1968. The French would oppose any limitations in the near
                        term.</p>
                    <p>The key near-nuclears who have avoided signing the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                            >NPT</gloss>—Israel and India—would also avoid a <gloss
                            target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>. India, the original champion of the
                            <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>, has prepared the ground by
                        becoming a champion of allowing <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> in any
                            <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>, a loophole which would allow it to
                        maintain and in effect exercise its nuclear option.</p>
                    <p>Domestically, the initial reaction to any further testing limitation would be
                        positive. Whether this persisted and whether the Senate <pb n="71"
                            facs="0105" xml:id="pg_71"/>would give its consent would depend on the

                        Senator <persName corresp="#p_JHM_1">Jackson</persName> would undoubtedly

                            <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>. If the Soviets were anxious to
                        achieve a <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> (there is no sign of this)
                        and were thus willing to concede a provision for on-site inspections, this

                    <p>Major effects of testing limitations on the <gloss target="#t_US_1"

                    <p>—Under a <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>, we would have to forego
                        developing new more efficient warheads for certain specific purposes, such
                        as improved <gloss target="#t_ABM_1">ABMs</gloss> and <gloss

                        unwise, we could choose to deploy untested warheads (as we did during the
                        1958–61 moratorium). The <gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_QTB_1">QTB</gloss> would tend to protect these options.</p>
                    <p>—Under a <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> would not be able to develop small “clean” weapons. This
                        option would be protected under a <gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_QTB_1">QTB</gloss>. Under any type of test ban we
                        would be able to proceed with modernization of our tactical stockpile (which
                        involves the 8 inch and 155 Howitzer) since these weapons are already fully
                        tested.</p>
                    <p>—Under a <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>, our uncertainties would be
                        somewhat higher on the reliability of existing weapons and on hardening
                        non-nuclear weapons system components to nuclear effects (though there are
                        ways to stimulate most such effects). It would be possible to design around
                        potential problem areas, at increased cost. A <gloss target="#t_TTB_1"
                            >TTB</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_QTB_1">QTB</gloss> would tend to avoid
                        these disadvantages.</p>
                    <p>—Adverse impact of further test limitations on our weapons development would
                        be mitigated by the nature of our primary effort in strategic <gloss
                            target="#t_RD_1">R&amp;D</gloss>, which has been in the area of delivery
                        systems as opposed to warhead design. This impact would be further reduced
                        by the greater importance of accuracy over yield in most systems of interest
                        and by the relatively small gains achieved and predicted in yield-to-weight
                        ratios of weapons designs. Although accuracy is affected by <gloss
                            target="#t_RV_1">RV</gloss> shape (which is constrained by warhead
                        size), all our new <gloss target="#t_RV_1">RVs</gloss> have the high beta
                        needed for high accuracy. Further accuracy improvements would be achieved by
                        improvements in missile and <gloss target="#t_RV_1">RV</gloss> guidance.</p>

                        future weapons systems to be designed around existing warheads, but adverse
                        effects are unlikely to be major. Tested weapons are already available for

                    <p>None of these three types of test bans would affect limits on <gloss

                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 128 analysis showed that our
                        strategic retaliatory capability (in terms of Soviet fatalities) is
                        insensitive to a <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> through the 1970s. The
                        analysis also indicated that the Soviet retaliatory capability would not be

                        with the development of relatively small <gloss target="#t_MIRV_1"

                        itself, the Soviets probably have a small enough warhead which, in increased

                        even if not an optimal one.</p>
                    <p>A key problem in analyzing the effect of further test limitations on the
                        Soviets is that, ever since the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Verification</p>
                    <p>A key question regarding the <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> is whether
                        we are prepared to drop our long standing insistence on on-site inspection.
                        Dropping this requirement would undoubtedly be necessary if we were to
                        convince the Soviets to agree to a <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>. On
                        the other hand, if the Soviets were for some reason to press seriously for a
                            <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>, which I don’t foresee, we would
                        get some leverage for seeking their acceptance to on-site inspections.</p>
                    <p>Improvements in seismic techniques and in overhead reconnaissance have
                        greatly increased our verification capabilities since the early <gloss
                            target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> days (1958–63), but they are still not
                        foolproof. Now long-range seismic means can detect and discriminate all but
                        about two percent (about four per year) of those seismic events equivalent
                        in seismic magnitude to a yield of over 5 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>
                        in normal testing modes. In theory, by using special methods to decouple the

                        means increases with yield. Scenarios have been proposed for cheating under
                        a <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> (such as by hiding in an earthquake),
                        but they appear impractical.</p>

                        the tactical warheads and would have little strategic effect.</p>
                    <p>As noted above, a <gloss target="#t_QTB_1">QTB</gloss> would be difficult to

                        nuclear tests. Even further collateral constraints—such as preannouncement
                        and solid information on the nature of the soil in which the test was
                        conducted—would be needed for confident verification. We are unlikely to get
                        such information from the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>Thus:</p>
                    <p>—A <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> cannot be verified with high

                        consequences of successful evasion below this level is not likely to be
                        great. Furthermore, the Soviets could not conduct an extensive series of
                        tests (such as would likely be needed for a significant departure in weapon

                        you probe Soviet interest in a <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>, <gloss
                            target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_QTB_1"
                        >QTB</gloss>—with and without <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> and
                        French participation—and in doing something for us to aid in verification if
                        we were to agree to negotiate a <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>. You
                        should emphasize the difficulty we would have in accepting a <gloss
                            target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> without on-site inspections. If the
                        Soviets appear malleable on on-site inspections, we would have to take the
                        possibility of a <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> much more seriously.
                        You should also probe Soviet willingness to forego <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNEs</gloss>, which would remain as a major obstacle to a <gloss
                            target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_TTB_1"
                        >TTB</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>If for overriding political reasons, you feel it important that the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> take some initiative on this issue, I
                        recommend suggesting a Threshold Test Ban (<gloss target="#t_TTB_1"
                            >TTB</gloss>) to <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>. The
                            <gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss> has less verification problems and
                        less domestic opposition than other alternatives and would cause us less
                        problems internationally. Nonetheless, as I believe the above analysis
                        clearly demonstrates, the <gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss>, like the
                        other alternatives, would be relatively meaningless in its contribution to
                        national security. Nor would it receive significant support from domestic
                        political elements pushing for a <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>. It
                        must be understood for what it is—essentially a cosmetic agreement with
                        little real significance.</p>

                            Ban</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>During your visit to Moscow, the Soviets may raise the question of a
                        comprehensive nuclear test ban (<gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>). If
                        so, I recommend that you raise the closely interrelated issue of Peaceful
                        Nuclear Explosives (<gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>), and propose
                        informal talks to sort out the implications for nuclear proliferation. These
                        informal talks should be on a “private” political level and low key (e.g.,
                        in Washington).</p>
                    <p>A continued <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> program would almost
                        certainly be incompatible with a comprehensive test ban, and perhaps even
                        with a low threshold ban. As you know, the new <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1"
                            >NSSM</gloss> due May 1st will serve to update our position on
                        alternative test bans. This <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> will
                        probably conclude that <hi rend="italic">low</hi> yield tests <hi
                            rend="italic">cannot</hi> be verified and that a high threshold ban
                        which we could verify with national means would have little
                        significance.</p>
                    <p>In 1969, 1970 and 1971, our technical experts held several meetings with
                        Soviet experts on <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>. It is my impression
                        that a technical view prevailed on both sides in these talks, mutually
                        stimulating interest in <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>. Soviet <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> advocates have even been asking us for
                        some time to reinterpret the Limited Test Ban so as to permit nuclear
                        excavation projects that would result in some radioactive venting. An Under
                        Secretaries Committee Study on this subject is underway. We are unlikely to
                        agree to such a reinterpretation.</p>
                    <p>However, we don’t know the importance attached by the Soviet leadership—as
                        distinct from their technical advocates—to their <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> program. Some time ago <persName corresp="#p_VY_1"
                            >Vorontsov</persName> suggested to us we should hold political talks to
                        control the technocratic drives.</p>
                    <p>The time is ripe for us and the Russians to figure out how we might protect
                        our common interest in limiting proliferation from the <pb n="77"
                            facs="0111" xml:id="pg_77"/>possible spread of nuclear explosives under
                        the guise of <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>. Next September an <gloss

                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>. Should the Soviet participants continue
                        to stimulate international interest in <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                        >PNEs</gloss>, many countries will demand technical assistance from the

                        Conference.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets ought to recognize that (1) as long as <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNEs</gloss> are not economically viable, we should not stimulate third
                        country demand for them; but (2) if and when they become viable, we will
                        need strong international institutional arrangements to keep these <hi

                        about a test ban moratorium?</p>
                    <p>Sonnenfeldt: Our first reaction has to be no. We will have real problems with
                        a test ban agreement in any event, both with verification and with peaceful
                        nuclear explosions.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: Everyone has problems with everything I try to do with the
                        Russians. We can’t kick them on every front.</p>
                    <p>Sonnenfeldt: There is a paper on the subject in your folder for this meeting.
                        But in any event, I think we should tell the Russians that a moratorium
                        won’t do and go on to acquaint them with our thinking. We may suggest we
                        could eventually climb toward a threshhold test ban, but in any event, we
                        would have to have bilateral technical talks before we proceed toward any
                        agreement. You could also tell him of our problems within the Washington
                        bureaucracy, especially with <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> on this
                        issue. In other words, we have to be inconclusive.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: Where is the paper? All I see here is 2A, 2B, 2C.</p>
                    <p>Sonnenfeldt: No, you’re looking at <persName corresp="#p_CAD_1"
                            >Denis</persName>’s revised paper on possible bilateral agreements which
                        has separate tabs.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: But where the hell is the test ban paper?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LJM_1">Lodal</persName>: What they are after is really
                        a comprehensive ban for two years and that’s bad.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: Where is <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName>? Not
                        everybody can stay at Zavidovo. We won’t have a goddamned crowd out there.
                        Is someone thinking about who will be out there?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SBA_1">Scowcroft</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: Can I have the children there?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SBA_1">Scowcroft</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: Where is the goddamned paper on the test ban?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SBA_1">Scowcroft</persName>: It’s in your folder.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: Oh, this one. I’ve already read it. It’s good. Now the problem
                        with the quota test ban is that they will run the tests together so we have
                        verification problems and we have difficulties with <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNEs</gloss> in all of these options. Is that right?</p>
                    <p>Sonnenfeldt: That’s right. The only real possibility is the threshold and
                        that is if they include their <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> and keep
                        them below the defined threshold.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: What will the threshold be?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SBA_1">Scowcroft</persName>: We haven’t really looked
                        at that in enough detail.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: Don’t you have any idea?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LJM_1">Lodal</persName>: It would probably be from
                        five to 50 kilotons and be measured seismically.</p>
                    <pb n="79" facs="0113" xml:id="pg_79"/>
                    <p>Secretary: How would it affect our new missiles?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LJM_1">Lodal</persName>: It could very well affect the
                        Trident <gloss target="#t_MIRV_1">MIRVs</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: That is simple. If it affects the Trident <gloss
                            target="#t_MIRV_1">MIRVs</gloss>, we can’t do it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LJM_1">Lodal</persName>: All these options will affect
                        to some extent our missile programs, and that includes a moratorium.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: A moratorium is out of the question. It is obviously a
                        heavy-handed form of Soviet pressure against the Chinese.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: That is what the Russians
                        have in mind.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: How many tests can they run together?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LJM_1">Lodal</persName>: From five to ten.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: All together?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LJM_1">Lodal</persName>: It’s easy to do. We have done
                        it ourselves. You could ignore the limit of the number of tests and rely on
                        seismic indicators, but they too are difficult to verify.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SBA_1">Scowcroft</persName>: What we are talking about
                        wouldn’t constrain either side.</p>
                    <p>[Secretary:] So what is the problem?</p>
                    <p>Sonnenfeldt: Cheating. But the point to make is that any test ban agreement
                        is designed by the Russians against the Chinese.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: Would we accept a threshold test ban?</p>
                    <p>Sonnenfeldt: That depends on the threshold and when it comes in.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: How long will it take us to test our <gloss target="#t_MIRV_1"
                            >MIRVs</gloss>?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LJM_1">Lodal</persName>: Around two years.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion unrelated to arms control.]</p>
                    <p>Sonnenfeldt: On the test ban, I think we have to string the Russians along
                        and offer some form of technical talks.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: That’s right. We’ll tell them we are not ready now, that we might
                        consider a threshold ban but that in any event we will have to have
                        technical talks before we move along any further. When are our <gloss
                            target="#t_MIRV_1">MIRV</gloss> tests going to be finished?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LJM_1">Lodal</persName>: Two years, but we might be
                        able to speed it up a little.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: What will be the magnitude of our <gloss target="#t_MIRV_1"
                            >MIRV</gloss> testing?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LJM_1">Lodal</persName>: Seismic level of five, which
                        allows us to test to 100 megatons. But the higher level you set, the easier
                        it is to cheat.</p>
                    <p>Sonnenfeldt: You could start with a high level and then eventually bring it
                        down.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: We obviously have to study how this will affect our weapons
                        program.</p>

                    <p>Sonnenfeldt: You also have their suggestions on environmental war, although
                        it is unclear. There is a <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> out but
                        unfortunately the paper won’t be out before your trip to Moscow. <persName

                    <p>Secretary: What is the <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> view? It is most
                        important.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CAD_1">Clift</persName>: They believe it would be a
                        mistake to limit our options, that it is a new field. They had some success
                        in Southeast Asia in controlling rainfall before and after the monsoon. They
                        especially don’t want to give up research and development in this area.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: I suppose we will get another proposal on this from Defense that
                        each country’s rainfall level must be far above present levels.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SBA_1">Scowcroft</persName>: The basic problem on
                        weather modification is that it is not subject to verification; we will
                        abide by it and they won’t.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: I can’t see verifying it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SBA_1">Scowcroft</persName>: We called it weather
                        reconnaissance in the Vietnam war.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: I am suspicious about their
                        motives.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: They have one of two things in mind. Either it is simply fluff and
                        they think it will be for the softheads, or they have discovered something
                        we don’t know. I am inclined to the former explanation.</p>

                    <p>Our previous paper on the nuclear test ban (Tab A) concluded that, of all
                        further limitations on testing, a threshold test ban (<gloss
                            target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss>) made most sense. At our meeting yesterday
                        you indicated agreement with this and raised specific questions regarding
                        the impact of a <gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss> on the Trident warhead.
                        Accordingly, this memorandum goes a bit further than the Tab A paper in
                        examining the implications of a <gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss> and
                        addresses your questions on Trident.</p>

                    <p>1. Asst. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> called in
                        Soviet Minister Counselor <persName corresp="#p_VY_1">Vorontsov</persName>
                        on March 21 to give him the following aide mémoire. Begin quote.</p>
                    <p>The United States has collected outside of the Soviet Union radioactive
                        material directly associated with the Soviet nuclear explosions of September
                        12 and October 27, 1973.</p>
                    <p>In view of paragraph 1 (B) of Article I of the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapons
                        Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water, the United States
                        wishes to draw the attention of the Government of the Soviet Union to this
                        matter and to the importance of due precautions <pb n="86" facs="0120"
                            xml:id="pg_86"/>to assure compliance with that treaty. The United States
                        considers these incidents to be most regrettable because of the relatively
                        large amounts of radioactive material collected outside the Soviet Union and
                        because ventings of radioactive material outside Soviet borders continue to
                        occur year after year.</p>
                    <p>Over the years the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has developed
                        increasingly effective measures to reduce the possibility of leakages of
                        radioactive material from underground nuclear explosions. During the past
                        few years we have taken even more rigorous precautions, and these measures
                        have proved especially effective. The United States Government would welcome
                        any pertinent information the Soviet Government could offer about these two
                        incidents and the recurrence of ventings of radioactive material outside
                        Soviet borders. End quote.</p>
                    <p>2. In commenting on the points contained in the aide mémoire, <persName
                            corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> said that we wish to stress
                        continued support for the Limited Test Ban Treaty and stated that the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        as principal nuclear powers should do their best to uphold the treaty.
                            <persName corresp="#p_VY_1">Vorontsov</persName> said that he would
                        transmit the aide mémoire to his authorities and that a reply would be
                        provided in due course.</p>

                        toward a relaxation of tension and a major improvement of relations between
                        them continues to be implemented successfully and brings tangible results.
                        The exceptional importance of the fundamental decisions adopted at the two

                        demonstrated.</p>

                    <p>“In the course of the discussions, considerable attention was given to the
                        problem of the future limitation of strategic arms. The sides agree that,
                        despite the complexity of this problem, there are possibilities for reaching
                        mutually acceptable solutions. They are determined to continue to make
                        energetic efforts to find such solutions. Certain other questions relative
                        to the area of arms limitation and disarmament were also considered.”

                        that there might be political reasons for the Soviet interest in a
                        comprehensive test ban. The Soviets probably thought there were some who

                    <p>The President has reviewed the study on <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        Policy Toward Purchase of Uranium Enrichment Services from the Soviet Union,

                        Under Secretaries Committee on December 4, 1973.</p>
                    <p>The President has approved the recommendations that the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> should take a neutral posture toward
                        Soviet sale of enrichment services and should consult with certain allies to
                        ascertain the necessity and feasibility of establishing some limit to these
                        purchases to avoid significant dependence on Soviet supply. The timing and
                        nature of the consultations should be carefully selected so as not to
                        conflict with other critical energy discussions. The consultations may be
                        incorporated, as <pb n="89" facs="0123" xml:id="pg_89"/>appropriate, in the
                        framework of the international Working Group on Uranium Enrichment of the
                        Energy Coordinating Group.</p>
                    <p>The President has also approved the recommendations that:</p>
                    <p>—The domestic company which has so requested to be allowed to purchase Soviet
                        enrichment services to fuel <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-built
                        nuclear plants abroad, and that future similar requests should be reviewed
                        on a case-by-case basis.</p>
                    <p>—The question of domestic purchase of foreign enrichment services should be
                        held in abeyance pending further analysis and developments.</p>

                    <p>In accordance with <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 235, the Under
                        Secretaries Committee has prepared the attached action program concerning
                        steps the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> might take with other
                        nations, in particular supplier nations, designed to further enhance our
                        security, nonproliferation and other objectives <pb n="90" facs="0124"
                            xml:id="pg_90"/>in light of the increased availability from growing
                        nuclear power industries of materials usable in nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>In preparing this program, the Committee focused on the two types of nuclear
                        weapons materials expected to be available in large quantities in the coming
                        years (highly enriched uranium and particularly plutonium) and on the
                        specialized technology and equipment needed to produce and separate these
                        materials. The details of the assessment and the conclusions reached by the
                        Committee are set forth in the attached executive summary of the interagency
                        report.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretaries Committee recommends that you approve the proposed
                        action program, comprising consultations with other countries, particularly
                        present and prospective suppliers (e.g., Germany, France, Canada, the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>, Japan and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss>), aimed at achieving agreement or understandings in the
                        following areas:</p>
                    <p>(1) Establishment of agreed international guidelines, preferably based on
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> practice, to ensure the physical
                        security of fissionable materials usable in nuclear weapons, whether
                        internationally transferred or indigenously produced. (A prompt <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> study on the possibility of developing an
                        international convention on minimum desirable physical security standards,
                        using the new <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> standards as a preferred
                        point of departure, should be undertaken, simultaneously with preliminary
                        bilateral discussions regarding these issues.)</p>
                    <p>(2) Establishment of common principles and precautions among potential
                        suppliers of sensitive enrichment technology or equipment.</p>
                    <p>(3) Agreement that a potential recipient nation’s adherence to the
                        Non-Proliferation Treaty shall be given due weight in decisions to supply
                        nuclear materials usable in weapons, or enrichment or reprocessing
                        technologies and equipment.</p>
                    <p>(4) Encouragement, where appropriate, of multinational enrichment, fuel
                        fabrication and reprocessing facilities.</p>
                    <p>(5) Consideration of denying materials and technology, or limiting the
                        accumulation of plutonium, in situations where conflict, seizure or
                        political instability could present special hazards.</p>
                    <p>(6) Encouragement of the adoption by other governments of export controls
                        (comparable to those implemented by the <gloss target="#t_USAEC_1"
                            >USAEC</gloss>) governing international activities of their citizens in
                        the fields of unclassified nuclear technology transfer and assistance
                        related to the production of special fissionable materials.</p>
                    <p>In recommending that you approve the proposed consultations with other
                        countries, the Committee recognizes that some other supplier nations will
                        probably be reluctant to adopt all of the measures the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> considers adequate. The timing and content
                        of the consultations will therefore need to be carefully developed, and the
                        Committee will report significant developments to you.</p>

                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion unrelated to weather modification.]</p>
                    <p>[<persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>:] Now I would like to turn
                        to another kind of environment and I hope that you can be more forthcoming.
                        What do you think of our proposal on making an agreement with respect to
                        changes in the environment?</p>
                    <p>Secretary: We are going to have a meeting on it soon.</p>
                    <p>Sonnenfeldt: A report is overdue but we should have it in a few days.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: I am not optimistic about the results.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName>: Why?</p>
                    <pb n="92" facs="0126" xml:id="pg_92"/>
                    <p>Secretary: Our people say that there is no way to verify what others will do
                        with respect to weather modification.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: I would like very much to
                        pretend that I did not hear your reply that you were not optimistic. So let
                        us both do what the fishermen in the story did. There were two fishermen who
                        met on the road and they were both hard of hearing. The first said “Are you
                        going fishing?” And the second replied “No, I am going fishing.” And the
                        first answered again, “No, I am going fishing.” So you can see, I did not
                        wish to hear you. Really, I am not at all encouraged. This is another area
                        where we can get into competition and the consequences will follow. Years
                        from now our successors will say “Why didn’t we take this matter up
                        before?”</p>
                    <p>Secretary: Can we get a report and answer by the end of the month? I will
                        have to have a meeting to hear what my geniuses have to say.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: This problem could consume
                        billions of dollars with only doubtful results if we get into
                        competition.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: What you want is a declaration not to use it?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: I don’t care about the
                        form. I have a completely open mind.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: Then <persName corresp="#p_JM_1">Jobert</persName> and the Chinese
                        can make speeches that we have agreed not to use it against each other but
                        we are free to use it against others. Am I right that you want to renounce
                        the use?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: We will consider any
                        effective form. A declaration might be a good way to proceed and contain the
                        substantive matters. You should not underestimate the effects. This could be
                        like the <gloss target="#t_ABM_1">ABM</gloss> but it could consume several
                        times more money. We will look back and say why didn’t we stop this. This is
                        the joint opinion of our political, scientific and military advisors,
                        especially our political and scientific people.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: It might be possible to agree to prohibit the use or the first use
                        or the production of agents or the belligerent use.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: We want to be specific and
                        concrete.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName>: Can’t we agree to enter
                        into negotiations at the summit?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: We could agree in principle
                        that this is the general direction we wish to move in.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RKW_1">Rush</persName>: What about peacetime peaceful
                        uses?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: Those are all right. If it
                        is to save a grain harvest, that is permissible.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: Let me look at this again. Perhaps we could announce at the summit
                        that we intend to enter into negotiations or to study this problem.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: I hope that you can stretch
                        your position and see that this is in our mutual interest.</p>
                    <pb n="93" facs="0127" xml:id="pg_93"/>
                    <p>Secretary: Your suggestions have been helpful. I think we might look into the
                        question of whether we can agree to a joint examination of how to avoid the
                        use of the environment for belligerent purposes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: With our geography we have
                        a lot of room for experimentation.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: You also have a lot of bad weather to export. I understand what
                        you are saying. I will think seriously about whether we can have a joint
                        examination.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: If we can move in this
                        direction it would be useful.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: There might be some symbolic value in this agreement. I will look
                        to our study and see what the problems are. Ever since Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RKW_1">Rush</persName> left the Pentagon they have been more
                        bellicose but you have given me an idea.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName>: Maybe we can have more
                        sunny days.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: I will study and see what can be considered. I am sympathetic. I
                        will let you know by May 1.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Chairman, before I make my formal statement I should like to express my
                        personal satisfaction at being back in Geneva with my old friends on the
                        Committee. I am saddened, however, by the loss of Ambassador Čvorović of
                        Yugoslavia, who was a great personal friend of mine and an esteemed
                        colleague. I wish to extend the condolences of my delegation to his family
                        and to the delegation of Yugoslavia.</p>
                    <p>On a happier note, I should like to extend my personal welcome and that of my
                        delegation to Madame <persName corresp="#p_TI_1">Thorsson</persName>,
                        Under-Secretary of State in the Government of Sweden: to Mr. Bier of Brazil;
                        Ambassador Nikolov of Bulgaria; Ambassador El-Erian of Egypt; Mr. Fantaye
                        Biftu of Ethiopia; Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MBC_1">Mishra</persName>
                        of India, and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CBA_1">Clark</persName> of
                        Nigeria. The appointment of such distinguished representatives to this
                        Committee testifies once again to the importance of the work of the
                        Conference on the Committee of Disarmament. I wish each of them success in
                        their efforts and look forward to working with them.</p>
                    <p>It is also a great pleasure to greet once again the Special Representative of
                        the Secretary-General, Ambassador Pastinen, who has been of so much help in
                        facilitating the Committee’s work.</p>
                    <p>We are also glad to welcome back the Alternate Representative of the
                        Secretary-General, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BR_1">Björnerstedt</persName>,
                        and look forward to renewed association with him.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I would like to extend my greetings, and that of my delegation, to
                        Mrs. Gill and the members of the Secretariat, who have been so helpful to us
                        all.</p>
                    <p>The Conference of the Committee on Disarmament (<gloss target="#t_CCD_1"
                            >CCD</gloss>) resumes its discussions at a time when the initiatives
                        taken in the past two years for peaceful settlement of outstanding
                        international problems have confirmed by their progress that we are entering
                        “an era of negotiation.”</p>
                    <p>One encouraging sign is the negotiating process now under way at the mutual
                        force reduction talks in Vienna, involving many of the countries present
                        here in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament. All of us realize
                        how complex it is to negotiate equitable reduc<pb n="95" facs="0129"
                            xml:id="pg_95"/>tions in troop levels in central Europe. Therefore none
                        of us expected that the countries participating in those talks could have
                        reached easy and early agreement on reductions which would be balanced so as
                        not to diminish the security of either side. Yet the talks have proceeded in
                        a constructive and serious fashion, and the proposals put forward by each
                        side have been subjected to the thorough examination that takes place when
                        both sides wish to achieve success. We in the Conference of the Committee on
                        Disarmament have every reason to hope that the negotiators in Vienna will
                        reach an agreement on a reduction of troop levels in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (<gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>)
                        between my country and the Soviet Union continue in an effort to place
                        additional controls on strategic offensive weapons systems and eventually to
                        reduce the number of these systems deployed by ourselves and the Soviet
                        Union. The Standing Consultative Commission on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"

                    <p>The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (<gloss
                            target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss>) has met here in Geneva for several
                        months. Although not directly concerned with arms control and disarmament,
                        it could contribute to relaxing tensions and enhancing security in Europe by
                        building further confidence between nations. Equally important, the <gloss
                            target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> could make a contribution towards
                        increased cooperation in Europe by adopting effective agreements in the
                        fields of economics, science and technology, and the environment. It could
                        also assist by agreements to increase human contacts, exchanges of
                        information and cultural and educational cooperation.</p>
                    <p>All of these negotiations owe something to the pioneering efforts of this
                        Committee, which set an example as a serious, effective multilateral group
                        dealing in a sustained way with the important issues that bear upon the
                        security of all States. The accomplishments of this Committee, which show
                        that effective international agreements require patience, perseverance,
                        thorough exploration of the issues and a determination to attain lasting
                        solutions, have provided a model for these other forums. We expect that
                        negotiations in these forums will in turn contribute to an atmosphere for
                        further progress in this Committee.</p>

                            [Footnote is in the original.]</note> the Federal Republic of Germany
                        has completed the parliamentary procedures for its ratification of the

                        Conference, which may influence the course of non-proliferation and peaceful
                        uses of nuclear energy for some years ahead. We are also pleased to note
                        that both Sudan and Gabon have adhered to the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                            >NPT</gloss> in recent months. Both States, by virtue of their adherence

                            >IAEA</gloss> Board of Governors, are now members of the <gloss

                    <p>I should now like to turn to some of the important tasks currently before
                        this Committee. In regard to the Committee’s work on chemical weapons
                            (<gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>), delegations will recall that in
                        our last session my delegation discussed some of the problems and
                        considerations we believe should be taken into account by the Committee. We
                        look forward this session to hearing the views of other delegations on our
                        statements and on other issues involved.</p>
                    <p>We remain firmly committed to the objective of achieving effective
                        international restraints on chemical weapons. It will be recalled that in
                        August 1973 I told the Committee that my delegation had not submitted a
                        specific <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> treaty proposal because we had
                        not been able to find any approach which we could be confident would resolve
                        the difficulties surrounding this subject. My Government has continued its
                        studies of all the issues related to possible restraints on <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>, has carefully studied the statements and
                        working papers submitted by <pb n="97" facs="0131" xml:id="pg_97"/>various
                        delegations in our last session, and is determined to continue its efforts
                        in this area.</p>
                    <p>We understand and share the desire of the Committee to make rapid progress in
                        controlling chemical weapons; but we continue to believe that genuine
                        progress can only be made by a careful study of all the complex problems
                        inherent in such control. During this session we hope that other delegations
                        will join us in further examination of possibilities for achieving
                        adequately verified prohibitions on <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>We also remain fully committed to the objective of a Comprehensive Test Ban
                        with adequate verification, which we continue to believe would require some
                        on-site inspection. We intend to continue discussion of test-ban issues
                        during the 1974 session.</p>
                    <p>Since the Committee last met, we have continued our research programme on the
                        problems of detecting and identifying underground explosions by seismic
                        means. In particular, the major elements of the research programme described
                        to the Committee last July<note n="7" xml:id="d41fn7">Ibid., pp. 376–402.
                            [Footnote is in the original.]</note> are being actively pursued. Eight
                        sites have now been selected for the installation of our new Seismic
                        Research Observatories. International interest in our seismic data
                        management system and in the new arrangements for the prompt exchange of
                        seismic data has been most encouraging. A new large-aperture seismic array
                        is now being installed in Iran. Finally, we have continued our studies on
                        the utility of Unmanned Seismic Observatories.</p>
                    <p>As we consider the talks ahead we should, I think, be mindful of the
                        Committee’s responsibility to engage in a serious and constructive
                        examination of a wide range of multilateral arms-control issues with a view
                        to reaching agreements that promote international peace and security. In
                        this regard I should like to call the Committee’s attention to the
                        desirability of considering the question of effective restraints on
                        conventional weapons. We are all aware that these weapons account for the
                        largest part of the world’s military spending—which this year is in excess
                        of $216 billion—that there is a rapid proliferation of numbers and types of
                        these weapons, and that their use has accounted for an enormous casualty
                        toll in conflicts since the second world war.</p>
                    <p>A group of experts appointed by the Secretary-General is today beginning a
                        technical study here in Geneva of military budgets. This summer the
                        International Committee of the Red Cross hopes to convene a group of
                        government experts to study the question of prohibition or restriction of
                        the use of conventional weapons which may cause unnecessary suffering or
                        have indiscriminate effects.</p>
                    <pb n="98" facs="0132" xml:id="pg_98"/>
                    <p>These developments demonstrate the growing interest in possible restraints on
                        conventional weapons. My delegation therefore believes it is timely to begin
                        to study seriously the question of restraints on conventional weapons in the
                        Conference of the Committee on Disarmament. In the past my delegation has
                        submitted for the consideration of the Committee a number of principles and
                        guidelines related to restraints on conventional weapons. We would welcome
                        the comments and views of others on this subject. Further consideration by
                        the Committee could eventually result in effective controls over these
                        weapons to the general benefit.</p>

                        the President, in <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 165, adopted the
                        following civilian weather modification policies: (1) research and
                        development will continue; (2) international cooperation and understanding
                        will be furthered and the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> will conduct
                        programs with <pb n="99" facs="0133" xml:id="pg_99"/>maximum openness; (3)
                        requests for <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> assistance will not be
                        encouraged, but will be considered on merits by the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"
                            >NSC</gloss> Under Secretaries Committee established to monitor <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> weather modification activities; and (4)
                        no climate modification operations will be conducted without specific
                        Presidential approval. A policy decision on military applications was
                        deferred and no action was taken on regulatory legislation.</p>
                    <p>Since these decisions were reached, the Senate has passed a resolution urging
                        that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> seek an international treaty
                        prohibiting the use of weather modification as a weapon of war. To date, no
                        Executive Branch action has been initiated. Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_PCDB_1">Pell</persName> held hearings on the subject in
                        January 1974; in addition DoD provided a classified briefing to Senator
                            <persName corresp="#p_PCDB_1">Pell</persName>’s Subcommittee in
                        Executive Session in March 1974.</p>
                    <p>The Introduction concludes with requisite technical definitions applicable
                        throughout the study.</p>
                    <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Current Capabilities:</hi> At present, no capability
                        exists to alter the environment in a controlled (militarily useful) manner
                        through oceanographic, terrestrial, or ionospheric modification techniques.
                        Accordingly, this section addresses weather modification activities in fog,
                        precipitation, severe storms, and inadvertent weather modification. The
                        conclusion is that even in the cases of the most advanced knowledge in
                        weather modification technology (fog and precipitation), the
                        state-of-the-art is minimal.</p>
                    <p>III. <hi rend="italic">Current Operational Programs:</hi> Only two DoD
                        programs are operational: Army warm fog dissipation using helicopters, and
                        Air Force cold fog dissipation using airborne dry ice and ground-based
                        propane seeding.</p>
                    <p>IV. <hi rend="italic">Research and Development Programs:</hi> This section
                        describes in detail on-going DoD programs, as follows:</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Weather Modification:</hi> Army; three small atmospheric
                        programs (two in fog dissipation; one in dust control); Navy; four programs
                        (one in precipitation modification, one in fog dissipation and suppression,
                        one in inadvertent weather modification, and one in mathematical simulation
                        applicable to weather modification; Air Force; one atmospheric research
                        project in dissipation of warm fog and low stratus clouds.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Climate Modification:</hi> One <gloss target="#t_ARPA_1"
                            >ARPA</gloss> computer program to exploit current knowledge in
                        atmospheric sciences.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Oceanographic Modification:</hi> No DoD programs.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Terrestrial Modification:</hi> No DoD programs. <gloss
                            target="#t_ARPA_1">ARPA</gloss> has sponsored research in control of
                        earthquakes related to underground nuclear test detection.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Ionospheric:</hi> No DoD programs. However, all the
                        Military Departments are assessing the impact of ionospheric variations on
                        communications and surveillance.</p>
                    <pb n="100" facs="0134" xml:id="pg_100"/>
                    <p>V. <hi rend="italic">Potential Military Utility and Significance:</hi>
                        Offensive and defensive applications of weather modification are described,
                        pointing out the possibility of both local and/or large scale techniques.
                        Offensive potential includes harassment, damage inflicting, supporting, and
                        blocking operations. Defensive potential includes direct defensive,
                        supporting, rescue, and damage avoiding operations.</p>
                    <p>Operations of major military significance are described (change levels of
                        precipitation; stimulate or suppress fog; and intensify or suppress
                        cyclones).</p>
                    <p>It is concluded that climate modification has limited military application
                        because the magnitude of the operation is unpredictable and such activity
                        would probably be highly overt.</p>
                    <p>It is concluded that Oceanographic Modification also has limited military
                        application principally because of the scope of operation required to
                        produce significant results.</p>
                    <p>With respect to terrestrial modifications, it is concluded that current
                        techniques could have significant military application in masking
                        underground nuclear testing, and in aircraft, missile and submarine
                        navigation.</p>
                    <p>Finally, Ionospheric Modification could have significant military application
                        in disruption of radio communications and missile launch detection,
                        tracking, and discrimination.</p>
                    <p>VI. <hi rend="italic">Alternatives:</hi> This section describes potential (or
                        actual) techniques which permit military operations “in spite of” adverse
                        weather including radar bombing, infrared sensors, improved instrumented
                        landing systems, and improved “all weather” weapons. Additionally, in the
                        event an enemy achieves a significant weather modification capability, which
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is not able to counter through
                        weather technology, alternatives to the threat mentioned include the full
                        range of military capabilities now available from conventional war through
                        strategic nuclear options.</p>
                    <p>The requirement for continued <gloss target="#t_RD_1">R&amp;D</gloss> is
                        stressed as essential lest the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> face
                        technological surprise in the military application of environmental
                        modification.</p>

                    <p>C. Statement of the American Meteorological Society</p>

                    <p>The Under Secretaries Committee (<gloss target="#t_USC_1">USC</gloss>) has
                        reported to you that several <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> companies
                        are seeking authorization to negotiate the sale of nuclear power reactors
                        and uranium fuel to the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> (Tab B). No
                        Communist country has purchased Western power reactors, and as far as the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> is concerned, the necessary
                        intergovernmental agreements regulating the sales and transfer of nuclear
                        equipment and fuel are not in place.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_USC_1">USC</gloss>’s study has concluded that the
                        export of light water reactors and slightly enriched uranium fuel would be
                        consistent with our policy of facilitating the development of trade with the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>, would have no adverse strategic
                        implications, and would not be contrary to our obligations under the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>In order that these exports might proceed, the <gloss target="#t_USC_1"
                            >USC</gloss> recommends that we should indicate to the Chinese our
                        willingness to conclude a standard bilateral intergovernmental agreement for
                        nuclear transfers. This agreement would provide for the application of
                        safeguards, as we require for all nuclear exports to any country.</p>
                    <p>Future requests for nuclear exports to Communist countries would continue to
                        be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
                    <p>I recommend that you approve the <gloss target="#t_USC_1">USC</gloss>’s
                        recommendations, including the imposition of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> safeguards, until such time that the <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> takes its seat in the International Atomic
                        Energy Agency (<gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>) and becomes subject
                        to its safeguards. (If the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>,
                        subsequently, were to withdraw from the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1"
                            >IAEA</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> safeguards would
                        again become <pb n="102" facs="0136" xml:id="pg_102"/>operative.) The Joint
                        Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy would be informed if the <gloss

                    <p>The President has directed that a study be made of possible international
                        restraints on environmental warfare.</p>
                    <p>The study should specifically examine the advantages and disadvantages of
                        promptly initiating discussions with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss>, or in a broader international context, on such
                        restraints, and should address the following:</p>
                    <p>—The definition of “environmental warfare” and related terms for such
                        discussions, including options for narrowing the area of discussion to those
                        environmental modification techniques considered practical in this
                        decade.</p>
                    <pb n="103" facs="0137" xml:id="pg_103"/>
                    <p>—The military utility of various forms of environmental modification,
                        including technically and/or politically acceptable distinctions between
                        hostile and non-hostile use.</p>
                    <p>—The state of Soviet development in environmental modification and its
                        relationship to their capability to engage in environmental warfare.</p>
                    <p>—The options for various levels of restraint (for example, all use, first
                        use, hostile use, development of capabilities, <gloss target="#t_RD_1">
                            <gloss target="#t_RD_1">R&amp;D</gloss>
                        </gloss>) and how such restraints might be defined in terms of capabilities
                        or intent. For each of the restraint options, assessment should be made of
                        verification possibilities and their security implications, and the impact
                        on our civil activities and programs in environmental modification.</p>
                    <p>—Alternative forms an agreement might take (for example, bilateral or
                        multilateral renunciation, treaty, moratoria), possible fora for conducting
                        discussions, and the advantages and disadvantages of various positions the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> might take in discussions.</p>
                    <p>This study should draw upon (1) the 1972 Report of the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> Under Secretaries Committee on
                        International Aspects of Weather Modification, (2) the report being prepared
                        by the Department of Defense on the military aspects of environmental and
                        geophysical modification activity, and (3) the recent briefing by the
                        Department of Defense on weather modification activity in Southeast
                        Asia.</p>
                    <p>The President has directed that this study be undertaken by the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> Under Secretaries Committee, with its
                        membership supplemented by representatives of the Arms Control and
                        Disarmament Agency and the Department of Commerce.</p>
                    <p>Because of the sensitivity of the subject, knowledge of the study and
                        participation in its preparation should be kept on a strict need-to-know
                        basis. The study should be submitted no later than May 13, 1974, for
                        consideration by the President.</p>

                        <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 235, issued in October 1973,
                        established <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy regarding the supply
                        of large quantities of highly enriched uranium (<gloss target="#t_HEU_1"
                            >HEU</gloss>) to foreign countries for a type of power reactor being

                        on a case-by-case basis and that any recipient must have acceptable physical
                        security measures in effect.</p>
                    <p>In addition, <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 235 directed the <gloss

                            target="#t_USC_1">USC</gloss>) to prepare an action program outlining
                        steps the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> might take with other
                        nations, particularly supplier nations, concerning the security,
                        nonproliferation, and other problems associated with the increasingly large
                        amounts of weapons useable and highly toxic materials from growing nuclear
                        power industries.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_USC_1">USC</gloss>’s report for the President focuses
                        on the two key materials—plutonium (Pu) and <gloss target="#t_HEU_1"
                            >HEU</gloss>, which are expected to become available in hundreds of
                        thousands of kilograms in the next two decades—and on the specialized
                        technology and equipment needed to produce these materials (report, Tab
                        C/USC Chairman’s Memorandum, Tab B).</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_USC_1">USC</gloss> recommends that the President
                        approve consultations with other countries (particularly present or
                        potential suppliers such as Germany, France, Canada, <gloss target="#t_UK_1"
                            >UK</gloss>, Japan, and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>) with
                        the following objectives:</p>
                    <p>1. Establishment of agreed international guidelines, preferably based on
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> practice, to ensure the physical
                        security of weapons useable materials whether internationally transferred or
                        indigenously <pb n="105" facs="0139" xml:id="pg_105"/>produced. (A prompt
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> study of possible provisions for an
                        international convention would be undertaken simultaneously with preliminary
                        bilateral consultations with key countries.)</p>
                    <p>2. Establishment of common principles among potential suppliers of sensitive
                        enrichment technology or equipment.</p>
                    <p>3. Agreement that a potential recipient’s adherence to the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> be weighed in decisions to supply weapons
                        useable materials or enrichment or reprocessing technologies and
                        equipment.</p>
                    <p>4. Encouragement, where appropriate, of multinational enrichment, fuel
                        fabrication and reprocessing facilities.</p>
                    <p>5. Consideration of denying materials, technology and equipment in situations
                        where conflict or instability could present special hazards.</p>
                    <p>6. Encouragement that other countries adopt export controls, comparable to
                        those of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, governing international
                        activities of their citizens in the fields of unclassified nuclear
                        technology transfer and assistance related to the production of special
                        fissionable materials.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_USC_1">USC</gloss> notes that some supplier nations may
                        be reluctant to adopt all the measures the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> considers necessary, and that the timing and content of
                        the consultations will have to be carefully developed in light of this
                        potential reluctance and other nuclear energy-related discussions.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_USC_1">USC</gloss>’s recommendations are soundly based.
                        The spread of weapons useable and highly toxic materials is a worldwide
                        problem in terms of transportation and storage as nuclear power industries
                        grow and exporting proliferates. Of course, even if all the above measures
                        were successfully negotiated, potential problems associated with increasing
                        quantities of nuclear materials would remain. Nonetheless, such measures
                        should help make the general problem of materials control and security more
                        manageable, and we should surely attempt to establish internationally those
                        basic security measures and precautions which we consider necessary. (For
                        example, the President just recently approved the major upgrading of and
                        continuing priority effort for <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> physical
                        security measures.)</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> at Tab A would approve the <gloss
                            target="#t_USC_1">USC</gloss> recommendations and request progress
                        reports. It also asks State and <gloss target="#t_AEC_1">AEC</gloss> to look

                        issue is whether or not we should significantly improve our presently
                        limited <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> retaliatory capability by
                        producing and stockpiling binary chemical weapons. All indications are that
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_JCS_1"
                            >JCS</gloss> will support acquisition of binary chemical weapons while
                        State and <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> will oppose it.</p>
                    <p>The binary question is already being addressed in part on the <persName

                        House Foreign Affairs Committee just concluded extensive hearings dealing

                            >ACDA</gloss> (Ikle) testified for the Administration on the various
                        subjects. (I understand that General <persName corresp="#p_WJA_1"
                            >Wickham</persName> may have had some concern about <persName

                        were cleared here and with the other interested agencies. Nothing in

                        anyone cause for concern.) The Subcommittee’s report is expected to be out

                        discussed above. The central issue now is whether to support a ban on
                        further production of <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> agents. State and
                            <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> have recommended such a ban.
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_JCS_1"
                            >JCS</gloss> have opposed it primarily because it would preclude
                        significantly improving our <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> retaliatory
                        capability with binary weapons.</p>
                    <p>You will recall that during the April discussions in Moscow, General
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> suggested that we
                        agree to negotiate a ban on the production of lethal <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                        noted that such a ban could not be adequately verified and that we would
                        look into the matter.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Geneva Protocol.</hi> The Protocol in effect prohibits
                        first use in war of chemical and biological weapons. In 1970 the President
                        submitted the Protocol for the Senate’s consent to ratification with the
                        understanding that it does not prohibit first use in war of tear gas and
                        herbicides. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee strongly supports the
                        Protocol but disagrees with our understanding on these two agents. In 1971
                        the Committee asked the President to reconsider this position and was
                        informed that we have the issue under study.</p>
                    <p>The central issue is whether we wish to preserve the first use option for
                        warfare uses of tear gas and herbicides. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> decided not to submit an earlier study for
                        decision. Pursuant to a directive in November, an updated study and all
                        agency views except State’s have been forwarded. <gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                            >DOD</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> support
                        preserving the first use option for these agents. <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1"
                            >ACDA</gloss> and probably State believe we should be willing to
                        relinquish this first use option. There will probably be no favorable Senate
                        action on the Protocol unless there is some change in our position.</p>
                    <p>

                                >BWC</gloss>).</hi> The President submitted the <gloss
                            target="#t_BWC_1">BWC</gloss> for the Senate’s consent to ratification
                        in 1972. The <gloss target="#t_BWC_1">BWC</gloss> expressly reaffirms the
                        Protocol’s significance and objectives. The Senate Foreign Relations
                        Committee may continue to defer action on the <gloss target="#t_BWC_1"
                            >BWC</gloss> until there is an Administration response on the Protocol
                        issue. Since 30 countries have already ratified the <gloss target="#t_BWC_1"
                            >BWC</gloss>, ratification by the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>,
                            <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss> is all that is needed to bring it into effect. The <gloss
                            target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss> are ready to ratify. Prompt and favorable Senate action on
                        the <gloss target="#t_BWC_1">BWC</gloss> can be expected if the Protocol
                        issue were resolved satisfactorily.</p>
                    <p>As noted in my memorandum to you on May 15, <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1"
                            >ACDA</gloss> believes we should move now on the Protocol issue to try
                        to achieve ratification of the Protocol and the <gloss target="#t_BWC_1"
                            >BWC</gloss> prior to any summit. State would concur in the objective
                        but would probably not concur in <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1"
                            >Iklé</persName>’s suggested way to resolve the Protocol issue.</p>

                        mining and earth moving. Singh asked that there be no misunderstanding that
                        India remains absolutely committed against the use of nuclear energy for
                        military purposes.</p>
                    <p>2. The Chargé replied that he believed that this news would be received with
                        considerable shock in Washington. Explained that as Kewal Singh knew, the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> did not believe it possible to
                        distinguish between explosions for peaceful and military purposes. Singh
                        repeated that India was absolutely opposed to military uses. There were
                        large scale possibilities for use in mineral exploitation. India did not
                        sign <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> because it was opposed to
                        discrimination against non-nuclear powers. It was nevertheless firmly
                        committed not to use nuclear energy for other than peaceful purposes. India
                        did not have the economic capability to devote to military use. Singh
                        concluded by stating his devout hope that this event will not interfere with
                        improving <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-India relations.</p>

                    <p>“The United States has always been against nuclear proliferation. This

                        will have on world stability. This remains the position of the United States

                    <p>The central issue in the Geneva Protocol study is whether we wish to preserve
                        the option to initiate use of tear gas and herbicides in war, or whether we
                        are willing to forego this option in order to break the impasse with the
                        Senate Foreign Relations Committee and thereby achieve favorable Senate
                        action on ratification of the Geneva Protocol. You asked me to check on
                        State’s position.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">State</hi> (Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RKW_1"
                            >Rush</persName>) believes we should be willing to forego the first use
                        option for these agents. His memorandum is expected here this week.</p>
                    <p>All other agency positions have already been submitted. You will recall that

                    <p>State and <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> differ, however, on <hi
                            rend="italic">implementing tactics</hi>. State will say that we should
                        consider first use prohibited against parties which confirm a reciprocal
                        obligation. <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss>’s position stated that we
                        should consider first use of these agents covered by the Protocol from the
                        date of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> ratification. Renouncing first
                        use as a matter of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> national policy (not
                        as a matter covered by the Protocol) is also acceptable to <gloss
                            target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>As discussed earlier, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>
                        recently wrote the President seeking approval to see if the <persName
                            corresp="#p_HRC_1">Hill</persName> would accept renunciation of only
                        certain, essentially offensive, uses. State’s views on this suggestion are
                        not known. State would probably not object to renouncing first use as a
                        matter of national policy, but it is doubtful State would find <persName
                            corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>’s suggested renunciation of only
                        certain uses acceptable.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">
                            <gloss target="#t_OSD_1">OSD</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_JCS_1"

                        </hi> strongly recommend preserving the first use option for these agents.
                        However, if it is decided not to preserve the first use option, then <gloss
                            target="#t_OSD_1">OSD</gloss> would prefer that we (1) renounce first
                        use as a matter of national policy, and/or (2) initiate a separate treaty
                        banning their first use in war.</p>
                    <p>We should have a package staffed ready for decision sometime next week.</p>

                            target="#t_USC_1">USC</gloss>) to prepare an action program outlining
                        steps we might take with other nations, particularly supplier nations,
                        concerning the security and other problems associated with the increasingly
                        large amounts of weapons useable and highly toxic materials from growing
                        nuclear power industries.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_USC_1">USC</gloss> recommends (Tab B) that you approve
                        consultations with other countries (particularly present or potential
                        suppliers such as Germany, France, Canada, <gloss target="#t_UK_1"
                            >UK</gloss>, Japan, and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>) with
                        the following objectives:</p>
                    <pb n="113" facs="0147" xml:id="pg_113"/>
                    <p>1. Establishment of agreed international guidelines, preferably based on
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> practice, to ensure the physical
                        security of internationally transferred or indigenously produced weapons
                        useable materials.</p>
                    <p>2. Establishment of common principles among potential suppliers of sensitive
                        enrichment technology or equipment.</p>
                    <p>3. Agreement that a potential recipient’s adherence to the Non-Proliferation
                        Treaty be weighed in decisions to supply weapons useable materials or
                        enrichment or reprocessing technologies and equipment.</p>
                    <p>4. Encouragement, where appropriate, of multinational enrichment, fuel
                        fabrication and reprocessing facilities.</p>
                    <p>5. Consideration of denying materials, technology and equipment in situations
                        where special hazards are present.</p>
                    <p>6. Encouragement that other countries adopt export controls, comparable to
                        those of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, governing international
                        activities of their citizens in the fields of unclassified nuclear
                        technology transfer and assistance.</p>
                    <p>Some supplier nations may be reluctant to adopt all the measures the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> considers necessary. However, the spread
                        of weapons useable and highly toxic materials is a worldwide problem as
                        nuclear power industries grow and exporting proliferates. Even if all the
                        above measures were established, potential problems regarding these
                        materials would remain. However, these measures should make the general
                        problem of materials control and security more manageable, and we should
                        surely attempt to establish internationally those basic security measures
                        and precautions which we consider necessary.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">I recommend</hi> therefore that you approve the <gloss

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Implications of the Indian Test</p>
                    <p>India’s explosion of a nuclear device May 18, even though labeled a peaceful
                        nuclear explosion (<gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>), represents a
                        setback to our non-proliferation efforts. By itself, it will not prompt
                        other near-nuclear powers to follow suit, but India’s action makes it easier
                        for them to do so should they decide that a nuclear capability, either as a
                        “prestige <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>” or a weapon, would be in
                        their national interest.</p>
                    <p>The explosion also has implications for the Simla process of political
                        accommodation in South Asia, although both India and Pakistan have now
                        reaffirmed their support for that process.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Reactions to the Indian Test</p>
                    <p>While the Soviets share our concern about proliferation, they are wary of
                        damaging their close ties with India and have refrained from any public
                        comment. The Soviet news accounts have stressed the “peaceful” character of
                        the test. The Chinese, who have long asserted the right of nations to test,
                        have also not commented. Our intelligence suggests they do not regard the
                        Indian test as a serious short-run threat.</p>
                    <p>Regionally, the impact has been hardest on Pakistan. Islamabad has asked the
                        major powers, including the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, for
                        protection against Indian nuclear “blackmail” and has made veiled
                        suggestions of developing its own testing program. Given its limited
                        capability, this would probably take as long as a decade barring external
                        assistance. The Pakistanis are also urging an easing of <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> arms supply restrictions to meet an
                        increased Indian military threat.</p>
                    <p>Elsewhere, there have been wide expressions of concern about the spread of
                        nuclear weapons, criticism of India for its choice of priorities, <pb
                            n="115" facs="0149" xml:id="pg_115"/>and skepticism about India’s
                        professed peaceful intentions. The strongest reactions have come from Canada
                        and Japan. Ottawa has suspended all nuclear cooperation and assistance, and
                        asked other governments, including the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>,
                        to do the same. Japan is considering a reduction in economic aid, in
                        addition to its public condemnation.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Indian Capabilities/Intentions</p>
                    <p>What the Indians hope to achieve is a sort of major power status on the
                        cheap, through an inexpensive prestige <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        which also buoys sagging domestic morale. They have reaffirmed their
                        intention not to go the nuclear weapons route.</p>
                    <p>For the time being, the Indians lack a credible delivery system—except
                        against Pakistan where they do not need nuclear weapons to assert
                        overwhelming superiority. They have neither long-range bombers nor an
                        intermediate range ballistic missile capability.</p>
                    <p>The fledgling Indian space program aims at launching a satellite in the end
                        of the 1970s. Unless they obtain significant foreign technical assistance,
                        India probably cannot develop an <gloss target="#t_IRBM_1">IRBM</gloss>
                        until the early/mid 1980s. Moreover, to do so requires a major commitment of
                        resources, perhaps more than $3 billion, a quantum jump from the present

                    <p>Limiting the number of nuclear weapons powers remains a major <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> interest. The acquisition of nuclear
                        devices by additional states has an adverse impact on global stability and
                        hence our security.</p>
                    <p>With regard to our proliferation interests, our objectives are (a) that
                        countries close to adherence to the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>
                        (Germany, Italy and Japan) not now alter their plans; (b) that other nuclear
                        threshold powers (Israel, Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, and South Africa in
                        particular, as well as Pakistan) not follow the Indian example; (c) that
                        international safeguards systems be strengthened; and (d) that India eschew
                        the development of a sophisticated weapons and delivery system.</p>
                    <p>Attaining a peaceful and stable South Asia is also a relevant <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> concern. To this end, we have supported
                        the independence and integrity of Pakistan, have sought a better basis for
                        relations with India, and have encouraged South Asian efforts toward
                        normalization. Our objective is thus to minimize the damage to South Asian
                        relationships and to prevent reversal of the promising trend toward
                        subcontinental stability.</p>

                        <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Options</p>
                    <p>In this study we have set forth a range of possible actions that relate
                        primarily to India; a companion analysis (<gloss target="#t_NSSM_1"
                            >NSSM</gloss> 202) will deal <pb n="116" facs="0150" xml:id="pg_116"
                        />with broader nonproliferation issues, especially options to strengthen the
                        international safeguards system. In updating <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1"
                            >NSSM</gloss> 156, we have assumed that prevention of further
                        proliferation remains a major <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> global
                        interest and that this transcends our desire for better relations with
                        India.</p>
                    <p>Our options can be grouped into four clusters as follows:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Measures with India to Discourage or Inhibit Others from
                            following the Indian Nuclear Example:</hi> These range from (a) doing
                        virtually nothing, (b) reviewing our nuclear cooperation, including an
                        effort to obtain tighter guarantees on the supply of enriched uranium to the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-financed Tarapur power reactors
                        (which are under full <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards);
                        (c) suspending all nuclear cooperation (as Canada has done); to (d) more
                        extensive countermeasures, including possible withdrawal of our willingness
                        to renew economic assistance.</p>
                    <p>Measures limited in scope specifically to the nuclear field would upset the
                        Indians, but would probably not seriously damage bilateral relations over
                        the longer term. Our failure to take any action, especially in light of the
                        Canadian démarche, would be seen as signalling that the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> no longer took the proliferation issue
                        seriously. [The Director-General of the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1"
                            >IAEA</gloss> has already expressed concern about the lack of a vigorous
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> (and also <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss>) response.]</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Measures to Discourage India from Developing
                            Sophisticated Nuclear Weapons and Delivery System:</hi> These are of two
                        sorts: the first, to consider finding a niche for India as a non-weapon
                        nuclear state, including possible limited <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> cooperation with India in a <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> program in order to have some influence over its directions
                        and lessen incentives to focus on a nuclear weapons program; and the second,
                        to make an Indian decision to seek a sophisticated weapons and delivery
                        system as costly and as time consuming as possible. The first raises a
                        number of serious problems that bear more broadly on our nonproliferation
                        policies (<gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 202). The second includes a
                        careful review of current <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> controls over
                        exports of material and technology to the Indian atomic energy and space
                        programs. As a practical matter, the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                        already imposes restrictions under existing export control policy, but a
                        review seems called for to prevent loopholes, especially with regard to
                        India’s acquiring a ballistic missile or long-range bomber capability.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Measures to Strengthen Non-Proliferation and
                            International Safeguards System:</hi> These measures would apply to all
                        countries, not just India, and are to be considered primarily in <gloss
                            target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 202. The fact that India almost
                        certainly acquired its plutonium from the unsafeguarded CIRUS research
                        reactor supplied by Canada points up the importance of the safeguards
                        system. The risk that India will share its nuclear explosive technology with
                        other states must also be addressed.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Measures Relating to South Asia Stability:</hi> Badly
                        shaken by the nuclear test, Pakistan is seeking security assurances from the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and <pb n="117" facs="0151"
                            xml:id="pg_117"/>other major powers, a relaxation of <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> arms restrictions, and possibly in time
                        its own nuclear test program. Our options on assurances/arms supply include
                        the following:</p>
                    <p>a. <hi rend="italic">Do Nothing.</hi> Failure to provide Pakistan any
                        reassurance could prompt them to move toward their own nuclear program, as
                        well as seriously affect <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Pakistani
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Calm Pakistanis through Verbal Assurances but No New
                            Commitments.</hi> We could recognize Pak fears as real, if overdrawn,
                        and seek to convince them, perhaps with Iranian help, that we would be
                        concerned by Indian nuclear “blackmail”. We could consider some form of
                        public statement.</p>
                    <p>c. <hi rend="italic">Limited Change in South Asia Arms Policy.</hi> We could
                        somewhat ease our arms supply policy to permit enhancement of Pakistan’s
                        defensive capability, especially as it relates to defense against nuclear
                        attack by India’s Canberra bomber force. In combination with verbal
                        assurances, this would steady Pak nerves, although it would almost certainly
                        prompt Indian criticism.</p>
                    <p>d. <hi rend="italic">Remove All Restrictions on Arms Deliveries to South
                            Asia.</hi> This would be welcomed by the Pakistanis, but trigger strong
                        Indian resentment, seriously setting back Indo-American relations and
                        perhaps India’s willingness to continue its efforts toward more normal
                        relations with Pakistan. We believe such a step by the administration would
                        be sharply criticized in Congress.</p>
                    <p>e. <hi rend="italic">Provide Pakistan a Formal Nuclear Umbrella.</hi> This
                        would extend <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> commitments, encounter
                        sharp domestic opposition and set an unwelcome precedent that might prompt
                        similar requests from other nations.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Public Posture</p>
                    <p>Our public stance should be geared to <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                        decisions on the various options. So far, in public statements <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> spokesmen have strictly limited themselves
                        to the general position that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                        continues to oppose nuclear proliferation because of the adverse impact it
                        has on global stability. This puts us between Soviet/Chinese non-statements
                        and Canadian/Japanese condemnation; the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        media have taken a line more critical of India than the official <gloss
                            target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> position.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Action of Other Countries</p>
                    <p>Since the Canadians have taken the lead in urging international
                        counter-measures, their proposals—basically to suspend all nuclear
                        cooperation with India—form the basepoint for our review. The <gloss
                            target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> response to the Canadian initiative will
                        have a substantial effect on how the Germans, Japanese, and other major
                        nuclear equipment suppliers react. Once the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                            >USG</gloss> policy review is completed, we should consider
                        consultations with friendly governments.</p>
                    <pb n="118" facs="0152" xml:id="pg_118"/>
                    <p>France and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> have particular
                        importance in any measures vis-à-vis the Indians. In the past, the French
                        refused to cooperate in international controls. We do not yet know if the
                        new government will modify this policy in light of the Indian test. If it
                        did, the chances for effective international action would be greatly
                        improved. The Soviets have not been publicly willing to chastise the
                        Indians, but have also not cooperated with Delhi in developing a military
                        nuclear or ballistic missile capability. It would be useful to consult with
                        the Soviets, especially within the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>
                        context, where they have often echoed our concerns about the dangers of
                        proliferation.</p>
                    <p>China’s posture, of major importance to the Pakistanis, will reflect both its
                        reluctance to get out ahead of Pakistan on South Asian matters and its
                        traditional opposition to big power assurances.</p>

                    <p>The President has reviewed the report of the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"
                            >NSC</gloss> Under Secretaries Committee (<gloss target="#t_USC_1"
                            >USC</gloss>), prepared in response to <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1"
                            >NSDM</gloss> 235 and forwarded by the <gloss target="#t_USC_1"
                            >USC</gloss> Chairman on April 5, 1974, outlining steps the United
                        States could take with other nations concerning the problems associated with
                        the increased availability of weapons useable materials from the growth and
                        dissemination of nuclear power industries.</p>
                    <p>The President has approved the recommended consultations with other
                        countries—particularly present or potential suppliers of materials,
                        technology and equipment—with the objectives detailed in the <gloss
                            target="#t_USC_1">USC</gloss> report.</p>
                    <p>The initial consultations should emphasize but not necessarily be limited to
                        the need for: (1) establishing agreed international guidelines, preferably
                        based on <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> practice, to ensure the
                        physical security of weapons useable and highly toxic materials whether
                        internationally transferred or indigenously produced; (2) reaching some
                        common principles regarding the supply of sensitive enrichment technology or
                        equipment; (3) avoiding or applying stricter terms for supply in situations
                        where special hazards could be present; and (4) encouraging, where
                        appropriate, multinational enrichment, fuel fabrication and reprocessing
                        facilities.</p>
                    <p>The Department of State, in coordination with the Atomic Energy Commission
                        (and other interested agencies when appropriate), will have primary
                        responsibility for the conduct of these consultations and for reporting
                        significant developments.</p>
                    <p>In addition, the President has directed that a prompt study of possible
                        provisions for an international convention concerned with physical security
                        guidelines be conducted by an Ad Hoc Group, chaired by a representative of
                        the Atomic Energy Commission and comprising representatives of the
                        addressees. In addition, the Ad Hoc Group should explore the idea of
                        establishing better information exchange internationally on transfers of
                        materials, equipment, or technology. The Ad Hoc Group’s study should be
                        forwarded by August 12, 1974 for the President’s consideration.</p>

                    <p>The President has reviewed the results of the <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1"
                            >NSSM</gloss> 195 study and subsequent Verification Panel work. On the
                        question of limitations on underground nuclear tests, he has decided that an
                        agreement with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> to a threshold ban
                        is acceptable in principle. Such an agreement should meet the following
                        conditions:</p>
                    <p>—The threshold test ban should enter into force no earlier than January 1,
                        1976.</p>
                    <p>—<gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> may be allowed only if information
                        adequate for proper verification is furnished by the Soviets. In any event,
                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> must be covered by the same
                        threshold as nuclear weapons tests.</p>
                    <p>—The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> should oppose the Soviet proposal
                        concerning a quota between an upper and lower threshold.</p>
                    <p>—The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> can accept a threshold based on
                        yield if adequate geological information is provided by the Soviets and
                        their weapons testing is restricted to specific test sites. The <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> position is that the threshold must be at
                        least 100 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>—With respect to explosions above the threshold, the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> can accept a provision allowing for no more than two

                    <p>The President has directed that the Atomic Energy Commission and the
                        Department of Defense develop a nuclear weapons testing program which would
                        complete all essential testing above a 100 <gloss target="#t_KT_1"
                            >KT</gloss> threshold by January 1, 1976. This program should be

                        important and complex problem is limiting the arms race. He noted that a
                        “sharp discussion” has arisen on this question, citing “those circles” in
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and its allies which oppose
                        relaxation of tensions. After brief digression denying Soviet responsibility
                        for starting arms race, <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>
                        praised 1972 and 1973 agreements on arms limitations and urged that “we must
                        continue along this path, we must go further.” He said Soviet Union favors
                        mutual agreement to show “maximum restraint” developing weaponry, and
                        agreement on “preventing the creation of newer and newer strategic weapons
                        systems.”</p>
                    <p>5. At this point, <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> stated “we

                        limitation of underground testing of nuclear weapons, including full

                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion of matters unrelated to a test ban.]</p>
                    <pb n="124" facs="0158" xml:id="pg_124"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Fine. The Soviet
                        Union first proposed to you, Mr. President, a complete ban on all
                        underground testing. They proposed a moratorium while we worked out the
                        detailed agreements. They also indicated that if all of the countries did
                        not agree, both sides would be free to withdraw from the agreement. Since it
                        is clear that the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> and France would
                        continue their tests, this was obviously just a maneuver directed primarily
                        at China. Furthermore, there are verification problems with a comprehensive
                        test ban. As a result, we rejected their proposals. The Soviets then
                        proposed a threshold test ban. We reviewed this proposal at the Verification
                        Panel. Several views developed. The threshold test ban would have a useful
                        effect on Soviet programs—it would drive them down to lower yields. It would
                        continue to permit a vigorous <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        underground testing program and would not affect our basic strategic
                        capabilities. It would also maintain the viability of our nuclear weapons
                        laboratories and if the threshold is high enough, it would not have serious
                        verification problems.</p>
                    <p>Let me now go to a review of our progress to date. We have been holding
                        technical talks with the Soviets in Moscow. We have also done studies here
                        and have concluded that an agreement based on yield would be better than one
                        based on seismic signals, although these are related since a yield would
                        have to be translated into a seismic signal for verification purposes. The
                        position which we have generally agreed to is as follows:</p>
                    <p>—A threshold test ban is acceptable in principle.</p>
                    <p>—The ban should enter into effect no earlier than 1 January 1976.</p>
                    <p>—We could accept a yield approach if adequate geological information is
                        available. This has been accepted by the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>—We would want the yield to be at least 100 kilotons and, in fact, we have
                        set it for now at 150 kilotons.</p>
                    <p>—With respect to peaceful nuclear explosions (<gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNEs</gloss>), we would have to be provided adequate information to
                        determine their yield and they would have to be covered by the threshold in
                        any event.</p>
                    <p>—With respect to explosions above the threshold, we could accept the Soviet
                        proposal allowing for two explosions slightly above the threshold each
                        year.</p>
                    <p>The Defense Department and the Atomic Energy Commission have also been
                        directed to produce a program to complete essential testing before January
                        1976.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the position of the Soviet Union, they have not said what
                        threshold level they would accept. They want two levels—a low level, around
                        5–10 kilotons, below which tests would be free and then a sandwich between
                        this level and an upper level which has not been defined and a quota in
                        between. They want to set the upper level high enough to include the <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>.</p>
                    <pb n="125" facs="0159" xml:id="pg_125"/>
                    <p>Our position on this has been that a quota is not acceptable. It is not
                        verifiable since they could set off multiple shots. We have said we could
                        accept only one threshold, above which all such shots would be prohibited.
                        On <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>, we can not let them run free since
                        this would eliminate the effects of the agreement. Nor can we accept a very
                        high threshold; if the threshold is as high as 500 kilotons, with an
                        uncertainty factor of 1½–2, the threshold becomes essentially
                        meaningless.</p>
                    <p>So where we stand is this. We have agreed in principle to aim for a threshold
                        test ban. We have not agreed on a threshold, nor have we solved the problem
                        of quotas or <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>. What this means, Mr.
                        President, is that you will not have nothing to talk about at the summit.

                    <p>There also remain some other technical issues, such as proof testing, but I

                    <p>Given all this, probably about the best we can expect at the summit would be
                        an agreement in principle. Perhaps we could also agree on the time it would
                        go into effect, the threshold level, and one or two other provisions,
                        leaving all of the seismic details and other technical matters to be worked

                    <p>In summary, Mr. President, in Moscow you will need to solve the problems

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: What is the
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> proposal?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: He has proposed
                        a complete ban on all testing. <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1"
                            >Kennedy</persName> went to Russia and came back with the <persName

                        about 15 minutes. It is obvious that this is a move directed purely at
                        China. We rejected this at your instructions.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Not to mention
                        Egypt!</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: They won’t have
                        nuclear weapons for six years!</p>
                    <p>Dr. Ikle: This is a resolution which has been around for about a year. It
                        would have us start out with a moratorium on all further testing.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Well I hope we
                        reject it—a moratorium is clearly one sided. One thing this does is indicate
                        the direction of Congress on issues like this. We have to remember that we
                        do not operate in a vacuum here.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: There are several
                        outstanding weapons programs. [<hi rend="italic">4 lines not
                            declassified</hi>] We will need time to test these ongoing programs. We
                        will also need a yield limit high enough to permit testing. We need to
                        protect our options if new programs are needed.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: Three of the
                        warheads could be completed by 1 July 1976. This was the <gloss

                        position—that we start <pb n="126" facs="0160" xml:id="pg_126"/>any
                        agreement not before 1 July 1976. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not
                            declassified</hi>] But these are marginal items, depending upon the
                        program you feel is needed.</p>
                    <p>I would like to make the point, however, that as a general proposition, if
                        you look only at military considerations, ignoring basic foreign policy
                        considerations, the threshold test ban is more advantageous to the Soviet
                        Union than the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> First, the Soviet Union
                        has considerable throw weight to be exploited. We have utilized our
                        technology—accuracies and yield-to-weight ratios—and we have kept down our
                        throw weight. This technology option is closed by a threshold test ban.
                        Second, the Soviet Union has recently concentrated on high yields, and we
                        haven’t. Threshold test ban would permit the Soviets to operate in an area
                        we have been exploiting, but prohibit us operating in the area they have
                        been exploiting. Again, these are purely military considerations. But in
                        these terms, the test ban would be advantageous to the Soviet Union. Of
                        course, this treaty is on the face of it absolutely equal.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Ikle: One other military consideration is that a threshold test ban would
                        stop Soviet high yields. Without it they could continue to do perhaps even
                        better in high yields. And a foreign policy consideration is that the higher
                        the threshold, the more the advantages of the treaty vanish. It would be
                        perceived as no limit at all.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: I agree with
                            <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Fred</persName>’s point. The difference to
                        us in a threshold between 75 and 150 kilotons is not very great. It may be
                        advantageous to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to have a lower
                        rather than higher threshold.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: There is another
                        consideration here—one which goes back to our 1972 agreements. We talk about
                        what we can do and what they can do and so forth. Certainly, we have the
                        potential to do things, but there are political constraints on us, and they
                        have none. We have to remember that we have a constant running battle with
                        Congress. On the <gloss target="#t_ABM_1">ABM</gloss>, we won by only one
                        vote. For example, people talk about what we gave up in the previous
                        agreement. But we never would have done anything more, and they might
                        have.</p>
                    <p>I never thought that a test ban was any damn good. I didn’t like the first
                        one, nor do I like this one. I see the test ban pandering to the view that
                        stopping testing will lead to a safer world. But we have to be realistic,
                        and the world and the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> public believe
                        the test ban is a great goal worth achieving in itself. In that context, if
                        we can do something with no appearance of any inequality, maybe we can
                        negotiate an agreement. We have to remember that they will do whatever is
                        allowed, but we will not do as much as we are allowed. Restraints which we
                        can negotiate are restraints on them which they would not do themselves. The
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> will restrain itself, but the
                        Soviet Union has no such restraints built in. From a pragmatic standpoint,
                        we should realize that this is going to take quite a bit of doing.</p>
                    <p>Suppose in 2½ years, a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> President takes a
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> view. That is, he wants
                        to satisfy the establishment, and by that I mean the eastern <pb n="127"
                            facs="0161" xml:id="pg_127"/>establishment view. As <persName
                            corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName> put it, he would be for the
                        right things for the wrong reasons. But in the years ahead the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> will have a tendency to restrain itself
                        and the Soviet Union will not.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. President, I
                        do not believe you can accept the proposition that you are going ahead on
                        political interest against the military interests of the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                    </p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: No, I agree. What I
                        am saying is that when we have fought and bled to death for <gloss
                            target="#t_ABM_1">ABM</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_B1_1">B–1</gloss>,
                        Trident, and so forth, and only barely gotten these, if we can limit the
                        Soviets in the future, when we may have Administrations which will not fight
                        for these programs, we will have helped the country.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I think it is
                        important that we analyze what we mean by Soviet military advantage. We have
                        an advantage currently in yield-to-weight ratios, and a threshold test ban
                        would constrain yield-to-weight ratios. It would be a brake on transforming
                        a throw weight advantage to a yield advantage for the Soviets. The threshold
                        test ban would freeze them at their present level of technology, or force
                        them to yield lower yields. Both of these would benefit the <gloss

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: There is another
                        point. First, nothing can help us that does not provide for equivalence. But
                        anything that provides for equivalence is pragmatically to our advantage.
                        This is your point that you continually make about the [19] 72 agreements.
                        We agreed not to do things we were not going to do anyway. We can’t tell the
                        world this, but here we must make decisions on a pragmatic basis and try for
                        agreements on the basis of equality.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: With respect to the
                        time the agreement goes into effect, it should be set in such a way that we
                        will have reasonable assurance that we can test the new weapons we need.
                        Second, we should remember the Soviet response on the LTB. They surged
                        forward with an accelerated program to finish all their testing before it
                        went into effect. I think we should carefully examine their test sites to
                        determine whether they are accelerating now. Bill, do you have anything on
                        this?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: They have some tests they
                        are preparing for, including one which could be an air test, but we think
                        not. We see no evidence of acceleration.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: I would think you
                        need a careful study of that. We need assurances that we have the hedges
                        available to update systems in terms of yield and throw weight if the
                        Soviets show no restraint in the future.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: We could accelerate
                        our testing programs also.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: And we plan to
                        do so. The <gloss target="#t_AEC_1">AEC</gloss> will emphasize yields
                        greater than the threshold. With respect to the timing the <pb n="128"
                            facs="0162" xml:id="pg_128"/>
                        <gloss target="#t_AEC_1">AEC</gloss> and Defense Department say July 1, the
                            <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> says January 1. Second, with
                        respect to verification, we will need a continuing exchange between
                        technical people so the Administration has confidence we can say roughly
                        what yield the Soviets have tested. Third, with respect to a quota greater
                        than the threshold, the <gloss target="#t_AEC_1">AEC</gloss> and Defense
                        Department position is somewhat more liberal than the positions posed by
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry</persName>. We would feel that is not
                        disadvantageous if a small quota, for example, one per year for three years,
                        were permitted above the threshold. [<hi rend="italic">1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] Once again, though, improvement of weapons technology
                        is no longer the pacing item in weapons development. Even if we stopped
                        testing entirely, we would not be severly damaged. We would have been in the
                        50s but not now. The important measures are accuracy and <gloss
                            target="#t_RV_1">RV</gloss> development.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RKW_1">Rush</persName>: How effectively can you go
                        ahead on our reentry vehicle development without testing?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: You may have
                        to use other than the optimal weapons, and not be able to minimize the throw
                        weight needed. But that’s the nature of arms agreements—that you are limited
                        to something other than the optimal.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Again, if we are
                        ahead now the test ban would freeze our advantage.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: But our
                        advantage is in lower yields—an area still open to the Soviets for further
                        work.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: In answer to Ken, we
                        can continue to do work on the yields and accuracy.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I would like to
                        clarify one thing. The Soviet proposal is for a quota below the
                        threshold—it’s a sandwich approach—a quota between the lower and upper
                        threshold. This would constrain the number of tests allowed below the
                        threshold, and would be a constraint on us. This is the approach we
                        rejected.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t
                        understand.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Yes, I did not
                        understand that either.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, that
                        proposition is for a quota below the threshold. This we have said would be
                        unacceptable.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: It would be
                        one-sided because it’s not verifiable. We would be constrained but they
                        wouldn’t.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: With respect to
                        a quota above the threshold, it would make the agreement essentially
                        meaningless, at least for the period in which the quota was permitted.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Ikle: Another problem with the two threshold Soviet approach is that
                        their lower threshold would be around 5 kilotons [<hi rend="italic">1 line

                        dealings with India.</p>
                    <p>Fundamentally, we need to consider (a) whether our basic policy in opposition
                        to the spread of nuclear weapons remains a feasible as well as desirable

                    <p>The nonproliferation of nuclear weapons has been a consistent and important
                        element of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy for the entire
                        nuclear era. Our strong resolve in support of this objective has been
                        predicated on the belief <pb n="130" facs="0164" xml:id="pg_130"/>that an
                        unrestrained spread of nuclear weapons would be detrimental to <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> security and international stability.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Risk of War</hi>. The risk of nuclear war will tend to be
                        increased if additional states acquire independent nuclear forces. More
                        nuclear weapons states, each relating differently to the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and each other, would have to be deterred,
                        in crisis periods an effective <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        deterrent posture would be more difficult to achieve, and the maintenance of
                        a stable <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet nuclear relationship
                        would be complicated. There would be a greater danger that local conflicts
                        could escalate into nuclear wars and the statistical probability of nuclear
                        war being started by accident, miscalculation, unauthorized use, or an
                        irresponsible leader would increase. “Selective” proliferation to allies
                        could not be relied upon to reduce these or other problems associated with
                        nuclear diffusion.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Political Dangers</hi>. Nuclear weapons could give nations
                        a real or perceived sense of greater power and independence in the foreign
                        policy field, thus complicating international diplomacy. This could result
                        in an even sharper loss of American influence in the world, and, more
                        seriously, could lead to threats to our security or economic interests.
                        Nuclear arms control would become more difficult to achieve, both because
                        present <gloss target="#t_NWS_1">NWS</gloss> would desire additional
                        strategic options and because a greater number of states would have to agree
                        to arms limitations.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Theft and Sabotage Problems</hi>. Apart from the question
                        of deliberate decisions by governments to mount weapons programs is the
                        possibility of theft of nuclear material by radical organizations,
                        revolutionary groups, or crime syndicates, and the prospect of deliberate
                        sabotage. As the commercial nuclear power industry expands and spreads
                        throughout the world, the opportunities for such actions will increase.
                        These scenarios can pose a serious threat to <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> security by raising international tensions, endangering

                    <p>The main elements of our non-proliferation policy are that: (1) non-nuclear
                        weapons states (<gloss target="#t_NNWS_1">NNWS</gloss>) should forswear the
                        acquisition of nuclear explosives; (2) nuclear weapons states (<gloss
                            target="#t_NWS_1">NWS</gloss>) should not help non-weapons states obtain
                        such explosives; (3) the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> will cooperate
                        in the peaceful application of nuclear energy; (4) there should be
                        safeguards as widely applicable as possible to assure that nuclear material
                        from civilian nuclear programs is not diverted by <gloss target="#t_NNWS_1"
                            >NNWS</gloss> to any nuclear <pb n="131" facs="0165" xml:id="pg_131"
                        />explosives; and (4) nuclear exports to <gloss target="#t_NNWS_1"
                            >NNWS</gloss> must be subject to such safeguards.</p>
                    <p>To accomplish these goals, we have sought to gain widespread adherence to the
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> by <gloss target="#t_NWS_1"
                            >NWS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_NNWS_1">NNWS</gloss> alike. At
                        present, there are 83 parties to the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>
                        and 23 signatories, with several important nations (notably Japan, Italy,
                        and the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>) reasonably likely to become
                        parties within a year.<note n="5" xml:id="d57fn5">Italian ratification is
                            delayed due to domestic politics; the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"

                            ratification has become less certain as a result of the Indian test.

                        signatories include nearly all states with an operative nuclear industry and
                        nearly all present suppliers in this field, there are some important
                        exceptions. France (which has declared that it would act as if it were a
                        party) and the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> (which does not yet make
                        nuclear power reactors and may well refrain from activity contributing to

                            >NNWS</gloss> (including Israel, Argentina, Brazil, and Pakistan) are
                        not likely to become <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> parties;
                        similarly, a few significant signatories (such as Egypt) are unlikely to
                        ratify in the foreseeable future.</p>
                    <p>Recognizing that a number of significant <gloss target="#t_NNWS_1"
                            >NNWS</gloss> are likely to refuse to join the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                            >NPT</gloss> for an indeterminate period, the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> has sought to reduce nuclear weapons incentives and
                        capabilities through other policies encompassing: (1) controls and
                        safeguards over exported nuclear material and equipment; (2) efforts to
                        develop common export policies among the major commercial suppliers of
                        nuclear material and facilities; and (3) policies aimed at reducing the
                        possibility that <gloss target="#t_NNWS_1">NNWS</gloss> will decide to
                        develop nuclear devices for peaceful purposes. Alliances, mutual defense
                        policies, security assurances, and forward deployment of <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> forces also have an important potential
                        bearing on the willingness of states to forego acquisition of independent
                        nuclear weapons. Although <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy
                        decisions in these areas involve other important considerations beyond the
                        scope of this report, any modifications in our present positions should take
                        into account their nonproliferation implications.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Feasibility of Non-Proliferation Policies.</p>
                    <p>Technical developments and political trends will increase both the difficulty
                        and the importance of deterring or retarding further nuclear proliferation
                        during the coming decade.</p>
                    <p>—Nuclear power generation is coming into wider use throughout the world and
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> dominance as a commercial supplier
                        is diminishing. Since the rudimentary principles of weapons design are well
                        known, it will therefore become less difficult for nations to acquire
                        nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <pb n="132" facs="0166" xml:id="pg_132"/>
                    <p>—We are entering a period when political barriers to non-proliferation appear
                        to be weakening. Movements toward a multipolar world could increase the
                        incentives to acquire independent nuclear capabilities, and reliance on the
                        security guarantees of others seems decreasingly attractive to many
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>—Finally, as a result of the Indian nuclear test, other <gloss
                            target="#t_NNWS_1">NNWS</gloss> will inevitably consider becoming
                        nuclear weapons states. These countries will be influenced by the reactions
                        of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, other nuclear powers, major
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> proponents, and potential nuclear
                        weapons states. The consequences, particularly in the event of a low-key
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> response, could be a sequential or
                        “chain reaction” with perhaps as many as ten additional states acquiring
                        some nuclear weapons capability or conducting “peaceful” nuclear
                        explosions.</p>
                    <p>This picture of proliferation patterns may imply that we have no choice but
                        to resign ourselves to the inevitability of further nuclear weapons spread
                        and to begin to shape the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> security
                        policies to a world environment of relatively large numbers of independent
                        nuclear powers. But upon closer examination, a strong case can be made that
                            <hi rend="italic">policies aimed at deterring further proliferation can
                            still be effectively pursued.</hi> A number of factors support this

                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Not all key <gloss target="#t_NNWS_1">NNWS</gloss> have
                            the necessary capabilities needed to produce nuclear

                        able to acquire in the near-term the necessary capacity to do so. With the
                        exception of Israel, which may already have developed weapons, other likely
                        proliferators appear to be 3–10 years away from an initial test. Countries

                    <p>As elaborated below, a variety of positive and negative approaches are
                        available to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> in support of a
                        nonproliferation policy. The problem is one of reviewing and building upon
                        the many actions already underway and planned—not one of constructing an
                        entirely new policy—and exploring the degree to which these actions should
                        be altered, expanded, or extended.</p>
                    <p>The recommendations have taken account of the fact that some
                        anti-proliferation approaches could be non-productive and that pressure
                        tactics or excessively discriminatory policies could stimulate the
                        probability of proliferation—by driving recipient nations away from

                        arrangements with suppliers that may have less strict controls or possibly

                        have also considered the possibility of conflicts between our

                        even parties to the Treaty and strong supporters such as Canada might lose
                        interest, and the common interest which we have with the Soviets in this

                    <p>The Indian nuclear explosion raises a number of new problems for our

                    <p>—how to minimize the risk that others (such as Israel, Argentina and Brazil)
                        will follow the Indian “<gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>” route;</p>
                    <p>—how to minimize the risk that India will make nuclear explosives or the

                    <p>—how to minimize the risk that India, as a potential exporter of nuclear
                        materials and equipment, will undercut international nuclear export control
                        efforts designed to require safeguards and meet other nonproliferation
                        concerns;</p>
                    <p>—how to minimize the adverse impact of the Indian explosion on efforts to

                            >NPT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>In dealing with India it is recognized that strong measures directed against
                        the Indian nuclear program might create resentment on the part of the
                        Indians which could harm nonproliferation efforts by making more difficult
                        our efforts to deter the Indians from expanding their nuclear explosives
                        program and to induce them to adopt a safeguarded nuclear export position.
                        On the other hand, acceptance of the Indian decision or condoning its
                        “peaceful uses” rationale could have the effect of encouraging other nations
                        to follow the Indian route.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommended Actions</p>
                    <p>1. Persuade other nuclear suppliers to obtain from India the type of
                        assurance with respect to non-use of their nuclear exports in any nuclear
                        explosive that we have requested India to furnish before our next shipment
                        of enriched uranium for the Tarapur reactors (this is arguably an obligation
                        for <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> parties) and have the Zangger
                        (nuclear exporters’) Committee consider this question further.</p>
                    <p>2. Consult with Canada on following urgent matters:</p>
                    <p>a) Our respective approaches to future nuclear cooperation with India;</p>
                    <p>b) need to tighten legal and technical safeguards on Canadian-supplied
                        Rajasthan reactors;</p>
                    <pb n="139" facs="0173" xml:id="pg_139"/>
                    <p>c) handling of Argentine purchase of <gloss target="#t_CANDU_1">CANDU</gloss>
                        reactor, (including safeguards effectiveness), and how to deal with <gloss

                    <p>3. Head off Pakistani acquisition of chemical reprocessing plant, which they

                        independent ability to make nuclear explosives.</p>
                    <p>a) Consult with Japan, Belgium, <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>, France
                        and other potential suppliers.</p>
                    <p>b) Seek Zangger (nuclear exporters’) Committee consensus on avoiding
                        assistance and seek to arrange reprocessing Pakistani fuel abroad.</p>
                    <p>4. Develop recommendations for discussions with India and Pakistan for use by
                        Secretary of State during planned late summer visit with view towards:</p>
                    <p>a) securing more binding assurances from India on indigenous nuclear
                        program;</p>
                    <p>b) securing Indian agreement to safeguard nuclear exports and to adopt
                        appropriate <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> assistance policy (see D
                        below);</p>
                    <p>c) obtaining Pakistani assurance not to use supplied or derived nuclear
                        material for any nuclear explosive.</p>
                    <p>5. Discuss with Soviets the undesirability of either supplying India with
                        long-range bombers (of which we are the only two sources of supply).<note

                    </p>
                    <p>6. Consider specific security assurances for Pakistan, either unilaterally

                        Some declaration along these lines could be considered independently of a

                        that would undercut international safeguard efforts and other

                        dramatizes the risks of having unsafeguarded indigenous facilities. With
                        wider <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> adherence by <pb n="140"
                            facs="0174" xml:id="pg_140"/>suppliers and recipients, the number of
                        unsafeguarded facilities can be held to a minimum. But efforts must continue
                        to be made outside the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> framework to
                        diminish the ability of key <gloss target="#t_NNWS_1">NNWS</gloss> to

                        program without rigorous, thorough and positive safeguards. A vigorous
                        cooperative program with other nations in the nuclear field can (unless our
                        failure to enforce our agreements gives a contrary signal) help ensure that
                        we will exert influence over foreign programs, not only through proper
                        safeguards but also through leverage derived from dependence on <gloss

                        of much nuclear technology. Nevertheless, the costs of implementing <gloss

                        with the goal of reviewing our respective export policies and exploring
                        whether France, which has not systematically applied safeguards to its

                        exports and exports that would help India or others develop an advanced
                        nuclear delivery capability. Of particular importance is the need to ensure
                        that France will not undercut efforts to contain the Indian program and deal

                        policy with respect to future availability and supply of uranium enrichment
                        services, or decisions on any major changes in such policy.</p>
                    <p>This review should take into consideration the desirability, from a
                        nonproliferation standpoint, of maintaining the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> role as a major supplier. The <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> should continue Energy Coordinating Group consultations
                        with other countries on enrichment supply policies, with a view to ensuring
                        that they serve non-proliferation objectives.</p>
                    <p>Our role as the dominant supplier of enriched uranium for foreign power
                        reactors is diminishing with the advent of new enriching plants overseas,
                        together with the exhaustion of excess capacity at our existing plants.
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> private industry is now seriously
                        considering construction of an additional enrichment plant with 9,000,000
                        SWU capacity and a decision is expected in the near future. (A review of the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> enrichment services situation has
                        been requested by the House Appropriations Committee.)</p>
                    <p>Our position as a commercially attractive supplier of enrichment services
                        gives us leverage to obtain appropriate safeguards and guaran<pb n="142"
                            facs="0176" xml:id="pg_142"/>tees on our exports, and to make dependence
                        on us for periodic refueling of the nuclear power plants a factor that helps
                        enforce such undertakings. Loss of this position could drive customers to
                        deal with other suppliers who impose less rigorous conditions, or who sell
                            <gloss target="#t_CANDU_1">CANDU</gloss> type reactors, which are more
                        difficult to safeguard, and, by eliminating dependence on enriched uranium
                        supply, provide less leverage to prevent the acquisition of unregulated
                        weapons grade material.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Rationale</p>
                    <p>It is inherently impossible to develop a <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        that does not at the same time contribute to the developer’s nuclear weapons

                            >NPT</gloss> give up their option to do so. Thus, any action that tends
                        to encourage or give international blessing to a <gloss target="#t_NNWS_1"
                            >NNWS</gloss> in developing its own <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"

                            >NNWS</gloss> who have joined the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>.
                        Moreover, in order to fulfill our obligations under the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> not to give such assistance, it is
                        essential that, in the case of non-<gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>
                        parties, we reinforce restrictions against the use of our nuclear exports in
                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>. To obtain such assurances we
                        should be prepared to cancel further nuclear shipments to the country
                        involved if it refuses our request.</p>
                    <p>Neither the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> nor the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> has fulfilled the expectations of <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> parties that we would make nuclear
                        explosives services available to them for peaceful purposes as contemplated
                        in Article V of the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>. Most of the
                        foreign interest to date, which has been preliminary in nature, appears to
                        have been in excavation projects (canals and harbors) which probably present
                        problems under the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>. But regardless of
                        the project, lengthy and detailed feasibility and engineering studies would
                        have to be conducted before any actual explosion services could take
                        place.</p>
                    <p>As noted above, nuclear excavation presents problems of compliance with
                            <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> and may well be precluded by a
                            <gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss> in the absence of a special
                        provision that would constitute a major loophole without comprehensive
                        constraints that would be difficult to negotiate. While we have no plans for
                        nuclear excavation, the Soviets appear to be preparing for a follow-on to
                        their 1971 experiment in preparation for excavation of a Kama-Pechora canal.
                        Their <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> advocates would like to see
                        special exceptions for <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> worked out
                        under either a <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> or a <gloss

                    <p>Complicating factors in dealing with the nonproliferation aspects of <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> are the apparent strength of the Soviet
                        interest in <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> (which <pb n="143"
                            facs="0177" xml:id="pg_143"/>has become evident in the <gloss
                            target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss> negotiations), the apparent interest of
                        the French in providing <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> services (even
                        though their technical readiness to do so is doubtful), and the impetus that
                        the Indian explosion may give to other <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>
                        holdouts who may wish to keep open the option to develop their own <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>. It must be recognized that an offer of
                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> services to such <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> holdouts would not be likely to induce
                        them to forswear this option or join the Treaty, and that few <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> parties appear to be urgently interested
                        in <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> services. However, it would make it
                        harder for them to justify their own indigenous <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> effort.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendations</p>
                    <p>1. Obtain, and urge other <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> parties to
                        obtain, assurances from any non-<gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>
                        countries supplied by <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> parties that they
                        will not use nuclear exports from such <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>
                        parties for any nuclear explosive development, and ensure that safeguards
                        apply to this commitment. We should be prepared to cancel further nuclear
                        shipments to the country involved if it refuses to give such assurances.</p>
                    <p>2. Consult with Soviets on how we both expect to handle the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> Article V problem in the coming year,
                        including possibilities of:</p>
                    <p>a) developing a mechanism for supplying <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        services pursuant to that article;</p>
                    <p>b) openly discussing in an appropriate international forum the radiation and
                            <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> problems associated with nuclear
                        excavation explosions, and the limitations and problems of other <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> applications;</p>
                    <p>c) deferring further excavation experiments pending outcome of <gloss
                            target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss> negotiations and proposed discussion in
                        November of <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> problems;</p>
                    <p>d) arranging, either jointly or separately, to participate in the coming year
                        in a feasibility study of a <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> project
                        (preferably <hi rend="italic">not</hi> an excavation project) in an <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> state to demonstrate our good faith under
                        Article V.</p>
                    <p>3. Examine on an urgent basis the question of whether special “safeguards”
                        can be devised to help give assurance that any <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"

                        are accounted for and will continue to be channeled to peaceful uses, while
                        not encouraging others to follow the Indian route. (A preliminary
                        examination of this possibility is made in Annex III of the report.)</p>
                    <p>4. Consider extending <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> services offer (as

                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>: Mr. President, what is the
                        first subject for discussion today?</p>
                    <p>President: I think <gloss target="#t_ABM_1">ABM</gloss>. We want to make sure
                        that <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName> don’t sign something that is not
                        in our interest.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion concerning <gloss target="#t_ABM_1"
                        >ABMs</gloss>.]</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>: Good, shall we turn to the
                        European Conference?</p>
                    <pb n="145" facs="0179" xml:id="pg_145"/>
                    <p>President: Either that or the threshold test ban. Since the threshold test
                        ban relates to the same general subject we have been discussing maybe we
                        should take it up and then go on to Europe.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>: Good, let’s do it. That
                        question is basically agreed as Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> said. Why do you want to conduct any underground
                        nuclear tests when we have already had so many tests. When will they
                        stop?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: 1985.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>: That long? What we should
                        do is build on what we have achieved. The previous agreements limit
                        strategic arms. The agreement provides that we will not develop cardinally
                        new types of weapons. And suddenly against this background we will tell the
                        people that we want to go ahead with nuclear testing. So reasoning
                        logically, they will be bewildered: we agree to limit strategic arms but
                        want to go ahead on testing—therein lies certain contradictions. People will
                        ask about that. On the one hand we limit and on the other we conduct
                        explosions. And this against the background of the limited test ban treaty,
                        and they will question why are we conducting underground testing. Therefore,
                        if one looks at another aspect of this matter the present situation enables
                        other nations that signed the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> also to
                        test. This is a politically adverse aspect of this question. So we believe
                        we should discuss the entire range in a friendly manner. We agree to move
                        gradually forward step by step. This question if it remains without a
                        solution will draw the attention of the people. That is why we must give
                        earnest thought to the whole matter.</p>
                    <p>President: Regarding the argument the General Secretary raised with regard to
                        the comprehensive test ban, we have heard this before, and also the points
                        he made. While that might be an objective view, nevertheless, we consider it
                        possible to go the step by step approach. That is why we suggested, as you
                        know, a threshold of 100 kilotons. That gets around the problem and answers
                        the verification problem. I think a step by step approach will have very
                        great meaning. It is the testing of major weapons that causes the greatest
                        concern. We believe we should take a step of this magnitude now to see how
                        it works and it is possible we shall make further progress in the future.
                        When I used the number 100 kilotons we are not totally tied to this but in
                        that low magnitude. There are also other issues we have put on the table for
                        discussion. In addition to the threshold magnitude of 100 kilotons you may
                        have some other ideas on this. We feel from the point of view of promoting
                        nonproliferation of nuclear weapons our agreement can be a factor in
                        encouraging others not to test and will show we are indeed fully determined
                        to proceed along the path of détente and disarmament. Whichever way, whether
                        favoring your or our point of view, there is disagreement. Therefore, logic
                        speaks in favor of ending tests altogether <pb n="146" facs="0180"
                            xml:id="pg_146"/>and this will also have a great effect on others to
                        refrain from testing because there is a gradual spread. In suggesting this
                        we are not pursuing self-seeking goals. It is in the interests of both
                        sides.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName>: Mr. President, if we were
                        to endorse publicly that we want to continue nuclear testing it will not
                        convince anyone. We need to reach agreement as we did on the <gloss
                            target="#t_ABM_1">ABMs</gloss> not to expand our effort. We are going to
                        only one area and that is already disarmament limiting one type of weapon,
                        that is disarmament. But we are continuing nuclear testing with the obvious
                        aim of improving nuclear warheads. So what, in short, does a threshold test
                        ban mean that we will be renouncing? We will not be taking the road of
                        disarmament, but will be perfecting weapons. That will be the obvious tenor
                        of the comments. I just heard today that 20 senators had come out in favor
                        of ending tests.</p>
                    <p>(President: 37.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName>: So what do you think is
                        easier? To justify the need for continuing or the need for stopping. We
                        believe it is easier to justify the need to stop. We believe it is very hard
                        to prove the need to continue nuclear testing. We can prove the value of
                        ending tests to the Congress but the very fact that we don’t reach agreement
                        on ending tests will reduce the significance of questions we are also
                        agreeing to. Speaking frankly, everyone will say we are making concessions
                        to your Pentagon and to judge by the statements of your Secretary of Defense
                        this may be seen as some kind of support of the line taken by the Pentagon.
                        That is, to step up military preparations. Whatever way we decide to
                        discuss, in fact, people will agree that it is a severe blow to our general
                        cause. Also of late, there is on the part of the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> a line of general thought—Israel and Egypt for example
                        received reactors—and all big things start with such little things and
                        therefore for us it is very important to find a solution to this issue and
                        to solve it on a long term basis. If we reach a solution this will be
                        welcomed by all people everywhere.</p>
                    <p>President: We discussed this issue in very great depth before I came. It is
                        true some in our Senate favor a comprehensive test ban. At the other end of
                        the spectrum there are equal numbers who favor no ban at all having in mind
                        the problem of verification. We have tried to take a very significant step
                        to restrain both sides by setting a low threshold. Having taken such a step
                        we will get the support of the majority of our Congress. It is true as
                        Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName> has said that we
                        will not be going all the way. I will speak very candidly in terms of the
                        limit to our negotiations. We cannot go to a total test ban and we think the
                        threshold we are suggesting will be considered a very significant step.
                        Obviously, we have a difference of opinion as I indicated in my opening
                        remarks. I do not want to give the impression that I am not giving
                        consideration to the remarks of the General Secretary and his colleagues.
                        But I also do not want to leave any impression that I simply do what the
                        Pentagon wants to do.</p>
                    <pb n="147" facs="0181" xml:id="pg_147"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName>: I don’t have that
                        impression.</p>
                    <p>President: If so, I wouldn’t be here at all. In our system the decision is
                        taken at my level. If there are differences in our system those in our
                        bureaucracy will disagree publicly rather than as in a more responsible
                        government limit their remarks to private meetings. We have surveyed this
                        question very carefully, not only in our <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"
                            >NSC</gloss> but also with the Congress, and I have reached the
                        conclusion that the proposition we have made to you for discussion is the
                        step we can take but we cannot go further. We have prepared our own people
                        for a threshold test ban. We are prepared to discuss the specifics and to
                        negotiate but not for a comprehensive test ban at this time.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName>: But then you will be coming
                        out in favor of continuing nuclear testing.</p>
                    <p>President: No, the fact is that we are coming out in favor of limiting
                        nuclear testing.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName>: Yes, but those who oppose
                        testing and come out in favor of a comprehensive test ban want to see more
                        progress.</p>
                    <p>President: That may seem to be the case.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName>: In fact, they will be right
                        because then we will have to come out in favor or continuing testing. We
                        cannot claim to interpret the internal aspects of the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>; you are the best judge of that. But we
                        feel the broader approach is more correct.</p>
                    <p>President: We recognize that there has been a lively debate over the years on
                        this issue.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName>: There is throughout the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>President: But the point we have in mind is the one the General Secretary
                        recognized. We have got to take these things on a step by step basis. For
                        example, the most progressive point of view would be to ban all nuclear
                        weapons and destroy all of them. Yet neither of us is in a position to go
                        that far at this point. In this field we feel an obligation for our security
                        and also to consider verification. Taking account of public opinion this
                        will still be the biggest step we can have taken in that the threshold will
                        be very low—in the neighborhood of 100 kilotons. That, of course, is a
                        matter for negotiation.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>: While discussing this the
                        question arises: why do we need tests at all. This is the toughest question.
                        It must be taken into account. Under the previous agreement you have tested
                        all you can and we have tested all we can. We favor the non-proliferation
                        treaty and so do you. And yet, nonetheless, we want to go on testing. Why do
                        we leave this loophole? We can vouch for everybody here so let us understand
                        what is the real reason. Who are we acting for? Who are we trying to please
                        by continuing testing? I am perplexed; we are not pleased with continued
                        testing. We are not pleasing the people, but <pb n="148" facs="0182"
                            xml:id="pg_148"/>maybe the top echelon of the Pentagon. So the question
                        does arise why continue testing. I don’t know. Maybe because of a group of
                        senators, maybe because of <persName corresp="#p_JHM_1">Jackson</persName>.
                        But we care ourselves in the interests of our people. In terms of world
                        opinion, if we continue, if our two countries cannot cease testing, this
                        will become a decisive factor in terms of others who wish to continue
                        testing. The step we want would have beneficial influence on the entire
                        international situation. It would favorably affect the French public and
                        opinion in China. Several of them would in this situation be in complete
                        isolation. Otherwise, they say the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> are still testing. Let’s join in
                        and test with them. But this is not much in line with the expression of
                        world opinion today.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName>: Every correspondent will
                        ask did we discuss limiting nuclear testing. What happens when we say we
                        discussed continuing testing? What will you say? It will not be a pleasant
                        burden. I would not wish to carry thus unpleasant task. We want to take
                        another step more beneficial in strengthening the line of cooperation.
                        Otherwise, when we are asked who wanted to continue testing and we have to
                        say it was not the Soviet Union, and in our draft as we suggest it is
                        specifically addressed to others. We merely call on them to accede. If this
                        has no effect, if others do not accede, then in two years we will be free to
                        resume. We would not want to but we must leave ourselves this option. On the
                        other hand, under the arrangements already envisaged which will be extended,
                        neither side will create cardinally new weapons so there will be no need for
                        further testing. I say this not merely out of a desire to attack your
                        position or to talk you into it, but to give you an understanding of our
                        position and to gain an agreement that will improve mutual confidence. We
                        fully accept what some will say about this but it is up to us to find
                        agreements that our views frankly and openly. [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]
                        We can discuss this at greater length but boldly.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We have had a period of
                        exchanging views on this subject, and you are aware of our reasoning why we
                        are not prepared to have a comprehensive test ban. Incidentally, the fact
                        that you pointed out concerning <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> the
                        agreements do not prohibit developing weapons that will require some
                        testing. Thus, we had agreed that we could have a threshold test ban, the
                        one which our experts have been working on for two weeks, which would not
                        exclude a comprehensive test ban in the future if the whole situation with
                        respect to strategic weapons were clarified. We want a threshold test ban at
                        this summit, Mr. President, but there are a number of important issues that
                        require resolution, at least in principle: (1) at what level the threshold
                        should be set; (2) what to do about peaceful nuclear explosions; (3) what to
                        do about exchanging enough data to convert a kiloton threshold into a
                        seismic magnitude; and finally, what to do about Soviet proposals for a
                        quota on the number of tests below the threshold. There are other points but
                            <pb n="149" facs="0183" xml:id="pg_149"/>they can be settled so that we
                        could sign a protocol giving instructions to establish a threshold test ban
                        within a reasonable period. And then the comprehensive test ban could be
                        taken up within the general framework of stopping the arms race in strategic
                        arms when that is achieved.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>: None of the points you
                        mentioned would exist if we banned all tests.</p>
                    <p>President: Except for the real problem which shall remain: until we get the
                        nuclear arms race under control some testing is inevitably going to go
                        forward. I realize that the General Secretary and Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName> have lost none of their very
                        effective advocacy ability and I appreciate their point of view. But we
                        explained our position before we came and what we are trying to do is to
                        negotiate something that is possible now. That is why we suggest a threshold
                        test ban. I know the press will say this is half a loaf but nevertheless it
                        is a step in the right direction, and we look down the road to stopping all
                        tests, when those conditions that require testing are achieved.
                        Incidentally, either one of you (<persName corresp="#p_KAN_1"
                            >Kosygin</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>)
                        would make a very good Senator but I would want you on my side.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName>: I will be on your side if
                        you agree to end testing. No, I will always be on your side.</p>
                    <p>President: Speaking quite candidly, we have an ironic situation as 1976
                        approaches in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> with respect to
                        détente. There are some who are quite critical of the hard line as opposed
                        to the arms control. But others have now changed their minds. It gets down
                        to this. Those who applauded our efforts toward détente successfully over
                        the past two years now for reasons more of a pristine motive would like to
                        see our efforts fail. I would not make any enemies if I were intractable. It
                        is unlikely that I would be criticized too hard. On the other hand, if I
                        take a reasonable position as I intend to do they will say that I am giving
                        away the store. For example, should I agree to a threshold test ban that
                        cannot be verified they will say that clever fellow <persName
                            corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>, he took <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> again. Even today Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> and I are used to tough
                        negotiations but I heard our critics say in 1972 we made a deal with regard
                        to <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> in which we gave away too much at
                        the conference table. I do not raise these points to indicate that my
                        position is based simply on these political figures. I will move in the
                        direction of détente because for the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> it is indispensable for the peace
                        of the world and that is why we want every possible agreement we can make
                        and implement. That is why I am so critical of the members of the Senate who
                        did not produce MFN. For those who do not follow the American scene it may
                        be quite illuminating to read my Naval Academy speech where I said neither
                        of the great powers can think in terms of military power and threats or
                        think that their economies can affect the internal policies of other
                        nations. We are not going to change your <pb n="150" facs="0184"
                            xml:id="pg_150"/>system and you are not going to change ours. The point
                        I want to make is this: I am in a unique position of being able to bring the
                        American public along in support of détente. I can handle our so-called
                        hawks but only one step at a time and I do not want this process to be
                        interrupted, I want it to continue. What we would like to do is go from here
                        to here but not too far in any one step or one meeting. I have considered it
                        and understood the points you have made. I don’t want to be in a position of
                        questioning Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName>’s
                        eloquent comments on limiting the nuclear arms race. We have to get it under
                        control. But we have to do it on an orderly, step-by-step basis. I consider
                        that our position on this particular issue of the threshold test ban will be
                        a very important step not only for America but for world opinion, though it
                        will not satisfy those who always want to go all the way. But it is far
                        better than the unlimited testing of big weapons. This would not give us an
                        advantage or give you an advantage although some military people might
                        disagree on both sides. It is good to have this kind of open conversation.
                        As we look to those golden doors (gesturing to doors at the entrance) we
                        could say that we all want to reach them but we will not make it if we try
                        to do it in one step. We will always find, Mr. General Secretary, various
                        factors in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and in other countries
                        who for differing reasons want to see détente fail. And we on our part do
                        not want to take a step that we have not prepared the support for. We do not
                        seek to go in that direction because we will be looking for repudiation.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>: In this position we
                        approach all aspects for all sides. We have never engaged in politics. We
                        have never tried to be clever no matter what Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_JHM_1">Jackson</persName> might think. We try to conduct
                        ourselves in a forthright and honest manner in every important issue. This
                        compels us to give serious thought to other aspects and to think about the
                        problem from the standpoint of public opinion and the viewpoint of our
                        allies, both yours and ours. There is no reason to speak further about this
                        but I want to say merely that this step would have a strong impact in line
                        with the goals we set in 1972 to achieve a measure of détente and an impact
                        on the world. You have presented arguments in which you say elements must be
                        heeded but you are steering the foreign policy of the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>. We are acting on a long term basis and not
                        on the basis of temporary considerations. This is the point: we will have to
                        think it over and tomorrow return to further discussions. I will consult my
                        Soviets and we will discuss it further and then we will continue discussions
                        tomorrow. Otherwise if we do not take a step the question will arise why
                        does the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> want to have the right to test.
                        All will say it is more in our interest. You are right in saying that if the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> test we will also do so. Science
                        continues to confront us with new developments. Faced by the scientists we
                        can go on testing. There are <pb n="151" facs="0185" xml:id="pg_151"/>those
                        in the Pentagon who would want to but we came to this table not to outwit
                        you. We know we are dealing with a responsible statesman of a great country.
                        In all these remarks I am merely thinking aloud. But logic prompts us to
                        take a step and end testing.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName>: We have to use our head. We
                        have a head on our shoulders. Let us use our head.</p>
                    <p>President: I suggest we ask Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> and Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2"
                            >Gromyko</persName> to take into account our discussion and if they can
                        come up tomorrow and submit something to us because it is a complicated
                        issue. In view of the fact that we have not reached an agreement on the
                        threshold test ban I think it would not be a good idea to sign the <gloss
                            target="#t_ABM_1">ABM</gloss> agreement Tuesday because if we did
                        everyone would speculate that we couldn’t agree on anything else. I suggest
                        instead we sign the long-term economic agreement tomorrow which indicates
                        movement and try to have something more than just <gloss target="#t_ABM_1"

                        meetings in the morning and sign in the afternoon so we can get to the
                        Crimea while it is still light. We could take a helicopter but there are air
                        streams and if it is not light we would have to go by car.</p>
                    <p>President: We would see more of the country that way.</p>

                        minutes to fly.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName>: We should leave about
                        3:00.</p>
                    <p>President: So we will have the long term agreement. I consider it a
                        well-written document, long-term and looking toward more combinations of our
                        economies. The more our relations improve the more they become irreversible
                        and they give our people a stake in progress. I believe this agreement will
                        be well received by the American business community. They of course want to
                        make deals but they also want to make a profit.</p>

                    <p>President: We will have to use our influence to encourage business. The
                        Secretaries of State, Agriculture and Commerce will be so instructed.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>: I do not want to intervene
                        in your internal affairs.</p>
                    <p>President: You want to overthrow us.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>: No, we want to get you
                        elected.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_PNV_1">Podgorny</persName>: Sometimes it is easier to
                        make an effort when you have the power, the more strength you have the more
                        people hear you. That is why we must use every meeting to reach agreements
                        where we can. We cannot set impossible goals, but as we use the means
                        possible then the goals themselves become more possible and that is what we
                        intend as a step in the test ban.</p>

                        minutes. I pointed out yesterday what the issues are that we need to settle.
                        I don’t think it is possible to draft an agreement here.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Not possible. I think it
                        is possible to draft a protocol that we will finish the agreement in 1974,
                        and specifying a certain threshold, and something on peaceful nuclear
                        explosions.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: Specifying a certain

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. So there is some
                        result. 150, for example.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: 150, the threshold.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. 100–150.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: How about an intermediate

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: You can’t accept it?
                        Yesterday it was said by the President, 100.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I overruled him.
                        [Laughter]</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: This is real democracy.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: He thought you would say
                        300.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: How about the testing
                        fields? The two questions I mentioned yesterday.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You have already agreed
                        to specifying the testing fields.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: That is too bureaucratic an
                        approach. The foundation of the agreement should be the capability of each
                        side to identify. On this supposition we are prepared.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If they can work out some
                        conversion table. But then they are almost back to a seismic threshold. For
                        example, if an explosion at a site is considered equivalent to a certain
                        yield, then the reason for it is not so important. Whether it is granite or
                        otherwise.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: First, information about
                        fields—you insist on it?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: This is one difficulty.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But we know where it is
                        anyway.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: The second one, about the
                        ground.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The second we can handle
                        in one of two ways. Whether we get the data on the ground is decisive only
                        if we have to get <pb n="154" facs="0188" xml:id="pg_154"/>the data
                        ourselves. If you agree to a conversion table, we are in a different
                        position.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: If we are going to produce
                        all kinds of tables and annexes to the agreement, these kind of bureaucratic
                        things only make it more difficult. It is not necessary. What is important
                        is that the parties will do everything possible to determine the nature of
                        the tests. This applies to both the test sites and the kind of rock.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. Foreign Minister, on
                        test sites, it is in Article 2 of your own draft.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: Our position is not to
                        identify and write into the agreement specific test sites.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It doesn’t have to be
                        written into the agreement, but we have to know where the test is taking
                        place.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: In other words, we are not
                        in favor of agreeing on that matter or writing it down anywhere. We are in
                        an equal position in this respect.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Are you saying you don’t
                        want to do it here at the summit? Or that you don’t want to do it at all?
                        Are you withdrawing your own article? I always knew <persName

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: I have a question to ask.
                        Does your delegation have any proposal on the specific amounts of
                        information required on the rock? Because our delegation has the impression
                        you are trying to request an unlimited amount of data. An enormous amount of
                        data.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I don’t doubt that. I
                        don’t doubt that every clever bureaucrat writes down what he thinks is
                        desirable and they add them together. But let me sum up: I know what we have
                        asked for. We could get by with your paragraph two which is less specific
                        but has the essential elements. In other words, we withdraw our paragraph
                        three and accept your paragraph two. On information.</p>

                        us. If we agree that there will be no peaceful nuclear explosions until we
                        agree. Except below the threshold.</p>

                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. President, the
                        Foreign Minister and I and some associates met this morning to review where
                        we stand on the threshold test ban. We pointed out it was probably
                        impossible to complete an agreement while we are here, but it would be
                        possible to sign a protocol which in a rather precise way could settle
                        certain details.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the threshold, the United States side proposed 150 kilotons
                        and only a single threshold.</p>
                    <p>With respect to exchange of geological information, the Soviet side pointed
                        out to us that some of our proposals were perhaps excessive in detail, so we
                        accepted the substance of draft paragraphs two and three of the Soviet
                        draft—we would discuss the exact wording, but essentially those
                        paragraphs.</p>
                    <p>With respect to peaceful nuclear explosions, we propose to keep peaceful
                        nuclear explosions outside this threshold agreement, but we agreed there
                        would be no peaceful nuclear explosions until there is a separate protocol
                        on that subject.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the impact of events elsewhere on the agreement, we propose a
                        five-year review clause. The Foreign Minister said this was a matter he has
                        to discuss with his colleagues.</p>
                    <p>And if we reach an agreement on these issues, these could be a basis of a
                        protocol. This is where the discussion was left.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>: You see how easy their work
                        has been, Mr. President. It is obvious that the United States does not
                        accept the proposal for a complete ban on underground nuclear testing.
                        Politically speaking, from the standpoint of public opinion, this means we
                        are continuing the arms race. Again, politically speaking, this means we
                        will be contradicting the statements we are making. But ways do have to be
                        found <pb n="159" facs="0193" xml:id="pg_159"/>to seek out mutually
                        acceptable solutions. Of course the question does arise as to why we cannot
                        reach an understanding on this issue. I fully agree with what the President
                        said yesterday: Neither of us needs an agreement in which one side can be
                        put in the drawer and eaten up by moths. We need documents that will be
                        really effective and that people feel are really effective. So neither of us
                        can ever be accused of saying one thing and acting in another way.</p>
                    <p>The very fact that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> says
                        it is not possible to reach an agreement does arouse certain doubts. Are we
                        cutting ourselves off from a solution of these questions forever? We could,
                        of course, discuss the questions of quotas or ceilings, but to be told there
                        is no possibility whatsoever of an agreement does cause certain doubts.
                        Because the two days of talks we had with the President instilled confidence
                        in my mind that we should work to an agreement.</p>
                    <p>Just before this meeting we had a brief exchange of views on the substance of
                        the exchanges between Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                        and Comrade <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>. What we feel
                        can be done in the interests of the present, and future as well, is to
                        conclude an agreement.</p>
                    <p>We are fully aware of the tasks you want to solve. In the interests of
                        preserving friendly relations and in the interest of further advances toward
                        limitation of strategic arms, we would be prepared to accept a ceiling of
                        150. . . .</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: Kilotons.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>: . . . kilotons, which does
                        represent a big concession on our part. And it means we are in fact meeting
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> proposal. The lower threshold is
                        immaterial. Do you agree with that?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>: Which, as I say, means we
                        are fully meeting the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> proposal. But
                        what we must give thought to, Mr. President, Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, is how we present this
                        agreement. And we should also be clear in our minds how we want to continue
                        to act to halt the arms race.</p>
                    <p>I would suggest we go about it this way: we cast aside all second-rate
                        matters, details about water and sand, but include a clause in the agreement
                        roughly that the two sides have undertaken to continue within a certain time
                        limit to find a solution to the question of a complete ban on nuclear tests.
                        If we do that, everyone will understand this interim agreement will continue
                        for some time while we continue efforts to find a comprehensive ban. Then
                        people will understand. They will understand it is not possible yet to
                        achieve a comprehensive ban but both will continue active efforts and this
                        will continue in effect until that.</p>
                    <p>Then I would suggest we do not include any specific quotas in the agreement
                        but inscribe a clause that within an agreed period of time <pb n="160"
                            facs="0194" xml:id="pg_160"/>the two sides will conduct a minimum of
                        tests. You will be free to conduct 150-kiloton testing but with a clause
                        indicating a minimal number of tests. We will be indicating the trend of the
                        agreement. And a clause on continuing efforts.</p>
                    <p>That will be the kind of agreement we need. It will show the public we are
                        continuing détente. I think an agreement of that kind can be worked out
                        quickly.</p>
                    <p>I have another question, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName>: Why should we not be permitted to conduct
                        peaceful nuclear tests? We agree they should be left outside this agreement.
                        What we are suggesting is, in the event of any peaceful explosions, we will
                        agree to notify the American side and invite observers.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: And vice-versa.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>: So in the event, therefore,
                        of any peaceful explosions, we would invite your observers to attend
                        there.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I have a few candidates
                        whom I would like to send to the test site. [Laughter]</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>: We wouldn’t place them
                        right on top of the explosion! But if we do any such explosions, it would be
                        to unite two rivers or shift water somewhere, something like that. We have
                        areas, for example, where we have very substantial deposits of copper, and
                        it could become profitable to do that with a nuclear explosion, and we would
                        invite your observers.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: First, let me put the matter
                        in context, the reason we proceeded to spend so much time to work out a test
                        ban of this nature. When Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> returned from Moscow in March, he indicated that
                        our friends on the other side had proposed this as an approach to a complete
                        test ban. As far as the details are concerned, I see that the general
                        principles the General Secretary has outlined are ones that we agree upon.
                        The reservation I have here is with respect to the time limit. So we seem to
                        have a meeting of the minds. I would like to have Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> indicate the points he sees we
                        agree on and the points we would like to have the experts work on.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. President, I think
                        the General Secretary made a very constructive proposal. We agree on the
                        threshold.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Of 150.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Of 150 kilotons, and we
                        can agree to this formulation, I believe, that both sides will conduct the
                        minimum necessary.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: “each side agrees . . .”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We would have to
                        formulate it but the principle is acceptable. I think also, Mr. President,
                        that the approach of the General Secretary to peaceful nuclear explosions
                        offers an approach to a solution, and is acceptable in principle, but we
                        would have to be more <pb n="161" facs="0195" xml:id="pg_161"/>precise in
                        how it works out. We don’t have to do it in this room. I believe the
                        principle of the General Secretary’s proposal is consistent with your
                        instructions.</p>
                    <p>We can also accept stating the objective of working toward a comprehensive
                        test ban.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>: Something to the effect
                        that the sides agreed to continue talks with a view to achieving a complete
                        test ban.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That we can accept. What
                        we cannot accept is saying that a comprehensive test ban must be
                        accomplished in a certain time period.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>: Let us at least say
                        something about the time period for doing it: “To seek to achieve within
                        four years, five years.” Let me suggest we write some words like: “The sides
                        agreed to continue a discussion aimed at finding a solution.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName>: Without a time limit.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>: I think that would be well
                        received.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: That would be better than
                        putting an unrealistic clause saying we will do it by a certain date. That
                        means that between the two sides it has been discussed—which is true
                        directly—and we will continue our best efforts to reach a comprehensive test
                        ban. If you say, for example, a time of five years from now, it may indicate
                        you may reach a test ban in that time but also means we would delay it until
                        then. So saying we will make our best efforts is a better principle.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>: So you see we can reach
                        such an agreement, and that is the substance of an agreement.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Good.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: And on exchange of
                        information, we will use your two paragraphs.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>: Are you prepared to reach
                        such an agreement? Not a protocol, but an agreement?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName>: If we have reached an
                        agreement, we should decide it by an agreement.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>: And we will be indicating
                        the exact test sites. These will be in specified areas.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: These will certainly be
                        the substance of an agreement. The question is whether we can finish all the
                        protocols in time for signature on Tuesday.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>: What details do you
                        mean?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_PNV_1">Podgorny</persName>: Your experts who have been
                        working on it are still here; ours are here. The main thing is to agree on
                        the principles.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName>: Mr. President, we would
                        think it would be in your best interest and ours to have an agreement at
                        this time. It would give you a very strong position in public opinion. So we
                        should do it in two days.</p>
                    <pb n="162" facs="0196" xml:id="pg_162"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: We shouldn’t put an
                        unrealistic deadline on drafting. But we could put diplomatic experts on
                        doing the principles now.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What we could do, Mr.
                        President, is: Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName>,
                        who headed our delegation, could work with the Soviet experts this
                        afternoon. If they can agree on all the protocols, we could sign the
                        principles.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName>: That could be worse, just
                        signing principles. Because your experts have been working about a month
                        together. If we hand these principles down to them, I feel sure they could
                        work out the details very quickly. Then we could have a well-balanced
                        document.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. President, I think,
                        if you agree, you could instruct your experts to meet with theirs. We don’t
                        have to discuss it abstractly. They have two drafts; we could see how far
                        they can get.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName>: They should.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Then if there is a
                        deadlock, it can be brought to you and the General Secretary. So we will
                        keep the Ambassador here [instead of going to Oreanda], if you agree, Mr.
                        President, and they can report to us tomorrow. And you can make a decision
                        together with the General Secretary whether it is ready for the whole thing
                        or just a general statement.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>: Documents of this kind are
                        always elaborated on the basis of decisions at the highest level, but
                        experts always think up 200 problems. So they have to be instructed to stick
                        strictly to the principles we agreed.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: I agree.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_PNV_1">Podgorny</persName>: Let the experts draw up
                        the agreement based on these principles.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: It is important that there be
                        no misunderstanding.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>: Agreed.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: Well, I think we can start.
                        No introductory words are needed, apart from the fact that we have to start
                        our work. Which question shall we start with? After this question, I make a
                        suggestion: I suggest we discuss underground tests.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: If it is possible.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <pb n="164" facs="0198" xml:id="pg_164"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: Suppose we formulate one
                        point in this way: It concerns peaceful tests. It is not a precise text but
                        something like this: “The sides declare they will employ their efforts so as
                        in the nearest possible time to reach agreement on the question of peaceful
                        nuclear underground tests, explosions.” I think such an obligation, such a
                        commitment, would be enough. It wouldn’t look like a formal condition. So as
                        the real agreement comes into force on the other side, it would be strong
                        enough so the two powers will turn this obligation into an agreement,
                        especially taking into consideration the fact that the period is enough,
                        even if you take the beginning of 1976. I cannot imagine we can’t get
                        agreement in a year and a half. Naturally, there may be obstacles that may
                        stand in the way. For the reasons I explained on the plane, I cannot be bold
                        in that connection. I hope you understand us.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand you, Mr.
                        Foreign Minister. My difficulty is agreeing with you, not understanding you.
                        As a practical matter, we cannot implement this agreement until the loophole
                        of peaceful nuclear explosions is closed. We can’t be in a position where we
                        have permitted you to conduct tests above the threshold in the guise of
                        peaceful nuclear explosions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: Your argument is clear, but
                        we consider there are no grounds for doubts, for fears. I want to give you
                        two arguments. About one we already talked. We are ready to consider in a
                        favorable direction the possibility of exchange of observers. We are ready.
                        Now, second: suppose that in the opinion of one of the sides there are
                        grounds for doubts about the actions of the other, we have a special article
                        which guarantees the fundamental interests of the security of the state. A
                        state can withdraw from the agreement. We don’t think any of the sides would
                        put itself into the situation where it would give grounds to the suspicion
                        of the other side. I have already explained this on the plane. I think it is
                        sufficient.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand your point;
                        I think we understand each other’s point. Why won’t we say something like:
                        [reads] “The other provisions of this Treaty do not extend to underground
                        explosions carried out by the parties for peaceful purposes. These shall be
                        governed by an agreement to be negotiated and concluded by the parties
                        before the date specified in Article I.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: All right, it is clear. But
                        I put the question to you: If it happens by one or another reason that it is
                        delayed with regard to peaceful tests, and if more than one side does it,
                        say, the two sides will blame each other for the delay in the agreement, the
                        Soviet Union is in a position where it is prohibited to use peaceful nuclear
                        tests. And there will be these reproaches. Do you understand my point?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand. When the
                        Foreign Minister and I disagree, it is not because we don’t understand each
                        other; it is because we understand each other only too well.</p>
                    <pb n="165" facs="0199" xml:id="pg_165"/>
                    <p>Let me ask: If there is no agreement on peaceful nuclear explosions, should
                        we not implement this treaty?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: We will observe the treaty.
                        But taking into account other aspects would tie our hands with regard to
                        peaceful nuclear explosions, if there is a delay in this agreement.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You are afraid we will
                        stop your peaceful program by either delaying this agreement or dragging our
                        feet on peaceful uses.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: The absence of an agreement
                        on peaceful nuclear explosions should not mean this agreement shouldn’t come
                        into force. We fear your new formula means that if the provision on peaceful
                        nuclear explosions isn’t implemented, there is a delay. You will think it is
                        because of our position and we will think it is because of yours. But we
                        will be left in a position where it will not be possible to carry out
                        peaceful tests. This is the sense of your proposal. If not so, tell us.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: One of two things will
                        happen—you are quite right: Either this agreement won’t go into effect, or
                        the peaceful program will have a moratorium until agreement is reached on
                        peaceful nuclear explosions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: You mean, by the first
                        case, that the treaty won’t come into effect?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We won’t, as a practical
                        matter, be able to ratify unless there is some assurance on peaceful nuclear
                        explosions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: If it is so, then we reject
                        completely this proposal, and on two grounds. Not only the one I already
                        gave, that it would leave us in a situation where we would be without the
                        right to carry out peaceful explosions, but also because the first agreement
                        on underground explosions will not come into force without reaching
                        agreement on peaceful explosions. We couldn’t even agree on one of those
                        grounds, and you give two.</p>
                    <p>[The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> side confers.]</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: My assistants think you
                        don’t need such big explosives. They will be glad to tell you how to run
                        your business.</p>
                    <p>Let me state the problem as I see it. There are two problems: One, is a
                        peaceful nuclear explosion a weapons test? The second is, does it violate
                        the threshold? When a peaceful nuclear explosion is below the threshold, we
                        don’t care if it is a weapons test. When it is above the threshold we do
                        care because it could be used for circumvention of the agreement.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: Let’s not talk about below
                        the threshold; we are talking about above the threshold. Below threshold, we
                        are in agreement; it is free.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Wait a minute. I don’t
                        want you to betray yourself with your usual impetuosity. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MID_1">Morokhov</persName> gave Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> something on below-the-threshold
                        tests—when?—which is acceptable in principle.</p>
                    <pb n="166" facs="0200" xml:id="pg_166"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName>: This morning.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That is acceptable in
                        principle. We would have to modify it but I think we could come to an
                        understanding about this. He gave us two parts—one for above the threshold,
                        and one for below.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: As far as below the
                        threshold is concerned, the question is out because the sides are free in
                        that area.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Not completely, because
                        for military purposes, tests below the threshold, the sites have to be
                        specified. For peaceful purposes, the sites are specified from case to case.
                        According to your own draft. So I consider the draft of Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MID_1">Morokhov</persName> a positive contribution. I think
                        it can solve the problem of peaceful testing below the threshold.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: Just in the area of
                        detection by the sides, but this is quite another matter.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: This is quite another
                        matter. It has to do with verification. National means.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: True, it is another
                        aspect. I think it is useful because we won’t have the geological data and
                        we will need additional data when tests aren’t taking place at the test
                        site.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: You mean national means for
                        verification?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I believe essentially
                        national means, with, however, the requirements contained in your own first
                        paragraph, that is, that you inform us of the time and place and geological
                        information about that place, and for observers as in paragraph three of
                        your draft.</p>
                    <p>You don’t have “geological.” That is one refinement I would add.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: Mr. Secretary of State, we
                        shall return to this text. We don’t think this text will create problems.
                        But we want a clearcut answer to two questions. First, tell us about the
                        agreement we are negotiating right now: will it come into force, if before
                        the indicated time of coming into force it turns out there is no agreement
                        on peaceful explosions? Or will you interconnect these two? You precondition
                        this on the agreement on peaceful nuclear explosions? That is the first
                        question. The second question: assume there is a delay until January, March,
                        July 1976 and by some reasons there is no agreement. Although we think, on
                        our part, we could come to an agreement before. But suppose we come across
                        some difficulty; do you think in this case we have no right to carry out
                        explosions for peaceful purposes? If you base your position on this, we
                        categorically can’t accept this position. Take the Non-Proliferation Treaty,
                        paragraph five. It says that nuclear powers not only by themselves can use
                        it but can assist non-nuclear countries for using it for peaceful purposes.
                        We would like to have an answer to those two questions.</p>
                    <p>When I looked at this text myself, I understood it this way: To the first
                        question, yes, the first agreement enters into force whether there <pb
                            n="167" facs="0201" xml:id="pg_167"/>is agreement on peaceful nuclear
                        explosions or not. As to the second question, it is not clear. We didn’t
                        come to the conclusion that there is an answer in this text.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The two questions are
                        clearly linked. The answer to the second question gives the answer to the
                        first question. Let us say yes to the first question: the agreement goes
                        into force regardless of whether there is agreement to the second. Then we
                        would say a peaceful nuclear explosion below 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1"
                            >kt</gloss> can be conducted according to the Protocol, with the
                        addition given by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MID_1">Morokhov</persName>. With
                        respect to peaceful nuclear explosions above 150 kilotons, there would have
                        to be, in my judgment, a moratorium until agreement was reached. Or there
                        could be a special arrangement for each explosion. I am talking about the
                        above threshold now. There could be a special arrangement.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: [Smiles] Well, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, let us not lose our
                        time speaking about what happens below threshold. Because we agree.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No, there is a problem,
                        Mr. Foreign Minister, because on peaceful explosions, we would not have
                        information about tests off the test site, which would clearly be the case.
                        But it is an easily soluble problem.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: We do not understand your
                        suggestion. Explosions for peaceful purposes are used not in a range but in
                        the mountains, to connect rivers, to make water reservoirs. What do the
                        sites have to do with this?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: On the ranges we will
                        exchange information on test sites, and I understand we are reaching
                        agreement on calibration shots. We would be close to agreement. On other
                        sites, there could be a variation in yield of a factor of two to three, and
                        even below the threshold it could be used for evasion. So even below the
                        threshold there is a problem. But with goodwill and exchange of information
                        it can be settled. Above the threshold it becomes progressively more
                        unmanageable.</p>
                    <p>There is 1 proposal I could make which you will not accept: that each side
                        provides the device to the other that will be exploded. I am serious.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: You know, below the
                        threshold there is no problem.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No, there is a
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: It is artificial. When you
                        have to decide whether an explosion is above or below, there is a problem,
                        but when you say there is a problem you unnecessarily delay it. On an
                        explosion above, we could exchange a very very big volume of information,
                        which would permit us to draw conclusions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The information we
                        exchange refers to test sites; it does not refer to the sites for peaceful
                        explosions. I grant you this problem is more easily solved.</p>
                    <pb n="168" facs="0202" xml:id="pg_168"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: You have a certain amount
                        of truth, that there are no testing sites for peaceful purposes. Then why do
                        you not take into account what we have said: a corresponding conclusion
                        should be negotiated, including an exchange of observers. I said this and
                        you ignore it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No, I know it. But when
                        you say exchange of observers, we have to agree what they will observe.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: [Laughing] Exactly. This is
                        what should be negotiated—talks regarding explosions for peaceful purposes.
                        I can’t take the terms of reference out of my pocket. Perhaps you do. If you
                        do, lay it on the table.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No, I believe it is a
                        soluble problem, with goodwill. But I would like it solved before the
                        agreement goes into effect. Which is nearly two years from now.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: Meaning the agreement on
                        explosions for peaceful purposes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: As I said, there are two
                        possibilities. We could have provisions for peaceful nuclear explosions
                        below the threshold incorporated in this agreement in such a way that your
                        second question would not arise. Because it wouldn’t take much drafting.
                        Removing the question of peaceful explosions below the threshold from this
                        agreement; I think this can be done.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: You are putting conditions.
                        Is it forbidden to carry out peaceful nuclear explosions if there is no
                        agreement on explosions above the threshold?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Explosions above the
                        threshold are excluded until there is an agreement.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KG_1">Korniyenko</persName>: A moratorium.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: You propose to exclude
                        them.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: From now until the treaty
                        goes into effect, there are no restrictions at all. After the treaty goes
                        into effect, there are restrictions on peaceful nuclear explosions until
                        this is agreed.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: It is unacceptable. Tell us
                        on what grounds. Do you want to tie our hands in advance?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We are not trying to tie
                        your hands. If you can have two peaceful nuclear explosions above the
                        threshold, in effect free, how can we possibly explain to our people they
                        are not weapons tests?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: You accept that when we get
                        agreement, we let your people come and you will let ours. We got agreement
                        on that; then you just brush it aside. I don’t understand that.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Suppose we accept Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MID_1">Morokhov</persName>’s suggestion; what is
                        your idea of what would concretely happen with explosions above the <pb
                            n="169" facs="0203" xml:id="pg_169"/>threshold? You say observers. But
                        you don’t say what they do there. I am just taking your second paragraph. If
                        we haven’t come to agreement on the terms of reference for them, are you
                        free?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: Free. We are hopeful we
                        shall find common language. We have the same tasks.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Assuming we accept
                        unchanged your Article 3, and the terms of reference are unchanged, you feel
                        free . . .</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You could, by refusing to
                        agree to the terms of reference for representatives, use peaceful nuclear

                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: You raise these
                        possibilities of our intentions.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Our Congress will never

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: We should be positive and

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It takes two-thirds.</p>
                    <p>You know and we know we have no intention of circumventing the agreement,
                        because the media will make it evident. In your country we won’t know
                        whether it is for peaceful purposes.</p>

                        until there is an agreement.</p>

                        would not ratify an agreement of this kind if we delayed it ad infinitum. It
                        would not ratify a document which let the American side drag it out
                        indefinitely and delay our peaceful explosions because of artificial
                        problems on terms of reference.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Good. Without inspection.

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: You usually like

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No, we want to know what
                        the terms of reference are. You might put our inspector in a dacha in the

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: So, in which direction are
                        we going? Further, where is the truth situated?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That is the question
                        Pilate asked Christ: What is the truth?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: Who will say Eureka?</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I don’t think the Foreign
                        Minister will spend twenty minutes on a problem without coming up with an
                        answer.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: There was a third-grade
                        class in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and the teacher asked,
                        “Who was the person who said Eureka?” One pupil said Archimedes. The teacher
                        said, “Yes, but when did he say it?” The pupil answered, “While running from
                        the bathroom, he was saying ‛I found it, I found it.’” The third question
                        was, “What did he find?” The pupil said: “Soap.” [Laughter]</p>
                    <p>Probably you elaborated or worked out some approximation to the truth.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: Further from the truth?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We were wondering what
                        would happen when we reconvened. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1"
                            >Stoessel</persName> said, probably <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2"
                            >Gromyko</persName> will accept <persName corresp="#p_MID_1"
                            >Morokhov</persName>’s proposal.</p>
                    <p>If we made the two agreements conditional on each other, we wouldn’t be
                        bringing pressure on you because if they didn’t go into effect, you could
                        continue your peaceful nuclear explosions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: It gives little to us, such
                        a kind of agreement. It is necessary to find a solution to meet your
                        interest as well as ours . . .</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: . . . that the first
                        agreement should enter into force without being conditional on the other
                        one. Similarly, the second one should be assured independently. This is the
                        position.</p>
                    <p>Let’s delete the time period, the concrete condition, and say we will exert
                        all efforts to the speediest conclusion of such an agreement.</p>
                    <p>Frankly speaking, in general, we think, if you don’t have another kind of
                        instruction, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> could agree on peaceful purposes before
                        this date. Because we think you too have a desire on that score.</p>

                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Then we have no
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: Yes. So let’s not put it as
                        a condition. Let’s say the sides will apply energetic efforts to agree on
                        peaceful nuclear explosions in the nearest time.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. Foreign Minister, I
                        don’t question your good faith. But when I negotiated with your allies from
                        Hanoi, whenever we wanted to write a provision where we knew nothing would
                        happen, we put into the agreement “the parties will do their utmost.”
                        Because we knew both sides would do nothing. So my Legal Adviser won’t let
                        me use that phrase.</p>
                    <p>It is possible to say: “Underground nuclear explosions shall be governed by
                        an agreement to be negotiated and concluded by the Parties.” As long as you
                        understand that, while it doesn’t have a conditional phrase in it, we
                        wouldn’t ratify until the agreement is concluded.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: You wouldn’t ratify what?
                        The first agreement or the second?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We would tell our
                        Congress we have made this agreement but we can’t in good conscience ratify
                        it until we have the second one. But at least the agreement wouldn’t be
                        written in conditional form.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: We are agreeing on an
                        acceptable agreement, but the first agreement won’t be ratified without the
                        other. So what can I report tomorrow?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I share your confidence
                        we will be able to come to an agreement on peaceful nuclear explosions. We
                        have over the weekend queried all relevant agencies, and I have the
                        impression that they would work on such an agreement with a positive
                        attitude.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: Your agencies?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Our agencies who would
                        have to do the technical work.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: Your President would look
                        into it; in our country it is the Politburo. In the first instance it is me
                        that is conducting negotiations with you.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That is right.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: Suppose I go to the meeting
                        tomorrow and tell my colleagues that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> said he would use a more flexible formula for
                        joining them together without a hook, but he says the first one wouldn’t
                        enter into force without the second. What kind of progress is that? So where
                        is the truth?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: There is no way around
                        these two choices. We can come to an agreement for peaceful nuclear
                        explosions below the threshold, and then the treaty can go into effect, with
                        a moratorium on tests—peaceful nuclear explosions—above the threshold. Or we
                        have to link <pb n="172" facs="0206" xml:id="pg_172"/>the two together.
                        There is no way around it. We can be extremely flexible in the way we
                        formulate that linkage so it is not very apparent. You summed it up very
                        effectively.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: So it gives nothing. You
                        are just blocking.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Not at all. We have a
                        year and a half to come to an agreement on one category. That is the only
                        loophole. That is the uncertain area.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: You are putting forward an
                        impossible condition, that we agree that you would be in the way of an
                        agreement coming into force if the second is not concluded.</p>
                    <p>Let’s formulate it in another way. Let’s find a most imperative form but
                        delete the variant of linkage of the first to the second and not turn the
                        linkage into a precondition of entering into force of the first. Let’s try
                        to find such a formula. I tried to put forward the formulations: “efforts,”
                        “energetic efforts,” “express confidence that their efforts will be crowned
                        with positive results.” But without formal linkage. You want to put it on
                        steel hooks.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What is the imperative
                        formulation?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: A variant of yours, when
                        you link it to the date. We can say the two sides will do their utmost so as
                        to reach agreement on peaceful nuclear explosions and they express
                        confidence their efforts will be crowned with positive results.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Look, we can put anything
                        into the agreement, and such a formulation is not inconceivable, provided
                        you understand the Senate will not ratify it unless we close the
                        loophole.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: Then the formulation makes
                        no difference.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That is right.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: Because Americans will
                        delay our peaceful explosions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. Foreign Minister,
                        what I want to stress is, in any event you can have peaceful nuclear
                        explosions below the threshold, and for the vast majority of peaceful
                        projects 150 kilotons will be enough.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: You put that in a very
                        clear way. This question is clear, and practically it does not exist.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: So we are talking about
                        very few peaceful explosions above 150 kilotons. I would be amazed if you
                        have done more than ten peaceful nuclear explosions in your whole
                        program.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: Right.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Small explosions for
                        peaceful purposes we will solve. So we won’t interfere with your
                        program.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: You are stressing this;
                        this question doesn’t need to be discussed.</p>
                    <pb n="173" facs="0207" xml:id="pg_173"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No, it does, because if
                        you suddenly did ten tests off the test site, even below the threshold, we
                        would wonder why, because we would have much less data. But this is a
                        soluble problem. So we are talking about the very few above the threshold. I
                        don’t know how many you have done; I am checking it. Maybe you can tell
                        me.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: We are talking about ones

                        general educational character. [Laughter]</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Our practical problem is:
                        You know I have been before the Senate the day before I left, because of a
                        loophole which you know, having been there, doesn’t exist. It had no
                        reality; it was imaginary. Here we are talking about a loophole which
                        anybody could find. So either we will impose this condition or the Senate
                        will. So I understand we can eliminate the conditional phrasing. It will not
                        change the reality but it will ease the formulation problem.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: What is the course of the
                        Administration? It would go to Congress, or more so that you yourself would
                        come out in favor of shelving it?</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I would come out in favor
                        of accepting it but I would say we wouldn’t deposit ratification until we
                        have the other.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: So what is the use of the
                        agreement?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We would have every
                        confidence we could work out the other agreement. After all, it doesn’t make
                        us look particularly good to have worked out an agreement that isn’t
                        implemented. See, our estimation is—I don’t want to debate it—between 1964
                        and 1974 almost all your peaceful nuclear explosions were below the
                        threshold, and only four were above the threshold in the last three years.
                        So we are not talking about a problem that will arise every two weeks.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: In this case we are talking
                        about a question of principle. To us what is impossible is the principle
                        itself. So what kind of alternative do you have, on the basis of which we
                        could come to an understanding?</p>

                        imperative formulation, with removing the conditional aspect to the text.
                        And that will change the public impression of it. But it doesn’t change the
                        reality.</p>

                        don’t have to go to the Senate because we don’t have to go to the Senate
                        until three months before the Treaty goes into effect. So we don’t have to
                        make any conditions. And I assure you our intention is to bring the
                        negotiation on peaceful nuclear explosions to a conclusion, and we will
                        certainly guide our bureaucracy to that effect.</p>

                        wouldn’t approve and it wouldn’t go into force.</p>

                        But if you and we work at it, we can solve it. If you really want peaceful
                        nuclear explosions, without cunning—which I really believe—then it shouldn’t
                        be so difficult to work out the arrangement.</p>

                        for it publicly. Seriously, what we would like in America is to have a

                        to the disadvantage of the United States. It is not in our interest for us
                        to make an agreement that the Senate defeats. It is against our domestic
                        interest. It is also against our foreign policy interest for the Politburo
                        to agree to a text that the Senate rejects. It will make it less likely that
                        they will agree again.</p>

                        time.” And we say nothing about conditions. You probably have a much better

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That is right. We don’t

                        accedes to it. That would present problems.</p>

                        analysis the date of the first of January. The time period is long, and as
                        we say, to think for half a year it doesn’t make great weather. Half a year
                        is half a year. That makes two years. The question is so important from the
                        humanitarian point of view, the time factor should be more taken into
                        account. Therefore, we would like you to agree to the 1st of January.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The 1st of January I am
                        afraid is too complicated for us.</p>

                    <p>Your problem is that “restraint” seems permissive. I am looking for a neutral
                        word so you can say you are for banning it, and we don’t have to say
                        anything.</p>

                        that our views will not be different from yours over a period of time, but I
                        need time to prepare our situation. Words like “measures for effective
                        control.”</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That is provisionally all
                        right.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: “Advocate, “support,”

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: “Support” that somebody’s

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: “For military purposes,”
                        that is: “stands for the broadest possible control over environmental
                        modification techniques for military purposes.” This is not final; it is an
                        idea.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Should I read the

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: Yes.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: After the preambular

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: “The widest possible
                        measures not to permit,” or “with the purpose of prevention.” “With the
                        purpose of not permitting.” This is the meaning.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I think this is about as
                        much as we can do. “Over the use of environmental modification techniques
                        for military purposes.”</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KG_1">Korniyenko</persName>: “The broadest possible
                        measures for control.”</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: The whole purpose is not to
                        permit.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Our ideas are not
                        identical yet.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Then let’s say “control
                        over modification techniques for military purposes.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: Control may be control in
                        favor of military application.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: “Broadest possible
                        limitation?”</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: This is the worst one could
                        possibly think. How would there be limitation? Right now suppose we have X
                        number of rockets, and we say in the future not more than X multiplied by
                        ten. I think we are thinking in the same direction but let us express
                        certain policy in this field.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I know. But the furthest
                        we can go is something along the lines I indicated. “Control over
                        techniques.” In America it would be seen as a big step forward.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: But this could mean control
                        in any direction. Control could be to multiply only by five and not by
                        ten.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We had “restrain,” which
                        means down.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: “Restrain” means we will go
                        in the direction of military purposes but only gradually, by doses, step by
                        step.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: “To curb”? To curb is to
                        restrain, almost the same.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: “Restrain” is more
                        general; “curb” is more strict.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KG_1">Korniyenko</persName>: It means “permit but . .
                        .”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Maybe it isn’t ripe yet
                        in our country.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: It is with difficulty that
                        I can think of the country, say country X, that is not ripe for prevention
                        of modification of natural factors.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I have given you my best

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: All right. But remember,
                        I am incorruptible.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: Shall we resume our
                        deliberations?</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: Can Mr. Sonnenfeldt give us
                        his ideas?</p>
                    <p>Sonnenfeldt: I give the word to the Secretary of State.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You see we have already
                        had our review. “Advocate the broadest possible safeguards against harmful
                        uses of environmental modification techniques for military purposes.”</p>
                    <pb n="181" facs="0215" xml:id="pg_181"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: There is harmful use for
                        military purposes and not harmful uses? Since in a war there are always two
                        countries at least, what is harmful to one is not harmful to the other. What
                        is good for Carthage is not good for Rome.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I was just thinking of it
                        the other way around. And history is written by the victor, so one doesn’t
                        know what it looked like from the Carthaginian point of view.</p>
                    <p>I think the best we can do is a formulation that lets you interpret what you
                        want but leaves vagueness. “Advocate the broadest possible measures to deal
                        with the dangers of environmental modification techniques for military
                        purposes.” But not to say “prevent,” “eliminate.”</p>
                    <p>[Both sides confer.]</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: In the sense of doing
                        away with the dangers, not with the use.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KG_1">Korniyenko</persName>: If you mean only “do
                        something with,” it is not good.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I am trying to leave it

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: What you are suggesting is
                        promotion of the dangers.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I don’t think any
                        English-speaker would understand that as meaning “promote.” It implies
                        removing the danger or eliminating the danger. The problem is the danger of
                        use. If we wanted to say “eliminate the use,” we would say “eliminate the
                        use.”</p>
                    <p>I don’t know the Russian word for “to deal with.”</p>
                    <p>[Both sides confer.]</p>
                    <p>It may be an insoluble problem. We may have to defer for a few weeks or
                        months.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: We are very sorry. You say
                        the country is not ripe; I don’t think the country is not ripe. It is a
                        matter of statesmen.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We are prepared to start

                        needed an hour and a half to put aside for that. But with all these
                        documents to sign, I can’t. When we have finished, my war with the doctor

                    <p>Let’s turn to a starting date. We thought first we would start on the 1st of

                        you will find underground water is so deep that you can’t do it. I was

                    <p>No, April 15 is the realistic figure we gave you.</p>

                        We will strongly defend this treaty but we will also point out that we

                    <p>Yesterday when we discussed the question of dealing with the dangers of use,

                        language that yesterday I withdrew. We will reserve our position for the
                        conference. “Both sides,”—this formula—“advocate the broadest possible

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: The Russian text—“to deal
                        with.” You are better experts in English, and we vice versa. In Russian we
                        will say “with purpose of elimination.”</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: This is the formulation.
                        Does it give this, or does it give permission? Removal or permission.</p>

                        you; neither do we want to mislead ourselves. If it gives the impression of

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If someone is deceived,
                        it is better it be you than we.</p>
                    <p>Let’s be realistic. We understand your position; your position will be to
                        eliminate. We can’t yet state this in a document. Our position is we do not
                        exclude it; you are free to discuss it, but we want a more flexible phrase.
                        “Overcome the dangers” is all right. But we do not want to be told at the
                        first meeting of the Conference that we have already agreed to elimination
                        of it.</p>
                    <p>This will be well received in America. Therefore unless we are forced into
                        it, if you don’t give any explanation, we won’t give any explanation.</p>
                    <p>We may have to give an internal explanation to our government, but not
                        publicly. I don’t think it will come up at a press conference, but if it
                        does, I will say the meaning of “overcome” will be determined by
                        negotiation.</p>

                        offered some introductory remarks before discussing the meeting outcomes.
                        Commenting that the United States and Soviet Union continued to “advance
                        further the relationship” developed during the 1972 Moscow summit and that
                        the pattern of the “expanding range of agreements” contributed toward a
                        “continuing, irreversible process,” <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                            >Nixon</persName> noted that the United States and Soviet Union had
                        “reached a number of important agreements, both in the field of arms
                        limitation and also in the field of peaceful cooperation.” Describing the
                        Threshold Test Ban Treaty, <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>
                        stated:</p>
                    <p>“It extends significantly the earlier steps toward limiting tests that began
                        with the 1963 test-ban treaty. That original treaty barred the signatories
                        from conducting tests in the atmosphere, in outer space, and underwater.
                        Today, we concluded a new treaty that for the first time will also cover
                        tests underground. It will bar both the Soviet Union and the United States,
                        after March 31, 1976, from conducting any underground test of weapons above
                        a certain explosive power, and it will also require both countries to keep
                        tests of weapons below that power to the very minimum number.</p>
                    <p>“This is not only another major step toward bringing the arms race under
                        control, it is also a significant additional step toward reducing the number
                        of nuclear and thermonuclear explosions in the world.” (Ibid., pages

                        agreement to ban underground nuclear tests with yields above 150 kilotons
                        and stated that Britain will consider itself bound by the agreement.</p>
                    <p>2. British are clearly delighted that limited test ban arrangement was agreed
                        at Moscow summit. In a debate yesterday (2 July) Defense Secretary Mason
                        spoke at some length of efforts undertaken by successive British governments
                        to check the proliferation of nuclear arms by supporting the partial test
                        ban and the nonproliferation treaties. He pointed to the duty of all nuclear
                        powers to seek the total abolition of nuclear weapons through multilateral
                        and international agreements, and said he hoped that the <persName

                    </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I want to begin
                        developing a position on nonproliferation, sparked by the Indian peaceful
                        explosion.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1">Moynihan</persName>: That is not what
                        they call it in New Delhi. They call it—the bomb.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: And there is a
                            <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> out on this, isn’t there?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: Yes. It is circulating now
                        for agency comments.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Okay. But I
                        wanted to get my own thinking clear.</p>
                    <p>Who has done this paper—<persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Winston</persName>?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHJ_1">Kahan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_VDCN_1"
                            >Van Doren</persName> have done the basic work on it.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Okay. If you
                        want to sum up where we are.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: The paper itself addresses
                        first the desirability and feasibility of a nonproliferation strategy and
                        lays out one, centering around four main elements: <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                            >NPT</gloss>, export, safeguards, <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>,
                        and reaction to the Indian blast. But rather than summarizing the paper, I
                        thought it might be more useful to kick this off, Mr. Secretary, by posing
                        four or five questions, which I think any policy maker has a right to have
                        answered before he is supposed to embark on a nonproliferation strategy.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Like what we are
                        going to do about it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: That is what the study,
                        hopefully, sets forth.</p>
                    <p>But I think before you get into specific actions or specific hobbyhorses, I
                        think we ought to ask the following kinds of questions, before we ask you or
                        the President to embark on a major effort to intensify <pb n="192"
                            facs="0226" xml:id="pg_192"/>our efforts. Such questions as is the trend
                        towards proliferation inevitable, in any event. Secondly, if we cannot—</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: And if it is
                        not, then we have no right to conduct a policy?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: If it is not
                        inevitable.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: We would argue it is not
                        inevitable, and there are things you can do. But many people do perceive in
                        the world, because of the Indian blast, and the availability of nuclear
                        materials, it is inevitable, and why waste a lot of capital trying to do
                        something about it.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, if you can’t have a completely successful policy, why should you
                        expend your capital, when you cannot completely shut off
                        nonproliferation.</p>
                    <p>Thirdly, are there effective things you can do which don’t cost you too much
                        in other areas, because there are always trade offs, in your objectives
                        between nonproliferation and other objectives.</p>
                    <p>Fourthly, even if the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> could mount an
                        intensive campaign, there are a lot of other players in the game and
                        therefore you cannot act alone and stop all this by yourself,
                        presumably.</p>
                    <p>And lastly, what good is a grand strategy in nonproliferation, because each
                        country, or each possible nuclear country has to be looked at in terms of
                        its own factors and its own conditions.</p>
                    <p>I would like briefly to try to answer each of those reasonable questions that
                        a man has to ask.</p>
                    <p>First, is it inevitable. The answer is—not at all. Many potential nuclear
                        weapons states are far from having a full array of materials and facilities
                        that they need to produce explosives, such as Pakistan, Egypt, and many
                        others. Many others with high technical potential, like Germany and Japan,
                        are inhibited by legal, political and security considerations, and the
                        dependence on us for supplies and the need to acquire delivery systems.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, the Indian test is not necessarily a precedent for everyone else in
                        the world. There are particular factors at work in India. In any event—</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Like what? The
                        Gandhian tradition of non-violence?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: The domestic situation and
                        other factors—</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I am assuming
                        this has been a long-established policy. They didn’t just do it in the last
                        two years.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: I am not so sure the
                        evidence is that conclusive, as long established policy goes. But in any
                        event, it is not necessarily going to be persuasive for other countries,
                        just because India did it, because <pb n="193" facs="0227" xml:id="pg_193"
                        />each country has different factors at work. In any event, there were not
                        safeguards in the Indian case. In addition, there are costs as well as gains
                        in going nuclear, which countries have to weigh. They could become a target
                        of preemptive attack—there are financial costs, political costs, retaliation
                        perhaps by people like ourselves—if we want to cut off fuel for their
                        commercial industry, and so on.</p>
                    <p>So the first question is we don’t think it is necessarily inevitable this
                        trend is going to proliferate.</p>
                    <p>But having said that, there is no way to assure you on the second question
                        that you can be completely successful in stopping proliferation.
                        Nevertheless, even an imperfect attempt, with incomplete success, we think
                        is better than not trying at all. It gains you time to create more stable
                        conditions in various regions around the world, which might decrease
                        incentives to go for a nuclear option. And also once a nation has crossed
                        the threshold, it is very hard to turn it back, and it sets off more of a
                        chain reaction. You have to distinguish countries who might go nuclear.
                        Presumably Japan would be much more serious than Argentina, so you at least
                        make an effort to try to delay or minimize the number of nations.</p>
                    <p>In any event, if we don’t do anything, certainly the situation is going to
                        get much worse, and the pace will pick up, and the spread will be all but
                        inevitable.</p>
                    <p>Thirdly, we face the question of can we do anything, and what are the trade
                        offs in terms of costs. You can do some things which don’t cost you very
                        much—such as strong expressions of support for the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                            >NPT</gloss>, strengthening our safeguards, our exports, etc.</p>
                    <p>Then when you begin to look at trade offs, you have to figure how important
                        is nonproliferation to you in your overall policy. And many would argue that
                        the risks of nuclear conflict are going to greatly escalate if you spread
                        nuclear weapons around the world; our diplomatic influence will decrease;
                        arms control progress will be set back.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Would
                        decrease?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: Decrease to the extent that
                        other nations get nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That I would
                        question.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: In any event, you have the
                        greater threat of blackmail. I just think a proliferated world is a more
                        dangerous world. Therefore—</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But supposing—I
                        am willing to accept all of this. I am willing to postulate the opposite of
                        what you have said—that it is probably inevitable. But we should
                        nevertheless try to slow it down.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: Right.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Now, what are we
                        going to do about it?</p>
                    <pb n="194" facs="0228" xml:id="pg_194"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: Well, there are certain
                        things we do which the paper outlines. And keep in mind that other nations
                        have to do something, too, because we are not going to have complete
                        control. And here the situation isn’t so bad, because in the near term the
                        suppliers are basically serious about this. The Russians, the British are
                        good on this. The Canadians are going to be very firm. They have made some
                        mistakes in the past. The only problem is France in the near term. And
                        France—the last couple of days, they are holding up at least temporarily a
                        contract with India, because of the non-proliferation.</p>
                    <p>Now, what we can do is outline in the paper—and we can summarize that for
                        now, if you wish—but I thought the first thing to do is try to pose these
                        tough questions.</p>
                    <p>Does it even make sense to mount a major effort before you can get into the
                        specific actions.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: It is essentially a
                        question of getting a delay—ten to fifteen years. What is beyond is probably
                        unpredictable. But without the delay, we may get a rather rapid reaction,
                        which would have very adverse psychological impact and real impact a few
                        years later.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: South Africa
                        announced today—</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: That is one. Argentina and
                        Brazil are competing with each other to some extent, and would be stimulated
                        by each other—there is clear evidence.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What is
                        Argentina going to use for nuclear materials—what we gave them?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: They have a German reactor
                        there, where the safeguards are not adequate. And they are talking about a
                        chemical processing plant later on. It would be a number of years down the
                        road. But moving into it more aggressively, it would stimulate the
                        Brazilians. The Brazilians have said so recently.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH_1">Pollack</persName>: The Argentinians are in
                        the process of concluding an agreement with India in the nuclear area. They
                        would have a very small capacity to supply them with materials, but
                        nevertheless, it is a possibility.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Do you think,
                        Pat, India would do it?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1">Moynihan</persName>: It would do
                        anything that they can do. And they cannot do a lot yet, but they will
                        certainly be able to do more.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Would they be
                        willing to help other countries get nuclear explosives?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1">Moynihan</persName>: For money, they
                        would do anything.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHJ_1">Kahan</persName>: They have suggested things
                        along those lines. One of the issues is to discuss with them whether they
                        intend to put proper safeguards on their exports. It is a longer term issue,
                        but it is an important one.</p>
                    <pb n="195" facs="0229" xml:id="pg_195"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: To answer your question
                        more specifically, what we can do, the paper tries to outline specifically
                        the various steps you could take under these headings, and they cut across
                        all countries. You have to take each country specifically and target it, and
                        look at the facts at work in that particular country, the levers you have,
                        and your tradeoffs with other issues and other priorities. But this paper
                        does set out what the broad elements are.</p>
                    <p>I think we do need more study on two aspects. One—take countries that are the
                        major target areas, what you can do and what it costs you. And secondly, we
                        ought to be studying what it is going to be like to live in a proliferated
                        world. I think you have to plan for that contingency.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. That we
                        need in any event.</p>
                    <p>Well, there are two problems, at least. One is to prevent a possible military
                        application of nuclear explosives. The second is to prevent peaceful nuclear
                        explosives from being used as a road into the military use.</p>
                    <p>Now, the reason I make this distinction is because if countries can be kept
                        from having an avowedly military program, if one can then get an
                        international regime for peaceful nuclear explosives, one might be able to
                        put some restraint on using peaceful nuclear explosives as a road into the
                        nuclear field.</p>
                    <p>It is one thing for a country to avow that it is going militarily nuclear. It
                        is another for it to get in through the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                        >PNE</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Now, <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Fred</persName>, what you and I talked
                        about this morning with the Soviet Union could then multilateralize. It
                        could become a very effective restraint and might be a way of catching part
                        of the Indian program even now.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: I think in addition, it is
                        important to try to close the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> loophole
                        in any further exports. We would get agreements they would not develop these
                        nuclear explosives. It is very hard to distinguish—</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Ideally, you would want to
                        dissuade Brazil, for instance, or Argentina from doing their own <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> development, by us or the Russians, or
                        some combination, maybe through IEA, offering these devices for their
                        purposes, peaceful purposes. You cannot do that any more in the case of
                        India. You might have a hybrid situation where at least a country such as
                        India would proceed in a way as to minimize the stimulation to Pakistan to
                        go after Chinese help or French help, as they are now doing, to develop
                        their own weapons—and minimize also the Indian willingness to try to acquire
                        deliberately, as they are now discussing.</p>
                    <p>So I think the hybrid situation, where the country has semi-legitimate <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>, is perhaps only India, and hopefully no
                        additional countries in that difficult category. But there may be additional
                        ones.</p>
                    <pb n="196" facs="0230" xml:id="pg_196"/>
                    <p>Then the other countries which have national interest, either faked or real,
                        in peaceful nuclear explosives, such as Brazil, one would hope to dissuade
                        from moving ahead much further in their own development, by offering them
                        the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>, in a sense calling their bluff on
                        that.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sonnenfeldt: What the Secretary was arguing is if the United States and
                        the Soviet Union, as part of the threshold test ban, develop a regime by
                        which you can establish with reasonable assurance that <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> are not in fact used for military
                        purposes, because you provide observers and instrumentation and all the
                        other things, that then you will have established for the first time a
                        distinction that we have always said cannot really be established, and you
                        may therefore have a handle on people who in fact claim they are exploding
                        peaceful devices.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Exactly. You
                        might not be able to keep them from exploding the first one, but you may be
                        able to keep them from refining them.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: There is a problem there,
                        though. The only possible verification that we can envisage for the Russian
                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>, above the threshold, is one that
                        may be satisfactory to us, because we know they have weapons of various
                        magnitude in advanced stages. So we can check on the basis of the
                        observations we might make that they do not develop more advanced weapons
                        than they already have. But that kind of verification would not help us in
                        case of another country for which the fundamental weapon would be quite
                        sufficient.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But you at least
                        can keep them from developing the rudimentary weapon further.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Not with the safeguards or
                        with the verification procedures that we now are exploring with regard to
                        the Soviet Union under the threshold test ban. Those would only help us to
                        verify that the Russians are not testing more advanced weapons.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sonnenfeldt: We don’t know that yet, and we really have not gone through
                        that exercise completely.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHJ_1">Kahan</persName>: Mr. Secretary, there is a
                        danger already, and we see it in the traffic from India—that a perception
                        that we will develop a fool-proof scheme to differentiate between peaceful
                        and military—a position we have not taken heretofore—will legitimatize the
                        Indian program, by saying there is a distinction, and furthermore a danger
                        that Brazil and other nations interested in <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNEs</gloss> will therefore assume that we have such a basis of making
                        distinctions, will be more likely to cross the threshold, taking a peaceful
                        route, and end up with a de facto nuclear weapons capability.</p>
                    <p>So how we walk the line—</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That is what I
                        want to have examined. The Indians have crossed the threshold. So that is
                        not a major worry.</p>
                    <pb n="197" facs="0231" xml:id="pg_197"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: It seems overall the thing
                        to work on is the delaying of these further steps, delaying rapid succession
                        of Indian tests, which might come every six months or so otherwise; delaying
                        the Pakistani acquisition of facilities to develop their weapons.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: How close are
                        they to developing facilities?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: They tried to acquire them
                        from the French, or perhaps from China. But it will take them a number of
                        years—five to eight years; which, incidentally, provides an argument for
                        probably New Delhi in that they might recognize by going more slowly they
                        maintain more of an advantage than by stimulating the Pakistanis.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: The specific actions
                        recommended, Mr. Secretary, start on page 5 of the study, in which the four
                        main headings are what you can do with the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                            >NPT</gloss> structure, what you have to do outside of that, given the
                        fact that some people won’t ratify it, but what you could do in terms of
                        export controls; what we have developed so far in the <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> problem remains to be studied further; and
                        fourthly, how you limit the Indian event.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, I have read
                        this. I have read the paper. The problem is that in each of these areas, we
                        suffer from a rather indiscriminating melange of things that could be done.
                        For example, consulting promptly with the Soviet Union, on page 6—that is
                        one thing. But handling of demands for security assurances, joint
                            Soviet-<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> security assurances, if that
                        is what is in mind, that is a rather significant event. And that is
                        something that perhaps could be considered in one or two cases. But we
                        cannot let nonproliferation ride every aspect of our policy. If we hand out
                        security assurances jointly with the Soviet Union, we are getting awfully
                        close into a condominium situation. And we will have impacts in China and
                        Europe of the most severe nature, which in themselves might produce a
                        nuclear race. And I don’t know whether Japan would want to rely on the
                        Soviet security assurance.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: I agree. Some things you
                        can do fairly quickly.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But if the
                        countries feel the only way they can get protection is through a <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet guarantee, they might then decide
                        they would rather have their own. If the alternative is your own nuclear
                        capability or a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet guarantee, that
                        might spur your own nuclear capability, because there are some countries
                        that don’t want a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet guarantee.
                        There are other countries that want a guarantee that believe the United
                        States and the Soviet Union will never be able to agree on anything in time
                        to help them.</p>
                    <p>So either on grounds of insufficiency or on grounds of condominium, that
                        might run you into a situation where it actually spurs proliferation.</p>
                    <pb n="198" facs="0232" xml:id="pg_198"/>
                    <p>So what I think we ought to do with this paper is to disentangle—first of
                        all, I would like the thing looked at from the point of view, with the
                        qualification which you made, of whether it is possible to separate the
                        military proliferation from the civilian proliferation problem. Secondly, if
                        you can separate the military from the civilian proliferation, whether it is
                        possible to get a handle on the civilian proliferation, either by supplying
                        devices, assured supplying of devices, or whatever the methods are—or as a
                        worst case, by inspecting their own explosions, although I grant you that at
                        the very early stages of nuclear technology it is the fact of an explosion
                        and not the use to which it is put which provides the significance.</p>
                    <p>So I would not be very hopeful that the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        negotiations with the Soviet Union are going to help us in the early stages
                        of nuclear diffusion.</p>
                    <p>The next thing we have to look at is the impact of nuclear—the inevitable
                        spread, which I do consider inevitable—of civilian nuclear users, on the
                        problem of nuclear proliferation. And that is usually done in terms of
                        safeguards.</p>
                    <p>But what about the problem—I don’t know the answer to that. Supposing a
                        country that has accepted adequate safeguards kicks us out. What is the
                        situation then? And gets its own supply of uranium.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: It depends on your
                        leverage. For example, in Taiwan, if they were to go nuclear, we supply, as
                        I understand it, the fuel for six reactors. If we cut that off, it would be
                        a tremendous impact.</p>
                    <pb n="199" facs="0233" xml:id="pg_199"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If they cannot
                        get it elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH_1">Pollack</persName>: That is what the Congress
                        has been asking all week with respect to the Egyptian reactor.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What is your
                        answer?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH_1">Pollack</persName>: We have been giving them
                        this kind of answer—</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What is the true
                        answer? Tell me what you really think.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: It is also the type of
                        reactor—</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH_1">Pollack</persName>: We are supplying a
                        reactor that requires a fuel that is not generally available. Now, if you
                        move this thing down the road about fifteen years, then all of the
                        assurances that we are now offering begin to get very, very soft and watery.
                        But over and beyond the fuel, the equipment itself, it is not like an
                        automobile where you can turn a mechanic loose and keep it in shape. This is
                        very, very difficult technology to sustain and maintain, and they need a
                        continuing relationship with the supplier. So you have it in your ability,
                        the capability—</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Not with “the”
                        supplier; with “a” supplier.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH_1">Pollack</persName>: No. As matters now stand,
                        with “the” supplier.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Really?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH_1">Pollack</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:
                        Indefinitely?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH_1">Pollack</persName>: No. There comes a point
                        in time when all of these assurances are very watery.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHJ_1">Kahan</persName>: One strategy is to try to
                        talk to the other potential suppliers of enriched uranium. We are
                        undertaking such a program, to see if we can coordinate—</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That is part of
                        the program. I am trying to understand what the problem is.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH_1">Pollack</persName>: We eventually get back to
                        this question, to saying that there are other sanctions available to a
                        government that desires to exercise them—economic, political, etc. And what
                        we are doing is saying there is no agreement that cannot be broken. And what
                        do you do when one is broken that you don’t want broken. There is no
                        technical answer to this problem that would provide you with a permanent
                        assurance. You are good for about fifteen years, without any question.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Because there
                        are no other countries that have the technology.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH_1">Pollack</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: And after that,
                        you would be good for longer, if you could line up the other countries.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH_1">Pollack</persName>: Yes, sir. Efforts in the
                        past to line up the other countries, through something called the Zanger
                        Committee, which is discussed in here, would not give you any reason for
                        optimism, because this is a very commercial enterprise, and everybody has
                        his hands or his eyes on where his ability to compete with the United States
                        will be down the road.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: There are just a few
                        countries where the decision is in the balance. Particularly the Canadians
                        are agonizing—should they pursue their commercial interests and sell to the
                        South Koreans, for instance, Argentinians, or try to pursue these safeguards
                        in their exports. They want to talk to us urgently.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Before they
                        decide to pursue their commercial interests.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: I think their decision will
                        be affected by what we tell them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sonnenfeldt: I think it is going the other way.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: In Canada?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: The Canadians are very firm
                        on this.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: I think after the election
                        they may be more likely to continue to support the safeguards. The other
                        potential exporter of course is the Soviets. But I think they, too, so far
                        have been supportive of safeguards. And that is where our discussions with
                        them might—</p>
                    <pb n="200" facs="0234" xml:id="pg_200"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You have two
                        separate problems in safeguards. You have the problem of safeguards now. You
                        have the problem of safeguarding that they won’t step in to replace us
                        fifteen years from now.</p>
                    <p>Isn’t that right?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH_1">Pollack</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: So there are two
                        different safeguards involved. One is to make sure that everybody capable of
                        selling reactors now will insist on the same safeguards, and to avoid a
                        situation where you get into a competitive bidding on the basis of who
                        offers the least intrusive safeguards. That is Point One. That we have to
                        negotiate now.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, we should negotiate now, or at any rate in the next few years, how
                        to prevent evasions where one country steps into the place of another, when
                        safeguards are being violated. Isn’t that right?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH_1">Pollack</persName>: Yes, sir.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: And that is even
                        more complicated.</p>
                    <p>When you talk about fifteen years, you are saying within a fifteen-year
                        period no one can replace us in the operation of our reactors.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH_1">Pollack</persName>: Right. It is actually
                        probably a little more than fifteen years.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: All
                        right—twenty. After that, others may be able to step in. But how about the
                        host country? Can they just take it over?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH_1">Pollack</persName>: Not a country like Egypt.
                        I don’t think they will be that far along in twenty years. But what you are
                        going to be witnessing in the course of the next two decades is a tremendous
                        growth in the technological capability of the world as a whole to deal in
                        nuclear energy. So the kind of know-how that is required, that is not now
                        available, will become much more plentiful.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Also in twenty years, the
                        new techniques will be available for enriching uranium. It is a fifteen year
                        time horizon we should focus on.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH_1">Pollack</persName>: It may be a backyard
                        technology by then. So now is the time to move one way or the other.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: It seems to me there are
                        some things you can do quickly that don’t cost too much or require great
                        study—like security assurances have to be studied very carefully, obviously.
                        But you can make public expressions of support, you can go to various
                        countries and try to persuade them.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: How can you go
                        to various countries and persuade them of what?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: Persuade them not to go
                        nuclear.</p>
                    <pb n="201" facs="0235" xml:id="pg_201"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: How do you do
                        that?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: Well, you say you consider
                        it a high principle in your policy, and it will cost them in your bilateral
                        relations if they do.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Except that that
                        is not all that persuasive. It depends on the importance of the country.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: As I say, you have to talk
                        to individual countries with the leverage you have.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: As you look over
                        the list of countries, you will find you are back in your original
                        situation. A country that means a great deal to you, you will not let go
                        down the drain just because it has gone nuclear, even if you don’t like it.
                        And we haven’t gone all out against India to the dismay of several who think
                        I owe them a tilt—(Laughter)—but partly because we didn’t see where it would
                        get us.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1">Moynihan</persName>: Can I say on
                        that, the question of time horizons, on the point where this stuff becomes a
                        technology that other people pick up in 15 years, maybe—but with respect to
                        the first point, which is how to prevent this first <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> going into a military phase right away. You probably don’t
                        have six months in some respects to move. If the Pakistanis get themselves a
                        separation plant, which for them will mean they are going to a bomb
                        themselves, the Indians will almost automatically then say, “Since this has
                        happened, we must develop our peaceful capacity . . .” and the military one,
                        they will start almost immediately, in a direct bomb technology, and they
                        will probably also start immediately—they are already well down the road in
                        rocketry. When that happens, then you have Iran. But in any event, you have
                        started that Pakistan-Indian thing up already. I mean there it goes. And it
                        is out of control at that point. What we do in the next six months is
                        probably going to—</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Like what?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1">Moynihan</persName>: Well, can we—the
                        thing we would have to do is to persuade the Indians not go to a bomb on the
                        grounds that we can persuade the Pakistanis not to. And if—</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What makes you
                        think either of these is possible? First of all, I don’t know what it means
                        for India not go to a bomb.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1">Moynihan</persName>: You are always
                        doing amazing things. It would be amazing.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: A slowdown in testing—</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH_1">Pollack</persName>: Well, one thing—</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That I can
                        understand. But after all, you would have to assume that anything that
                        explodes can be used as a bomb.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1">Moynihan</persName>: You could ask
                        them to enter a regime, such as we may be negotiating with the Soviets.</p>
                    <pb n="202" facs="0236" xml:id="pg_202"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: With what?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1">Moynihan</persName>: You could ask
                        the Indians to enter—let me just say I think the most important thing is for
                        the Indians, they have got soon enough to realize that if their weapon, or
                        their explosion means that the Paks go nuclear too, then suddenly a military
                        situation that has been finally and once and for all settled in favor of
                        India puffs up and you are back at parity again. I mean you have Pakistan
                        saying they will target Bombay, and Indian rockets targeted on Karachi, and
                        you are back in the 1950s all over again.</p>
                    <p>That is one thing I think we could seriously make the argument on—that it
                        would be a disaster for them to let the Paks go nuclear, and Pakistan will
                        go nuclear, unless they hold their <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        right there. I think you can make this argument.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: What you can deliver is to
                        slow down the testing.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1">Moynihan</persName>: Slow it down,
                        stretch it out, let it be inspected.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: How do the
                        Pakistanis know they are not building a thousand bombs of the design they
                        just exploded?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1">Moynihan</persName>: They don’t. We
                        would have to undertake to guarantee something of that kind.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What was it—20
                        kilotons?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1">Moynihan</persName>: Fifteen.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, that seems
                        to be the standard size of the first explosion.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH_1">Pollack</persName>: [<hi rend="italic">3
                            lines not declassified</hi>] They have two reactors of the kind that
                        Canada supplied. Within two years of being in production. They have
                        everything else they need. They have got a facility with 10,000 people in
                        it. They are not an underdeveloped country in the nuclear area. This is one
                        area where they are developed.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: [<hi
                            rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH_1">Pollack</persName>: I think possibly more
                        than that. Out of non-safeguarded reactors—they don’t have to violate
                        anything. Or at least anything more than they have already violated in their
                        understanding with Canada.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VDCN_1">Van Doren</persName>: The source of this
                        present bomb, the research reactors, they have other calls on that. They
                        have a fast breeder reactor program which also needs—</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH_1">Pollack</persName>: They would have to make a
                        decision they are going to go for the weapon instead of the fast
                        breeder.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: You ask how the Paks know.
                        How they use the plutonium, whether they use it in peaceful reactors or
                        divert it secretly is something the Paks could observe. So they would have
                        some assurance.</p>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I don’t see any
                        sense in going at India until we have some strategy of what we are trying to
                        do.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: The time involved—if you
                        visit there at the time of your visit.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The last time I
                        was in India, they had to send the Ambassador in the big car and me in a
                        taxi, to divert attention.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1">Moynihan</persName>: No—to let him
                        get stoned.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: To let him get
                        stoned—that was the purpose, exactly. I didn’t think they were
                        discriminating against me.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH_1">Pollack</persName>: What you do have that you
                        could move on perhaps more quickly is the psychological moment, with Canada,
                        the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>, possibly some of the other potential
                        large suppliers.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I won’t be going
                        to India until September, maybe even October— So that time frame suits me
                        fine. That gives us two months to work out the strategy. I think we will be
                        more effective in India if we can fit it into an overall strategy. And also
                        if we can have preliminary discussions with the Soviet Union. There is
                        absolutely no sense in taking on India, and driving them to the Soviet Union
                        on that issue, unless we have an understanding with the Soviet Union of
                        cooperative action. I would have very little stomach for taking on the
                        Indians on this if I thought the only result would be that the Soviet Union
                        would pick up some cheap support.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1">Moynihan</persName>: I would like to
                        urge that the only conditions you could hope to have any success with the
                        Indians right now would be that this is a world policy in the United States,
                        and we would like India to join it—rather than as a policy for India.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: In that way, I
                        think we can get some benefit for not having taken them on all out, because
                        then it would not be discriminating against them—it would be something that
                        we want to generally apply. But for that we need a more differentiated paper
                        than we now have, which isolates only the categories but not the strategies.
                        And that is not a criticism of the paper. That had to be done as a first cut
                        at it.</p>
                    <p>So again, just to sum up. We first see whether we can distinguish the
                        military from the civilian on proliferation, simply as a device for getting
                        at it. Secondly, we will try to identify those parts of the civilian
                        proliferation that we are worried about. I suppose reactor technology,
                        fuels, and so forth. Third, we have to group the countries—third, we ought
                        to identify those things the United States can do alone and those things for
                        which it needs an international consensus—especially how we can avoid
                        competitive bidding on safeguards with respect to nuclear technology. Then
                        we can develop a strategy in which we determine which other nuclear
                        countries we have to deal with, to prevent proliferation, because we have to
                        deal with Japan on two levels; one as a nuclear supplier, and other as a
                        potential nuclear weapons country.</p>
                    <pb n="204" facs="0238" xml:id="pg_204"/>
                    <p>Isn’t that true? Japan could export nuclear technology.</p>
                    <p>Now, could we do this, in these categories, as a joint <gloss
                            target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss>-Policy Planning—your shop—could we give
                        it a fairly short deadline, say having another paper in about two weeks?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: I think we should make it
                        shorter.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Ten days?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Some of these things are
                        urgent, like talking to the Canadians, and the French, if we can.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I am very
                        reluctant to talk to anybody until I know what we want. And the general
                        hand-wringing position, in which we fail with nonproliferation but have no
                        concrete view of what we want from them—I think when we meet them—when we
                        talk to them, we ought to say “This is our view of how the civilian
                        technology should be kept under control. This is our view of how those
                        countries that already have a technology can be given inducements to go
                        towards the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> route, through the <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> route to military technology.” And third,
                        how we can keep countries that have already committed themselves, like
                        India, to <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>, from going military.</p>
                    <p>Those three levels ought to be—a week from Monday, then. Then I can address
                        this problem again.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: On the second one, we do
                        have fairly concrete points, in that IEA has been dealing with these export
                        controls. There are long technical lists of what is to be done and not to be
                        done. The problem there is more to get, for example, the French government
                        to observe these rules, which they are fully aware of.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If we could list
                        the things we need done, and then what we want from the suppliers, and what
                        we want from the recipients—then we can formulate a strategy. Then we might
                        consider holding a conference first of supplier countries, and then see what
                        we can do towards recipients.</p>
                    <p>On this one I think we ought to talk to the Soviets first of all.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH_1">Pollack</persName>: The Soviets,
                        incidentally, in Vienna—Mordikoff (?) has told our representative, in
                        chiding terms, in effect we are not doing enough about India.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1">Moynihan</persName>: And the British
                        have come in to say “Aren’t you going to do anything about it?”</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We will be
                        delighted to do something, once we have a general strategy. But now to take
                        on India, before we know what anything [<hi rend="italic">any</hi>?]
                        supplier is going to say—we ought to be able by the middle of August to have
                        a general policy, shouldn’t we? Then we can approach India. But then we can
                        also approach a lot of other countries.</p>
                    <pb n="205" facs="0239" xml:id="pg_205"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName>: I think we should have
                        a general strategy. I think we should approach the Indians. I think we
                        should do some other things before approaching the Indians, to have
                        credibility when we approach the Indians.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I just don’t
                        think this handwringing, do-good attitude, in which we tend to specialize so
                        much—I don’t want lectures to the Indians on non-proliferation—</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1">Moynihan</persName>: They win on
                        lectures.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: They win on
                        lectures—that’s right. If we can tell them something concrete, that we are
                        going to ask of all others, with some implicit penalties, because we have
                        already lined up some other countries, then I think we are talking a
                        language they understand. If we talk the abstract disadvantages of
                        nonproliferation to them, we are in an endless debate.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: I think the elements are
                        here. There are some concrete steps. This is not just atmosphere in this
                        paper. It is a matter of what you say to all suppliers, how you talk in each
                        country.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What we have
                        here is a laundry list of everything we can possibly do. We have no
                        priorities, no discrimination.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: With all due respect, I
                        don’t think that is entirely accurate. What I am saying is—</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Is somebody
                        going to put it in the shape that I can understand it?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: That is why it will take us
                        only a week.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I am not saying
                        it is not here.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: We will have to repackage
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH_1">Pollack</persName>: May I raise a question,
                        without wringing my hands and making a fancy speech—might it not be helpful
                        for us to come out with a statement fairly promptly, reaffirming in general
                        terms where we stand on the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>; because in
                        the absence of that, our position on ratification by Japan, within Japan,
                        finding it easier—</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I think we have
                        a better chance of getting the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> ratified
                        once we have a general nonproliferation strategy, into which the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> fits. I think otherwise, the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> will simply look like a discriminatory
                        device. If we can have this thing done in three weeks, I don’t think the
                        decision in Japan will be affected decisively in three weeks.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sonnenfeldt: Actually we just said in the Soviet communiqué we want to
                        make it more effective.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: You can say you are
                        concerned about nonproliferation, and studying what to do about it, if you
                        want to say anything.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That I welcome.
                        We can say we are having an urgent study made. As this thing progresses, we
                        could have the British <pb n="206" facs="0240" xml:id="pg_206"/>over here,
                        for preliminary consultation, and that will get the word around. All of that
                        I am in favor of—once we know what we want, even approximately. And then by
                        the middle of August or so we can have our course set. What we have to do in
                        this paper is to identify the countries, both on the supplier side and
                        on—</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH_1">Pollack</persName>: If I may make one other
                        point. I don’t want to say anything more at this time. I think we need to
                        keep a very close eye on the Congress, because the range of hearings and the
                        interest they have shown in the Egyptian thing has taken, among other forms,
                        on the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>, for example, why do we not
                        simply require Egypt and Israel to become adherents to the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> before we supply them.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Because the
                        Israelis don’t want that, if you want to be brutal about it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH_1">Pollack</persName>: There are some
                        resolutions and bills floating around on the floor, and something may end up
                        we have to deal with.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I think we will
                        be able to handle the Congress most easily, if we know what our genuine
                        strategy is. If our strategy is that we will require each country to ratify
                        the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>, I am delighted to do it—and then
                        to approach Israel on that basis.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sonnenfeldt: I think we should be realistic, in that adherence to the
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> is not the only way to stop a
                        country from becoming nuclear.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH_1">Pollack</persName>: We have given them that.
                        Your problem here I think is the next two weeks—this is when there will be
                        the heat of this congressional concern.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The adherence to
                        the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> doesn’t close the <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> route at all, which is the one—</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VDCN_1">Van Doren</persName>: Yes, it does,
                        specifically. That is specifically what it does.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sonnenfeldt: But the fact is that people won’t join it. If you say that
                        the only way to stop them from going nuclear is by forcing them to join the
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>, you foreclose other options.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: No one is saying that.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VDCN_1">Van Doren</persName>: Actually among the
                        major suppliers, all the major suppliers, except France, are signatories—all
                        present major suppliers are either signatories or parties to this treaty. If
                        they all become parties, you would have a real handle on your supply
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sonnenfeldt: That is an “if”. There must be other ways to get at the
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: That is the French
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName>: India can become a
                        supplier, too.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The trap you can
                        get yourself into is if you say the way to do it is through the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>, that then you either get <pb n="207"
                            facs="0241" xml:id="pg_207"/>countries signing the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> and later revoking it, having established
                        their nuclear capability—you may then forego the safeguard route, which
                        gives you a better protection than simply signing a treaty which you can
                        later break. Now, I admit breaking treaties has certain penalties.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VDCN_1">Van Doren</persName>: The <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> requires—</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: The <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> is only one of many tools.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: There is no
                        objection to using the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> as one of the
                        tools.</p>
                    <p>Okay.</p>
                    <p>Well, why don’t we proceed on this basis and meet again within two weeks.</p>
                    <p>(Whereupon at 4:50 p.m. the meeting was adjourned.)</p>

                    <p>10984. Subject: The Summit in Retrospect.</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>. The Soviet leadership’s performance during
                        the summit left some lingering questions. Why was Andropov absent? Why was
                        there more emphasis on collectivity, and a de-emphasis of personal ties?
                        Does <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> have health problems?
                        On the whole, however, their performance demonstrated continued stability
                        and confirmed their concerted policy of pursuing better relations with the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                    </p>
                    <p>2. Post-summit Soviet propaganda has sought to put the best face on the
                        results. In part this is a genuine assessment, reflecting the Soviet
                        tendency to focus on atmospherics. Nevertheless, there are signs of second
                        thoughts about the failure to achieve progress on arms limitations. We do
                        not know whether before the summit <persName corresp="#p_BL_1"
                            >Brezhnev</persName> knocked heads together in his own bureaucracy in an
                        unsuccessful attempt to forge a more forthcoming position on <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> issues; certainly there were no sore
                        heads on display during the summit. The breadth of knowledge of test ban
                        issues at the top on the Soviet side during the summit was <pb n="208"
                            facs="0242" xml:id="pg_208"/>not impressive; if the Soviet leaders are
                        equally vague on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> issues, they may be
                        dangerously dependent on their experts, who seem to be predominantly
                        military. We should hope that the new studies now under way around Moscow
                        will prove edifying for the leaders and helpful to the <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> talks. <hi rend="italic">End
                            summary</hi>.</p>
                    <p>3. Despite the lack of agreement on strategic offensive arms at the summit,
                        Soviet propaganda has sought to demonstrate progress on arms control issues.
                        Post-summit commentary has put arms control achievements foremost among the
                        week’s accomplishments. And <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> Institute
                        Director <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> has told visiting
                        Americans that new studies are underway in several offices in Moscow,
                        including his own, in an effort to draw up appropriate new instructions from
                        Geneva.</p>
                    <p>4. The curious performance of the top three leaders on the test ban issue
                        during the summit raises some questions. Their first run at the
                        comprehensive test ban proposal, with long contributions from each, was an
                        understandable gambit from their point of view. Repeating the whole process
                        again, after the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> response, seemed
                        strange. Even stranger was their vagueness about what had been negotiated on
                        underground testing; on this, even <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2"
                            >Gromyko</persName> did not seem well informed. Perhaps they showed a
                        better grasp of issues involved in strategic weapons discussions, but there
                        is a lingering suspicion that they may have difficulty grasping the
                        technicalities and they are therefore at the mercy of their predominantely
                        military experts. In this context, educative attempts such as <persName
                            corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName>’s <hi rend="italic">Izvestiya</hi>
                        article (Moscow septel) are particularly noteworthy. Let us hope that
                        franker and more persuasive papers are being officially circulated and
                        comprehended.</p>
                    <p>5. Soviet journalists, expanding on <persName corresp="#p_BL_1"
                            >Brezhnev</persName>’s Spaso toast remark that more could have been
                        achieved, have applied it specifically to the area of strategic arms and
                        suggested that one reason is the President’s domestic situation, which made
                        it necessary for him to protect his right flank. Possibly the Soviets
                        believe this; <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> said that
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> had been warned in
                        advance by Soviet Americanologists that <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                            >Nixon</persName> was locked into a conservative position on <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. In any case, the implication that the
                        Soviets had been ready to move on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        serves the dual purpose of making them look reasonable on arms control and
                        turning upside down the argument that they were prepared to take advantage
                        of the President’s problems at home.</p>
                    <p>6. While taking care to do nothing to undercut President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>, the Soviets have used the summit to
                        emphasize that bilateral relations go beyond the personal ties between the
                        two leaders. Unlike 1973 (admittedly a different situation since <persName
                            corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> visited the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> without <persName corresp="#p_PNV_1"
                            >Podgorny</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1"
                        >Kosygin</persName>), recent commentaries have not particularly emphasized
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s personal role in
                        détente. There is no resonance in the Soviet press to the President’s
                        references in his toasts to his <pb n="209" facs="0243" xml:id="pg_209"
                        />personal relationship with <persName corresp="#p_BL_1"
                        >Brezhnev</persName>, and <gloss target="#t_TASS_1">TASS</gloss>—possibly on
                        purpose—even omitted one of those references from its Russian translation.
                        In any case, Soviet propagandists have consistently cited support for the
                        summit by Democratic luminaries such as <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1"
                            >Kennedy</persName> and Harriman to emphasize that Moscow’s view of
                        détente is not limited to one party or one President.</p>
                    <p>7. In addition to the press play, there was some indication at the summit
                        itself of a tendency to slip <persName corresp="#p_BL_1"
                        >Brezhnev</persName>’s personal dominance of foreign policy back a notch or
                        two. Perhaps this impression was deliberately cultivated in order to play
                        down the personal aspect of summitry. In any case, these points are worth
                        noting:</p>
                    <p>A. The Soviet side took a more collegial approach to plenaries. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s statements frequently were
                        followed by contributions by <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName>
                        and <persName corresp="#p_PNV_1">Podgorny</persName>, which did not
                        necessarily add anything but appeared to be for the record. Often President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>’s turn came after all
                        three had spoken. This contrasts with 1972, when <persName corresp="#p_BL_1"
                            >Brezhnev</persName> made nearly all the programmatic statements (except
                        on trade), to which President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>
                        then responded; on that occasion, <persName corresp="#p_PNV_1"
                            >Podgorny</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName>
                        had to push in their remarks, if any, toward the end of the sessions.</p>
                    <p>B. <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> did not appear as well
                        briefed, or at least as able to make easy application of his briefings, as
                        in 1973. Occasionally, especially in the afternoons, he showed
                        symptoms—flushed face, overbright eyes—which might have, perhaps mistakenly,
                        been taken for the results of over-imbibing. The airport return from the
                        Black Sea on July 1 was such an occasion; he also stumbled on the stairway.
                        But, nevertheless, he went immediately into an airport meeting with the
                        Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName> and as usual
                        dominated it from the Soviet side. On this and other occasions, he seemed
                        quite fatigued.</p>
                    <p>C. The atmosphere of easy camaraderie between <persName corresp="#p_BL_1"
                            >Brezhnev</persName> and his colleagues continued unchanged, and we saw
                        no evidence of tension among them.</p>
                    <p>8. Some comments are also in order regarding other members of the
                        Politburo.</p>
                    <p>A. <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName> seemed vigorous and in
                        good health. His contributions in negotiations tended to be relatively
                        substantive and well-informed, while not breaking any new ground. He usually
                        spoke after <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> but before
                            <persName corresp="#p_PNV_1">Podgorny</persName>, contrary to formal
                        rank ordering. On social occasions he seemed relaxed and—for him—relatively
                        convivial. He was the one who took charge in arranging for <gloss
                            target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss> negotiations to follow up on summit
                        discussions.</p>
                    <p>B. <persName corresp="#p_PNV_1">Podgorny</persName>’s interventions were less
                        frequent, briefer and less substantive. Appearances did not belie his
                        reputedly good personal relationship with <persName corresp="#p_BL_1"
                            >Brezhnev</persName>, but there was no evidence of <persName
                            corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> leaning heavily on <persName
                            corresp="#p_PNV_1">Podgorny</persName> for political support.</p>
                    <pb n="210" facs="0244" xml:id="pg_210"/>
                    <p>C. <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName> wears his Politburo hat as
                        if it had always been there, but continues to carry the burden of making
                        detailed presentations; <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>
                        often turned the floor over to him for that purpose. His ranking in the list
                        of suggested invitees for the Spaso dinner given to the Embassy by the
                            <gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss> Protocol Division was an anomaly:
                        after the top three, the order was Andropov, <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2"
                            >Gromyko</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Grechko</persName>,
                        followed by selected other Politburo members in alphabetical order. Thus
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName> was put out of
                        alphabetical order ahead of <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Grechko</persName>.
                        This might have been justified on the basis of his participation in the
                        talks, but in that case he should have gone ahead of Andropov as well. (As
                        it turned out, Andropov declined, which made it possible to seat <persName
                            corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName> at the head table.) <persName
                            corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName> is said by Soviets to have an
                        excellent personal relationship with <persName corresp="#p_BL_1"
                            >Brezhnev</persName>.</p>
                    <p>D. <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Grechko</persName>, who with <persName
                            corresp="#p_PNV_1">Podgorny</persName> and Shcherbitsky is reputed to be
                        among the group of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s
                        Ukrainian buddies, was the object of special attention from <persName
                            corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>, including an occasional friendly
                        arm around his shoulder and affectionate banter. On the whole, and contrary
                        to his public reputation, <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Grechko</persName>
                        comes through as a rather soft-spoken and even shy person. He displayed some
                        knowledge of English.</p>
                    <p>E. Kulakov was much in evidence at social functions, which may support the
                        belief that he is closely allied with <persName corresp="#p_BL_1"
                            >Brezhnev</persName> politically. He makes a good appearance and moved
                        easily, but did not seem particularly at ease in talking socially with
                        Americans. He steered clear of substantive discussions.</p>
                    <p>F. Andropov was a last minute dropout—“called away on business”—from the
                        Kremlin dinner, according to the Soviet protocol officer who had to find a
                        nonentity (an interpreter) to fill Andropov’s seat. His attendance along
                        with <persName corresp="#p_SMA_1">Suslov</persName> and others at a
                        competing function—a Lithuanian cultural evening—instead of the Spaso dinner
                        could have some political significance, but we are inclined to think that
                        assignments for the evening would have been collectively decided.</p>
                    <p>G. <persName corresp="#p_SMA_1">Suslov</persName> attended the Kremlin dinner
                        and the final reception but was noticeably aloof.</p>
                    <p>H. Shelepin attended both dinners and was noticeably convivial and congenial.

                        Soviet trade unionists. He does not give the appearance of being a political
                        heavyweight, but considering the decline in his fortunes compared to several
                        years ago he showed a lot of bounce.</p>
                    <p>9. Soviet preoccupation with China, apparent in the sudden despatch of border
                        negotiator Ilichev to Peking on the eve of the summit, also emerged in
                        social conversation with Politburo members.</p>

                    <p>A. Talking with the <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss>, <persName
                            corresp="#p_PNV_1">Podgorny</persName> predicted that the results of the
                        summit would be widely acclaimed. When Shelepin interjected “except by
                        China,” <persName corresp="#p_PNV_1">Podgorny</persName> went off on a five
                        minute tirade about China along familiar lines, accusing Peking of opposing
                        improved <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relations and
                        engendering anti-Soviet feelings in the rest of the world, especially in
                        Western Europe. But he said that in the final analysis, the Chinese will
                        fail in this effort.</p>
                    <p>B. <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Grechko</persName> also alluded to China at
                        the dinner table, noting that Soviet defense efforts must take account not
                        only of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> but also a third country
                        which has a 7000-kilometer border with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss>. Nobody could predict what that country might do; while
                        there is no direct threat at present, <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1"
                            >Grechko</persName> thought there could be an attack within five years.
                        He noted that by 1980 that country would have population of one billion.</p>
                    <p>10. Propaganda play of <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> themes during
                        and after the meetings included some expected puffery. A <hi rend="italic"
                            >Pravda</hi> commentary by Uri Zhukov, for example, stretched the
                        communiqué language to make it appear the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> had bought the Soviet position on a third-stage summit.
                        Apart from this minor mischief-making, Zhukov virtually admitted that
                        Soviet-Western differences over Basket Three make an autumn conclusion the
                        best that can be hoped for.</p>
                    <p>11. On the Middle East, the Soviet press has been somewhat defensive since
                        the summit. While the July 6 Politburo appraisal of the summit singled out
                        the <gloss target="#t_ME_1">ME</gloss> (along with <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1"
                            >CSCE</gloss>) as an international issue of prime importance, the
                        Soviets have not found the communiqué language particularly useful for
                        playback. They emphasized that they have not softened their insistence on a
                        full Israeli withdrawal nor their support for the rights of the
                        Palestinians. We expect that they will continue to cast themselves as
                        patrons of the Arab cause. They will probably focus more directly on the
                        Palestinian problem as a useful lever; the Arafat visit may be important in
                        this regard.</p>
                    <p>12. In sum, the third summit does not appear to have marked any major new
                        departures in Soviet thinking about either bilateral or international
                        issues, but may have laid the groundwork for further progress on some
                        important questions.</p>

                    <p>On June 7, <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> handed you a note
                        (Tab B) proposing bilateral negotiations to reach a coordinated <gloss

                        accordance with Article V of the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>. The
                        Soviets proposed that these talks take place a month or two before the

                    <p>This connection is in our interest. The Soviets will be more interested in
                        the “permissive” aspects of the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        problem—how to legitimize an active <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        program in the face of <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> constraints on
                        venting and nonproliferation concerns which have been exacerbated by India’s
                        nascent “<gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>” program. For our part, our
                        interests are mainly restrictive—to put conditions and curbs on <gloss

                        circumventing the <gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss>. Thus, by conducting
                        the two sets of talks in parallel, we can exert some leverage in gaining

                    </list>
                    <p>As a result of the interagency review of this subject in May, all agencies
                        except the <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> consider that <hi
                            rend="italic">some</hi> restraints on environmental warfare are in our
                        interest. The <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> prefer no restraints, but
                        consider the restraints recommended by <gloss target="#t_OSD_1">OSD</gloss>
                        below acceptable since they would do no serious damage to our military
                        posture.</p>
                    <p>All agencies also agree that there should be no restraints on using weather
                        modification techniques solely to protect forces from natural hazards and
                        fog modification to aid in search and rescue missions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_OSD_1">OSD</gloss> believes that we should prohibit the
                        use of “environmental warfare” defined as any military use of weather,
                        climate, ocean, or terrestrial modification techniques which could have
                        long-lasting, widespread, or especially severe effects. This would in effect
                        preclude all hostile uses except for tactical fog or precipitation
                        modification, which could prove useful in some situations if natural
                        meteorological conditions permitted. This choice would be verifiable within
                        reasonable limits of error and is considered acceptable by the <gloss
                            target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>State and <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> strongly believe that we
                        should prohibit not only those restraints recommended by <gloss
                            target="#t_OSD_1">OSD</gloss>
                        <hi rend="italic">but also</hi> restraints on precipitation and fog
                        modification for clearly hostile purposes. This is the only choice which
                        would constitute a “peaceful uses only” policy and meet with more general
                        acceptance as a definition of “environmental warfare.” However, tactical use
                        of fog and preciptation modification would be more difficult to verify than
                        the restraints recommended by <gloss target="#t_OSD_1">OSD</gloss>.</p>

                    <p>Following on this interagency examination and agreement that some restraints
                        are in our interest, you agreed at the summit in Moscow to advocate bringing
                        about the most effective measures possible against the dangers of using
                        environmental modification techniques for military purposes and to begin
                        discussions with the Soviets this year to explore the problem and what steps
                        might be taken to bring about effective restraints.</p>
                    <p>Pursuant to your decision set forth in the U.S./USSR Joint Communiqué and the
                        Joint Statement on Environmental Warfare, the draft <gloss
                            target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> at Tab A would instruct the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> Under Secretaries Committee to prepare a
                        scenario and approach for discussions with the Soviets to begin this
                        October. The <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> would <hi rend="italic"
                            >also</hi> reflect a decision that the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> approach to these exploratory discussions should be
                        consistent with the restraints supported by <gloss target="#t_OSD_1"
                            >OSD</gloss> and considered acceptable by the <gloss target="#t_JCS_1"
                            >JCS</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>This would not preclude discussions and perhaps a later <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> decision on broader restraints if the
                        Soviets raise them. Indeed, once we begin such discussions, particularly if
                        and when a multilateral agreement were desired, we will in all likelihood
                        have to address the question of a “peaceful uses only” policy or
                        prohibitions along the lines recommended by State and <gloss
                            target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss>. This prospect does not appear very
                        troublesome since the military case, including our operational rainmaking
                        experience in <gloss target="#t_SEA_1">SEA</gloss> from 1966–1972, for
                        preserving the option for hostile uses of fog and precipitation modification
                        techniques does not appear very strong.</p>
                    <p>There may well be some criticism by the Soviets or in any public airing of
                        our approach that we are not including in these discussions the only things
                        we know how to do and have done. Our use of rainmaking in <gloss
                            target="#t_SEA_1">SEA</gloss> has been controversial. That problem
                        should prove manageable, however, and I believe we should have a preference
                        in mind for discussions with the Soviets. The OSD/JCS preference would focus
                        on those restraints which would be subject to reasonable verification.</p>

                        signed during Moscow summit, when ratified, will ban underground nuclear

                        31, 1976. This treaty provides for separate agreement on nuclear explosions

                        been some international comment that this acknowledges a distinction between

                        agreement under <gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss> would be to ensure that

                        acquiring a device which could be used as a nuclear weapon.”</p>

                        nuclear weapon testing, verification of compliance with provisions of
                        Threshold Test Ban Treaty will be focused on specified test sites. Detailed
                        geological data on these sites, as well as the yields of a limited number of
                        actual explosions at the sites, will be exchanged in order to assist in
                        establishing calibrations for the yields and locations of weapon tests. To
                        prevent circumvention of <gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss>, it is
                        necessary to work out special arrangements to verify that nuclear explosions
                        by <gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss> parties outside test sites are
                        solely for peaceful purposes and are not used for testing weapons. Such
                        arrangements will have validity only for nuclear weapon states that have
                        reached advanced stage of nuclear explosion technology, since purpose will
                        be to make sure that advanced weapons development, which would normally
                        involve sophisticated designs and instruments, is not carried out in the
                        course of <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> projects. Similar
                        arrangements could not be applied to other states that are at beginning or
                        in early stages of nuclear technology since any nuclear explosions conducted
                        by such states will add to their nuclear weapons capability regardless of
                        motives or intentions of such explosions.</p>

                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>. Soviet press is engaged in a fairly
                        sizeable campaign on behalf of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1"
                            >Brezhnev</persName>’s July 21 proposals for denuclearization of the

                        August 16. And, in the weightiest commentary so far, “A. Platonov” sets out
                        the importance of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet agreement on a
                        comprehensive test ban. The Platonov piece appears to add nothing new to the
                        Soviet position; it may be intended mainly to serve notice on the new
                        American President that a complete ban on underground testing is high on the
                        list of Soviet arms control priorities. <hi rend="italic">End summary.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>2. “A. Platonov” is a pseudonym which in the past, we have suspected,
                        concealed the identity of the Soviet chief <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> negotiator, <persName corresp="#p_SVS_1">V.S.
                            Semenov</persName>. Platonov begins this time by tracing the history of
                        Soviet interest in a <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>, noting that it
                        was only the intractability of Western governments which prevented its being
                        achieved in 1963. He then pays homage to Soviet realism in accepting partial
                        measures, and launches into a description of the treaty on underground
                        testing achieved at the 1974 summit. Perhaps of special interest for the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s future negotiating positions is
                        the emphasis the writer puts on national technical means of
                        verification.</p>
                    <p>3. Platonov sees two major points of significance in the Threshold Test Ban
                        Treaty signed July 3. First, as a clear ban on the testing of powerful
                        nuclear devices it is important not just in the test ban field but also for
                        the limitation of strategic weaponry in general. Second, <pb n="219"
                            facs="0253" xml:id="pg_219"/>the treaty is an important measure leading
                        toward a complete test ban. It is this that the rest of the article is
                        about.</p>
                    <p>4. Platonov emphasizes the importance of a new comprehensive bilateral
                        agreement which would replace the current partial agreement. He quotes
                        liberally from <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s June 14 and
                        July 21 speeches on the Soviet position favoring such an agreement, and says
                        that world opinion—as well as some <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        lawmakers—share the same views. Because of the constructive Soviet position
                        on this, as well as the declared intention of the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> and Soviet Union to continue negotiations, “it can be
                        considered that the time will come when agreement on this problem too will
                        become possible.” Article closes with the assertion that it is important not
                        to close off possibility of peaceful uses of energy from underground
                        explosions and with a reference to Soviet-<gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> agreement to consider this question separately.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>. Platonov article does not seem to add
                        anything substantive to the Soviet position on a comprehensive test ban. It
                        continues to limit discussion of a complete underground ban to the bilateral
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss> context, with no reference to the other nuclear powers.
                        Conceivably Platonov’s reference (in two places) to bilateral agreement to
                        continue negotiations towards a comprehensive underground agreement may
                        foreshadow a Soviet initiative to get such talks moving, but he cites no
                        time frame and speaks with no special sense of urgency. Despite its
                        inference that only the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is really
                        interested in a comprehensive test ban, the article is not critical of the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> In addition to its usefulness as a
                        standard build-up for a Soviet position, it may be intended to focus the
                        test ban issue as a Soviet priority for the benefit of the new <gloss

                    <p rend="center">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</p>
                    <p>A. <hi rend="italic">In the 1980s, the production of nuclear weapons will be
                            within the technological and economic capabilities of many
                            countries.</hi> The once formidable barriers to development of nuclear
                        weapons by nations of middling size and resources have steadily diminished
                        over time. They will continue to shrink in the years ahead as plutonium,
                        enriched uranium, and technology become more widely spread. Some countries
                        will consider nuclear weapons largely in terms of military utility. <hi
                            rend="italic">The principal determinant of the extent of nuclear weapons
                            proliferation in coming years will, however, be political
                            considerations—including the policies of the superpowers with regard to
                            proliferation, the policies of suppliers of nuclear materials and
                            technology, and regional ambitions and tensions.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>B. <hi rend="italic">As things now stand, it is likely that India will
                            proceed to fabricate weapons covertly. But the <gloss target="#t_US_1"

                            might be able to dissuade them.</hi> The Indians probably would begin a
                        weapons program with the intent of keeping it small, but once launched on
                        that course pressures for an overt, substantial program—including
                        nuclear-capable aircraft, missiles or both—are likely to prove irresistible.

                        quantities of uranium, partly by clandestine means; the ambiguous nature of
                        Israeli efforts in the field of uranium enrichment; and Israel’s large
                        investment in a <pb n="221" facs="0255" xml:id="pg_221"/>costly missile
                        system designed to accommodate nuclear warheads. <hi rend="italic">We do not
                            expect the Israelis to provide confirmation of widespread suspicions of

                            of a grave threat to the nation’s existence.</hi> Future emphasis is
                        likely to be on improving weapon designs, manufacturing missiles more
                        capable in terms of distance and accuracy than the existing 260-mile
                        Jericho, and acquiring or perfecting weapons for aircraft delivery.</p>
                    <p>D. Several other countries—including West Germany, Sweden, Canada and
                        Italy—could have fabricated nuclear devices more easily, from a
                        technological and financial point of view, than India and Israel. They have
                        refrained, and they are unlikely to be much influenced by weapons
                        acquisition in countries like India. The inhibitions facing each of them are
                        strong. In all, popular opinion is strongly opposed to the acquisition of
                        nuclear weapons, both on emotional grounds and because such weapons would
                        entail substantial risks—of provoking attack, of offending vital allies and
                        of destroying existing mutual security arrangements. <hi rend="italic">It
                            would require very fundamental changes, such as the breakup of major
                            defense alliances accompanied by a substantial increase in strife and
                            tension throughout the world, to induce countries like West Germany,
                            Sweden, Canada and Italy to exercise their near-term
                        capability</hi>.</p>

                            Department of State, the Director, Defense Intelligence Agency, and the

                        believe that Japan’s situation is very similar to that of the other advanced
                        Western nations just mentioned. They <hi rend="italic">believe Japan would
                            not embark on a program of nuclear weapons development in the absence of
                            a major adverse shift in great power relationships which presented Japan
                            with a clearcut threat to its security. The Assistant Chief of Staff,
                            Intelligence, Department of the Air Force and the Director of Naval
                            Intelligence, Department of the Navy, however, see a strong chance that
                            Japan’s leaders will conclude that they must have nuclear weapons if
                            they are to achieve their national objectives in the developing Asian
                            power balance. Such a decision could come in the early 1980s.</hi> It
                        would likely be made even sooner if there is any further proliferation of
                        nuclear weapons, or global permissiveness regarding such activity. These
                        developments would hasten erosion of traditional Japanese opposition to a
                        nuclear weapons course and permit Tokyo to cross that threshold earlier in
                        the interests of national security. Any concurrent deterioration of Japanese
                        relations with the Communist powers or a further decline in the credibility
                        of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> defense guarantees would, in their
                        view, further accelerate the pace of nuclear weapons development by
                        Japan.</p>

                        />states, such as the Republic of China, Argentina and South Africa, will be
                        much influenced in their decisions not only by the general course of
                        proliferation but by such factors as growing feelings of isolation and
                        helplessness, perceptions of major military threat and desires for regional
                        prestige. In each of these cases, any weapons capability probably would be
                        small and delivery probably would depend on aircraft, though there is some
                        possibility that one or another might be able to purchase a nuclear-capable
                        missile system from a foreign supplier.</p>
                    <p>G. <hi rend="italic">Taipei conducts its small nuclear program with a weapon
                            option clearly in mind, and it will be in a position to fabricate a
                            nuclear device after five years or so.</hi> Taipei’s role in the world
                        is changing radically, and concern over the possibility of complete
                        isolation is mounting. Its decisions will be much influenced by <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policies in two key areas—support for the
                        island’s security and attitudes about the possibility of a nuclear-armed
                        Taiwan. <hi rend="italic">Taipei’s present course probably is leading it
                            toward development of nuclear weapons.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>H. <hi rend="italic">Argentina’s small nuclear program is being pursued
                            vigorously with an eye toward independence of foreign suppliers.</hi> It
                        probably will provide the basis for a nuclear weapons capability in the
                        early 1980s. Argentina has no apparent military need for nuclear weapons,
                        but there is strong desire for them in some quarters as a way to augment
                        Argentina’s power vis-à-vis Brazil. <hi rend="italic">Over time, in the
                            absence of strong international pressures that stop nuclear weapons
                            acquisition elsewhere, there is an even chance that Argentina will
                            choose to join the nuclear club in a small way.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>I. In the short run, South Africa is of more concern in the proliferation
                        context as a potential supplier of nuclear materials and technology than as
                        a potential nuclear weapons power. It controls large uranium deposits, and
                        it apparently has developed a technology for enriching uranium that could be
                        used for producing weapons-grade material. <hi rend="italic">South Africa
                            probably would go forward with a nuclear weapons program if it saw a
                            serious threat from African neighbors beginning to emerge. So serious a
                            threat is highly unlikely in the 1970s.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>J. <hi rend="italic">Other candidate countries—Spain, Iran, Egypt, Pakistan,
                            Brazil and South Korea—would need at least a decade to carry out a
                            nuclear weapons development program. One or another might detonate a
                            demonstrative device earlier—perhaps considerably earlier by using
                            purchased materials or by obtaining extensive foreign assistance.</hi>
                        Each of these countries is subject to a different set of motivations and
                        pressures. Some have enemies already making efforts in the nuclear weapons
                        field; all will be concerned with such efforts on the part of neighbors or
                        potential antagonists. Some will be interested in nuclear weapons for their
                        presumed prestige value. Unless countries opposed to
                        proliferation—particularly the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>—find ways to stop the spread of
                        nuclear weapons programs before these candidate countries are in a position
                        to go <pb n="223" facs="0257" xml:id="pg_223"/>forward, at least some of
                        them will be motivated to join the nuclear race. The strongest impulses will
                        probably be felt by Pakistan and Iran; Egypt and Brazil now appear to fall
                        into a second category of likelihood.</p>
                    <p>K. France, India and Israel, while unlikely to foster proliferation as a
                        matter of national policy, probably will prove susceptible to the lure of
                        the economic and political advantages to be gained from exporting materials,
                        technology and equipment relevant to nuclear weapons programs. And most
                        potential proliferators are on good terms with one or all of them.</p>
                    <p>L. It is theoretically possible for a country capable of developing a nuclear
                        weapon to do so covertly, up to the test of a first device. And a test is
                        not absolutely necessary. In practice, indications of such a program are
                        virtually certain to reach the outside world. But most countries will seek
                        to maintain the tightest possible security with regard to any military
                        nuclear activities, and information is likely to be intermittent and
                        inconclusive. Indigenous ballistic missile delivery systems, on the other
                        hand, would be readily identifiable early in the development cycle, and
                        missile systems obtained abroad would not remain undetected for any
                        significant period.</p>
                    <p>M. Governments backward in the nuclear field and anxious to acquire a token
                        capability quickly are more likely to try to steal weapons than fissionable
                        materials, despite the fact that the latter are less well protected. A
                        country capable of developing and producing its own nuclear device is highly
                        unlikely to try to steal weapons, but one might seek fissionable materials
                        by theft or diversion. Competently done, diversion might go undetected.</p>
                    <p>N. Terrorists might attempt theft of either weapons or fissionable materials.
                        They could see the latter as useful for terror or blackmail purposes even if
                        they had no intention of going on to fabricate weapons.</p>

                        inhibiting national decisions to acquire nuclear explosives. The proposed
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> approach ties in with three ongoing
                        international efforts: (1) measures to strengthen safeguards and export
                        controls; (2) discussions with India related to minimizing the adverse
                        consequences of her test; and (3) encouraging important <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> signatories and other key non-nuclear
                        weapon states to ratify the treaty soon. In addition to these efforts, a
                        successful nonproliferation strategy will be affected by perceptions of
                        non-nuclear weapon states regarding progress in <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss>-Soviet nuclear arms limitations as well as the confidence
                        of these states that their security and political needs can continue to be
                        met without recourse to independent nuclear forces.</p>
                    <p>As a device that might help to strengthen export controls and to coordinate
                        other multilateral nonproliferation efforts, the memorandum calls for an
                        international conference of key nuclear industrial states, provided
                        constructive French participation can be expected. To prepare such a
                        conference, we would use further bilateral consultations with the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> and Canada, and consultations with France
                        and other key states (<gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, <gloss

                            physical security standards. In addition, the Energy Coordinating Group
                            is working to develop multilateral policy guidelines and procedures
                            affecting uranium enrichment. [Footnote is in the original.]</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>A conference of nuclear industrial states offers an opportunity for realizing
                        a coordinated approach in placing effective controls, including safeguards
                        and security measures, over transfers of commercial nuclear equipment and
                        materials. In the context of both the conference and prior consultation,
                        countries such as Canada, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, and
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, which strongly support controls,
                        may convince other suppliers, notably France, to do the same. The advance
                        consultations, the conference itself, and any follow-up policies and
                        procedures that might be devised could also contribute to dealing with India
                        on non-proliferation questions.</p>
                    <p>To prepare the conference, we would approach the French and the Soviets to
                        ensure their support; it would be important to consult other key
                        participants following a positive reaction from France and the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. If the French indicate clear
                        opposition, it will be necessary to reformulate the proposed approach and
                        come back to you with further recommendations. Realistically, given the need
                        to complete interagency review as well as the necessary preparations and
                        prior consultations, it is unlikely that the conference could be held before
                        mid-November.</p>
                    <p>The major conference issue to be resolved is that of participation. Related
                        problems of polarization, the specific agenda and feasibility of substantive
                        results, and publicity tend to be tied to this question. (See Tab B for
                        further discussion.) Although many options could be constructed using a
                        variety of criteria, there are basically two approaches to
                        participation:</p>
                    <p>—a <hi rend="italic">restricted conference</hi> attended by the major current
                        nuclear suppliers, namely the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, France,
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, Japan, the <gloss
                            target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>,
                        and Canada;</p>
                    <pb n="226" facs="0260" xml:id="pg_226"/>
                    <p>—a <hi rend="italic">broader conference</hi> expanded to include other
                        nuclear industrial states, notably the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa,
                        Italy, Belgium, Switzerland, Spain, Australia, and India.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d72fn3">Criteria for participation in the restricted conference
                            seem relatively clear, since the seven nations designated are the most
                            significant potential nuclear suppliers. Selection in the case of a
                            broader conference is arbitrary. The above expanded list consists of the
                            ten nations judged to be next in potential as nuclear suppliers.
                            Particularly in the case of a larger conference, it should be recognized
                            that the Soviets may insist on greater representation of their allies,
                            thus creating pressure to further expand its size. We would inform the
                                <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> in advance of a conference and
                            welcome their attendance; they would be unlikely to accept an
                            invitation. The Memorandum to the President leaves open the question of
                            participation and can be forwarded for interagency review while these
                            alternative approaches and other conference issues are being considered
                            in greater depth by State and <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss>.
                            [Footnote is in the original.]</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">more restrictive</hi> approach would enhance both the
                        manageability of the conference and the prospects for reaching consensus
                        among the current major suppliers on an effective nuclear safeguards
                        strategy. The only country likely to present serious problems would be
                        France, although that nation would probably react more positively to a
                        proposal for a restricted conference than for an expanded one. Japan, on the
                        other hand, might not look with favor at participating in a small
                        cartel-like meeting. In such a conference we would have more flexibility in
                        terms of publicity; while the option of high-visibility could be chosen, a
                        smaller conference could be handled in a more low-profile manner, perhaps at
                        the Under Secretary level with strong technical participation by the various
                        delegations. If a restricted conference is held, we will need to deal with
                        potentially adverse reactions on the part of uninvited nuclear industrial
                        states as well as nuclear have-nots. A low profile could help alleviate the
                        polarization problem. Moreover, by excluding other nuclear industrial states
                        whose present export capabilities are limited, we could avoid the appearance
                        of isolating India, who would pose as a defender of the rights of the
                        nuclear have-nots and tend to take an unconstructive stance. The
                        non-participation of India would also facilitate agreement among the major
                        suppliers on dealing with India regarding <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNEs</gloss> and export controls.<note n="4" xml:id="d72fn4">Your
                            scheduled trip to India will probably take place before the conference.
                            This offers the opportunity for private talks with the Indians on
                            non-proliferation, in the context of a coordinated approach on the part
                            of Canada, the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>, and possibly the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> flowing from pre-conference
                            consultations. [Footnote is in the original.]</note> Some of the
                        political disadvantages of a restricted conference could be lessened if the
                        original members took the position that they viewed themselves as a nucleus
                        which might subsequently be enlarged. It might be understood that an item on
                        the agenda of the restricted conference would be “possible enlargement of
                        the consultations.”</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">broader approach</hi> would include from the start
                        other interested nuclear industrial states, and eliminate their concerns at
                        being <pb n="227" facs="0261" xml:id="pg_227"/>excluded. The inclusion of
                        Sweden, the Netherlands, and Australia would provide the conference the
                        benefit of three of the strongest supporters of non-proliferation. At the
                        same time, the broader approach would diminish the appearance of a
                        suppliers’ cartel. On the other hand, with a large conference, presumably at
                        a Foreign Minister level, adopting a low profile would become extremely
                        difficult. Some potential participants are less likely to publicly agree to
                        nuclear export restraint in such a conference than they are to actually
                        apply such measures in practice. Furthermore, many of the additional nations
                        are primarily nuclear importers in the near term (although all are <hi

                            situation here, of course, is different from the Energy Conference (when

                            suppliers and many recipients share a consensus on the problem.
                            [Footnote is in the original.]</note> and obtaining unanimity on
                        substantive issues would be difficult. In addition, it would be difficult to
                        draw the line for selection of participants once the conference were
                        expanded; for example, Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil would almost certainly
                        wish to attend, and the possibility of a twenty-odd nation conference could
                        not be dismissed. The inclusion of India would seem necessary in the widened
                        context; its exclusion in such circumstances might well provoke strong
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> opposition to the proposed
                        strategy. India would probably play a spoiling role and its presence would
                        seem to make export restraint agreements an unrealistic goal, and could
                        reduce prospects for gaining Indian cooperation in placing controls over its
                        nuclear exports.</p>

                        Their further comments and concurrence would be solicited within a week,

                    <p>A Senior Review Group meeting on this subject is scheduled for August 28.</p>
                    <p>Following on the interagency review in May of options regarding restraints on
                        environmental warfare, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                            >Nixon</persName> agreed at the summit in Moscow to advocate the most
                        effective possible restraints against using environmental modification
                        techniques for military purposes and to begin discussions with the Soviets
                        on the subject this year (see marked tab).<note n="2" xml:id="d73fn2">The
                            Soviets have not waited for the bilateral discussions but have moved to
                            seek a <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> General Assembly (<gloss
                                target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss>) resolution this fall which would
                            approve “the idea of concluding a broad agreement on the prohibition of
                            action to influence the environment and climate for military and other
                            purposes incompatible with the maintenance of international security,
                            human well-being and health” (see marked tab). This “broad-brush Soviet
                            initiative” gives us problems. Regardless of the decision on the issue
                            discussed herein, we will wish to ensure that any <gloss

                            subject to an appropriate body for further examination and is consistent
                            with the language agreed at the summit. Simply opposing the resolution
                            would appear contrary to our expressed interest in restraints as
                            affirmed at the summit and give the Soviets the lead in this area.

                    <p>As a result of the interagency review, all agencies except the <gloss

                        emerges at the meeting, your purpose is to confirm agency views and to reach

                    <p>To facilitate the near term decision on whether to give favorable
                        consideration to the Soviet suggestion that the July summit communiqué
                        include agreement to enter into discussions on prohibiting the use of
                        environmental modification techniques for military purposes, the interagency
                        report examined three options:</p>
                    <p>1. Accept no international restraints on military use of environmental
                        warfare, including weather, climate, ocean, and terrestrial modification
                        techniques. [Of these, there presently exists an operational or near
                        operational capability for only a few types of weather modification (for
                        example, fog and precipitation modification).]</p>
                    <p>2. Accept prohibitions on any military use of the above environmental
                        modification techniques having long-term, widespread, or especially severe
                        effects (essentially preserving tactical uses of fog and precipitation
                        modification for hostile purposes).</p>
                    <p>3. Accept prohibitions on all military use of such techniques for hostile
                        purposes.</p>
                    <p>None of the options would prohibit and no agency supports prohibiting weather
                        modification techniques solely to protect forces from natural hazards or fog
                        modification to aid in search and rescue missions.</p>

                        serious damage to our military posture.</p>
                    <p>This choice would (1) rule out the most dangerous and destructive
                        possibilities (most of which would have limited if any military application
                        should they ever come to be developed); (2) allay some of the domestic and
                        international concerns; (3) limit an area of possible arms competition; and
                        (4) be verifiable within reasonable limits of error.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, this choice would (1) be criticized internationally and
                        domestically as proposing to rule out everything except the things we know
                        how to do and have done (rainmaking in <gloss target="#t_SEA_1"

                        difficult politically to negotiate on a multilateral basis; and (3) possibly
                        hamper future development of international guidelines for civil
                        environmental modification efforts having cross-border effects since these
                        would probably proceed on a “peaceful purposes only” premise.</p>

                        Soviets and subsequent multilateral effort.</p>
                    <p>This choice would (1) meet with more general acceptance as a definition of
                        “environmental warfare” since all clearly hostile uses would be prohibited;
                        (2) be less ambiguous and perhaps the only basis on which we could expect
                        successful negotiations; and (3) enhance the development of international
                        guidelines for civil applications having cross-border effects since it would
                        constitute a “peaceful uses only pledge.”</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, this choice would (1) foreclose existing and prospective
                        weather modification options (fog and precipitation) which might be employed
                        to gain tactical advantage in some conflict situations (if natural
                        meteorological conditions permitted); and (2) present some verification
                        problems since tactical employment of weather modification techniques might
                        not be detectable.</p>

                        not to use environmental modification techniques for hostile purposes (see
                        Ikle memoranda at <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> tab). (We believe
                        that the desirability of working out international guidelines for civil
                        applications deserves further study with Commerce’s participation, but that
                        this aspect need not delay decision on the arms control question before
                        us.)</p>
                    <p>The fundamental difference between the agencies is not likely to change at
                        this meeting. <gloss target="#t_OSD_1">OSD</gloss> and the <gloss
                            target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> will wish to retain the right to use
                        precipitation and fog modification techniques for hostile purposes.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, your purpose in the meeting is to confirm agency views and to
                        reach agreement that the differences should be forwarded to the President
                        for decision. Your talking points at marked tab are structured
                        accordingly.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Our View.</hi> We believe that the military case,
                        including our operational rainmaking experience in <gloss target="#t_SEA_1"
                            >SEA</gloss>, for preserving the option for hostile uses of fog and
                        precipitation modification techniques is not very strong. However, <gloss
                            target="#t_OSD_1">OSD</gloss>’s position does focus on restraining those
                            <pb n="232" facs="0266" xml:id="pg_232"/>activities which could be
                        subject to reasonable verification, whereas tactical employment of fog and
                        precipitation modification might not be detectable.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, we recommend that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> should
                        structure its exploratory talks with the Soviets on the basis of a preferred
                        approach consistent with the position supported by <gloss target="#t_OSD_1"
                            >OSD</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss>. The draft
                        memorandum for the President (Tab 1) and draft <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1"
                            >NSDM</gloss> (Tab A) reflect this recommendation.</p>
                    <p>The draft <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> requests the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> Under Secretaries Committee to prepare an
                        appropriate scenario and approach for discussions with the Soviets and an
                        approach for dealing with the Soviet <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss>
                        proposal.</p>
                    <p>This would not preclude exploratory discussions and perhaps a later <gloss

                        Soviets raise them. Indeed, once we begin such discussions, particularly if
                        and when a multilateral agreement were desired, we will in all likelihood
                        have to address the question of a “peaceful uses only” policy or
                        prohibitions along the lines recommended by State and <gloss

                    <p>There may well be some criticism by the Soviets or in any public airing of
                        our approach that we are not including in these discussions the only things
                        we know how to do and have done. Our use of rainmaking in <gloss

                        should, however, prove manageable.</p>

                    <p>Following on the interagency examination in May of options regarding
                        restraints on environmental warfare, the President agreed at the summit in
                        Moscow to advocate such restraints and to begin U.S./USSR discussions this
                        year to explore the problem and what steps might be taken to bring about the
                        most effective measures possible against the dangers of using environmental

                    <p>As a result of the interagency review of this subject, all agencies except

                    <p>The interagency report examines the advantages and disadvantages of no
                        restraints on “environmental warfare,” and two different levels of
                        restraints which could be the bases for international discussions. For the
                        purposes of this study, the concept of environmental warfare could cover
                        weather, climate, ocean, terrestrial, and ionospheric modification for
                        military purposes.</p>

                        approval. The administration stated subsequently that it would not use
                        climate modification techniques for hostile purposes should they come to be
                        developed.</p>
                    <p>Under civilian authorization, military rain augmentation experiments and
                        operations were carried out in Southeast Asia from 1966 to 1972. These
                        represent our only significant operational experience in the military use of

                        weather modification activities includes forming, stabilizing, or
                        dissipating fog and low clouds; increasing or decreasing precipitation;
                        moderating, intensifying and steering of severe storms such as hurricanes
                        and typhoons; and suppressing or augmenting lightning and hail.</p>

                        and amount of precipitation can be considered operational or near
                        operational today. Positive but unsubstantiated assessments best describe
                        efforts in hurricane moderation and hail and lightning suppression. The idea
                        of intensifying or steering storms is mostly a theoretical possibility
                        only.</p>

                        programs are relatively small and are designed primarily for (1) protecting
                        personnel and resources against natural hazards to improve operational
                        capabilities and (2) guarding against technological surprise.</p>
                    <p>Possible militarily useful applications include:</p>
                    <p>—Rain enhancement could be used to wash out tactical bridging equipment,
                        disrupt airborne operations, channelize or block enemy attack or logistic
                        routes, or shield friendly activities.<note n="3" xml:id="d74fn3">The rain
                            augmentation activities in Southeast Asia were designed to make North
                            Vietnamese infiltration more difficult by increasing rainfall in
                            selected areas to soften road surfaces, cause landslides, and wash out
                            river crossings. These events normally occur during the height of the
                            rainy season. Seeding was intended to extend the period of occurrences
                            and to supplement the natural rainfall. While this program apparently
                            had an effect on the primitive road conditions in these areas, the
                            results were certainly limited and unquantifiable. [Footnote is in the

                    <p>—In limited circumstances, fog or low cloud stimulation or stabilization
                        might be useful; and fog dissipation could be used to facilitate launching
                        of air strikes or to clear target areas.</p>

                    <p>—Hurricane or typhoon intensification or steering, if ever feasible, might be
                        used for inflicting damage, denying areas for a limited time, or avoiding
                        storm damage.</p>
                    <p>However, militarily useful weather modification would require the conjunction
                        in place and time of a tactical opportunity to be gained by using
                        modification techniques, suitable meteorological conditions, and an
                        operational capability in place. While a deployed operational capability
                        could be made available with necessary investment, training, and doctrine,
                        the coincidence of the other two factors—suitable natural meteorological
                        conditions and tactical opportunity—would be fortuitous. For this reason,
                        weather modification would be essentially a “weapon of opportunity.”</p>

                        involve alteration of long-term climate (as contrasted with short-term

                    <p>There has been no extensive study of possible verification techniques for
                        restraints on use. Since many of the modification techniques are conceptual
                        in character, there is presently little basis for seeking to define
                        technical detection systems.</p>
                    <p>However, detection of weather modification efforts might be accomplished
                        through chance observations coupled with changes in weather conditions. The
                        chance of detecting separate, scattered events would be low except for fog
                        modification. The chance of identifying repetitive or large-scale seeding

                    <p>Efforts to carry out climate and ocean modifications or to trigger
                        earthquakes or generate tsunamis would probably be observable, although
                        identifying particular efforts as being related to modification purposes
                        might be difficult. Another important inhibition against such modification

                        thereby enhancing <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> participation in

                        which would provide for (1) a continuing program of studies under <gloss

                        modification for the benefit of mankind; (2) a commitment to study and work

                        believe that the desirability of working out international guidelines for
                        civil applications deserves further study with Commerce’s participation.
                        However, that aspect need not delay decision on the arms control question

                        <hi rend="italic">My View.</hi> The fundamental difference between the
                        agencies is that <gloss target="#t_OSD_1">OSD</gloss> and the <gloss
                            target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> wish to retain the right to use
                        precipitation and fog modification techniques for hostile purposes. The
                        military case, including our operational rainmaking experience in <gloss
                            target="#t_SEA_1">SEA</gloss>, for preserving these options for hostile
                        uses does not appear very strong.</p>
                    <p>However, the position favored by <gloss target="#t_OSD_1">OSD</gloss> focuses
                        on restraining those activities which would be subject to reasonable
                        verification, whereas tactical use of fog and precipitation modification
                        might not be detectable. Therefore, <hi rend="italic">we believe</hi> that
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> should structure its initial
                        exploratory talks with the Soviets on the basis of a preferred approach
                        consistent with the position supported by <gloss target="#t_OSD_1"
                            >OSD</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>This would not preclude exploratory discussions and perhaps a later <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> decision on broader restraints if the
                        Soviets raise them. In fact, we recognize that once we begin such
                        discussions, particularly if and when a multilateral agreement were desired,
                        we will in all likelihood have to address the question of a “peaceful uses
                        only” policy or prohibitions along the lines recommended by State and <gloss
                            target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss>. This prospect does not appear
                        particularly troublesome since, as noted above, the military case for
                        preserving fog and precipitation modification options does not appear very
                        strong.</p>
                    <p>It is also recognized that if we conduct the discussions initially on the
                        basis of the position supported by <gloss target="#t_OSD_1">OSD</gloss>,
                        there may well be some criticism by the Soviets or in any public airing of
                        the decision that we are not including in these discussions the only things
                        we know how <pb n="241" facs="0275" xml:id="pg_241"/>to do and have done.
                        Indeed, our use of rainmaking in Southeast Asia from 1966–1972 has been
                        controversial. However, this problem should prove manageable until such time
                        as we need address the question of broader restraints.</p>

                                long-term, widespread, or severe effects, and the acceptance of
                                prohibitions on all military use of such techniques for hostile
                                purposes.</p>

                        environmental modification techniques having long-term, widespread or
                        especially severe effects (Option 2); and (2) that we would accept
                        prohibitions on all military use of such techniques for hostile purposes
                        (Option 3).</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The subject of
                        today’s meeting is environmental warfare. I don’t think this will be a long
                        meeting. What I would like to do is clarify the major positions—see what
                        they are—and then get your judgment as to whether we can send them forward
                        to the President by memo for decision or whether we need an <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> meeting. My instincts are that we can
                        probably do it by memo, but I have no fixed opinion on that. <persName
                            corresp="#p_IFC_1">Fred</persName> (Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1"
                            >Iklé</persName>) would you like to sum up the situation?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: I guess I should start at
                        the latest development, the Soviet <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                        resolution, which calls for a broad agreement that would prohibit
                        influencing the environment and climate for military and any other purposes
                        incompatible with the maintenance of international security. This, of
                        course, came after our joint agreement at the Moscow Summit. Prior to the
                        Joint Communiqué, the interagency study came out with three basic options:
                        (1) that there would be no restraints on military use of environmental
                        warfare; (2) that there would be prohibitions on military use of
                        environmental modification techniques if they have long-term, widespread, or
                        especially severe effects; and (3) broad prohibitions against all military
                        use of such techniques. As I see it, there are only two issues we need to
                        discuss: (1) what are the various positions on the three options, and (2)
                        how should we handle the diplomatic part—the negotiations coming up in
                        October—and the Soviet’s <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolution.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’m less worried
                        about the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> than I am about how to handle
                        the bilateral negotiations with the Soviets. What I would like somebody to
                        explain to me is <gloss target="#t_OSD_1">OSD</gloss>’s position. Would it
                        be unfair to say that <gloss target="#t_OSD_1">OSD</gloss> would rule out
                        options one and three?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry</persName>, what bothers us—what is at issue
                        now—is that we have no idea of Soviet capabilities and intentions in this
                        field. We just don’t understand what their point is in wanting restraints on
                        environmental warfare.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, it seems
                        to me that it is this—that they want it all banned. I guess you could argue
                        that they are beginning to think about the consequences of no restraints on
                        such type of warfare and that they are sincerely concerned. You could argue
                        that they don’t <pb n="243" facs="0277" xml:id="pg_243"/>want an agreement.
                        But, the fact is that we are committed to bilateral negotiations on this
                        thing. What is it that <gloss target="#t_OSD_1">OSD</gloss> objects to in
                        Option Three? What is Option Two banning? How does Option One differ from
                        the others?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: Well, we feel that the
                        Soviet decision to have bilateral talks has really preempted Option One.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: This is true if
                        you preclude it as an outcome of negotiations. But, what I’d like to get
                        to—how is Option Two different from Option One?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: What Option Two does
                        is prohibit the use of such things as earthquakes and tidal waves—that type
                        of thing. Most of those things we’re talking about in Option Two we don’t
                        have the capability or technology to do anyway.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName>: We can create
                        earthquakes.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Not really. I
                        remember all that fuss about the underground explosion in the Aleutians.
                        Everybody thought that would create earthquakes, and it never happened.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">Miller</persName>: Basically, Option Two
                        would prohibit actions that would have long-term applications.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I know, but
                        that’s all double-talk. Just what sort of things would be prohibited under
                        Option Two?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName>: Things that we don’t
                        know much about right now. I mean, tidal waves and those sorts of things we
                        can’t do. We’re just speculating on things that we might be able to do in
                        the years to come.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Then we are
                        talking about things that we are not presently capable of doing.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName>: That’s right, except
                        for earthquakes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">Miller</persName>: And we can’t do that
                        unless the enemy moves onto the fault first!</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName>: Well, we really don’t
                        know what we can do yet.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Just for my own
                        education, is it possible to start an earthquake here and have it produce
                        results somewhere else? I mean, you can’t start an earthquake in Nevada and
                        send it to Siberia, can you?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: No, you can’t.</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_PJ_1">Pauly</persName>: The military utility of
                        such an action is questionable anyway.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: Earthquakes are
                        disruptive things, <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry</persName>. They
                        create a lot of havoc under the ground. They shear off oil drilling
                        equipment, pipes, that sort of thing. Besides, they have to occur where
                        there is a fault, like San Andreas.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Then you would
                        have to get close to create an earthquake, no?</p>
                    <pb n="244" facs="0278" xml:id="pg_244"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: That’s right, right on
                        the spot.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We’d have to do
                        it in Siberia then?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, in this
                        case, it seems a pity to me to ask for a bunch of studies just to have to
                        give them up later. How do we conduct the negotiations with the Russians?
                        How does <gloss target="#t_OSD_1">OSD</gloss> understand the options?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: Our problem is that we
                        don’t understand the Russian motivation for an agreement.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I can understand
                        their motivation. Number one, they probably wanted something to sign at the
                        Summit. Number two, their technology is behind ours in almost all fields.
                        They just might be worried about what we are doing and this would be a way
                        to find out. Number three, they might be on to something and they want to
                        prevent us from following them into it. Which of the three, I don’t know,
                        but I would think it would be one of the first two. That’s just a gut
                        feeling. Hal (Mr. Sonnenfeldt) what do you think?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sonnenfeldt: Well, first I think they are under some pressure to think
                        about twenty years from now. No more than us, they don’t want to spend
                        billions of dollars on projects that may have no application. I think they
                        must be doing some work of some kind on weather modification that we don’t
                        know about.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Clearly. Does
                        Option Three prevent everything?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName>: Only techniques
                        intended for hostile purposes.</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WVA_1">Walters</persName>: And that is difficult
                        to verify.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It seems to me
                        that in peacetime there is no difference between Options Two and Three. In
                        wartime, yes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: Yes, that’s right.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, whatever
                        options we present to the President for decision, the operational results
                        would not show up until there is a war, anyway. Research and development
                        could go forward.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName>: It’s impossible to
                        distinguish whether research and development are being used for peaceful
                        purposes or war in this circumstance.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: In the event of
                        a major war, I think we would have to reassess our position. I think they
                        would too. Would someone here write a negotiating scenario that we can give
                        the President. I think that Option One is excluded, we really have to decide
                        only between Option Two or Three. Option Three is easy, it prohibits
                        everything. Option Two centers on military uses that would not be
                        prohibited. What we need is clearer instructions for our delegation.</p>
                    <pb n="245" facs="0279" xml:id="pg_245"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: We can work up the
                        scenario.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Do we have a
                        working group? Let’s have the working group do this and have it in a couple
                        of days. Then I can move it on up to the President for decision. I’d like a
                        negotiating scenario to send along.</p>
                    <p>As I understand it, the <gloss target="#t_OSD_1">OSD</gloss> option prohibits
                        long-term uses of technical means to change the environment. The State and
                            <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> option would prohibit all hostile
                        uses. Both positions permit research and development. The practical
                        differences are really quite negligible.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Would you like to consider
                        the Russian <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolution in the
                        scenario?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Frankly, the
                        bilateral negotiations are being used as a device to block discussion of
                        this issue at the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>. We want to get that
                        into a <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> study group or something. So, we
                        really won’t face the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> problem. Okay,
                        thank you.</p>

                        tactical weapons. The primary concern today is possible use by the Soviet

                    <p>We do not know the size or location of Soviet stocks or production

                    <p>The Soviets could initiate use of chemical weapons in a conventional war,
                        despite an international legal obligation not to do so and even though their
                        military writings, doctrine, and exercises indicate that they usually
                        consider that any use of chemical weapons would take place in a nuclear
                        warfare environment. (The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military
                        doctrine considers chemical weapons of limited usefulness in terms of

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                    <p>We had a major interagency study in 1972–73 on possible <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> arms control options. The agency
                        disagreement then and now stems primarily from the question of what we want
                        or need for a <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> deterrent/retaliatory
                        capability, or specifically, whether or not we should pursue the production
                        and stockpiling of binary chemical weapons to replace a major portion of our
                        current <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> stocks.</p>
                    <p>The binary issue has come to a head as Army development has reached the stage
                        for a production decision on artillery shells. This issue has been somewhat
                        diffused by recent congressional action on <gloss target="#t_OSD_1"
                            >OSD</gloss>’s <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 75 budget request of
                        $5.8 million to establish one binary production facility at Pine Bluff
                        Arsenal, Arkansas. Defense agreed with us that the funds would not be spent
                        pending the President’s decision on binary production, but wished to seek
                        congressional approval for this long lead-time facility. After being
                        favorably reported out of committee, this $5.8 million request was knocked
                        out on the floor of the House on August 7 by a vote of 218 to 186.</p>
                    <p>We still need a decision on binaries in order (1) to provide guidance for
                        Defense’s planning, and (2) to help determine the more immediate question of
                        what our position should be on the question of <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss> restraints. How the decision on binary production will
                        affect our options regarding <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> limitations
                        is detailed in the <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> posture alternatives

                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> limitations have been the major subject
                        at the Geneva Conference of the Committee on Disarmament (<gloss
                            target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss>) for three years. The Soviets have
                        privately and publicly pressed hard for <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        action on <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> negotiations and have generally
                        supported a ban on the development, production, and stockpiling of <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> relying essentially on national means for
                        “verification.”</p>
                    <p>Our position has been that meaningful negotiations on chemical weapons cannot
                        begin until such problems as reasonable verification have been worked out.
                        We have presented several detailed working papers for <gloss
                            target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> discussion on verification problems.</p>
                    <p>The 1974 U.S./USSR summit communiqué indicated agreement to consider a joint
                        initiative in the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> with respect to the
                        conclusion of an international convention dealing with the most dangerous,
                        lethal means of chemical warfare. [The 1972 and 1973 U.S./USSR summit
                        communiqués indicate we will work toward further <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss> limitations.] The Soviets wish to begin consultations soon.
                        They have given us a draft proposal which gives us serious problems mainly
                        because it envisages the destruction of existing lethal <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> stocks and reliance on national means of

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Advantages</p>
                    <p>—The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would retain its existing <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> capability (although limited) to deter the
                        use of <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> against <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> forces and, if deterrence fails, to retaliate in kind.</p>
                    <p>—This would be a less controversial and provocative posture, domestically and
                        internationally, than any other alternative (although any filling actions to
                        compensate for phase-out of some delivery systems later would be
                        controversial).</p>
                    <p>—This would be consistent with our declared commitment to seek effective
                        measures to control <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>, and could provide
                        more flexibility for arms control negotiations than the other alternatives
                        if a ban on production of <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> agents were
                        desired.</p>
                    <p>—This would be less likely than Alternative 1 to encourage either an increase
                        in the Soviet <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> capability or any further
                        proliferation of <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> capabilities.</p>

                    <p>—This would cost much less than Alternatives 1 or 3 (only somewhat less if
                        filling actions were undertaken later) and substantially less than the
                        following alternative.</p>

                    <p>—To maintain the existing filled munitions capability would require some

                        which would undoubtedly be controversial in Congress and <gloss

                    <p>We have been carrying on technical talks for some years with the Soviets and
                        others regarding the benefits of peaceful nuclear explosions (<gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>) for excavation purposes and the
                        possibilities for limiting the radioactive fallout to acceptably low levels.
                        Such excavation shots are almost all prohibited by the <gloss
                            target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>. The outcome of these talks would supply
                        the technical background for a possible future initiative to open the <gloss
                            target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> to amendment to allow de minimus
                        radioactivity levels to cross borders for legitimate <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> applications as long as no health risk
                        exists. Our own <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> program is practically
                        nonexistent and not constrained by the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1"
                            >LTBT</gloss> prohibition, but the Soviets have many excavation shots
                        planned and are most interested in amending the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1"
                            >LTBT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The political aspects of seeking to amend the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1"
                            >LTBT</gloss> have not been the subject of any explicit interagency
                        study, and no administration policy exists.</p>
                    <p>Our preparatory work for the negotiation of the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> agreement collateral to the <gloss target="#t_TTB_1"

                        conference could be more comprehensive and useful, if some policy
                        understanding could be reached on the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>
                        matter. In particular, the handling of excavation <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> above the threshold will be one of the major focuses of the
                        October Moscow talks, and Soviet willingness to be forthcoming on
                        verification procedures (including establishing the precedent of on-site
                        inspection) may well depend in part on our position on the <gloss
                            target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> amendment question. It is even
                        conceivable that some indication of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        support <pb n="257" facs="0291" xml:id="pg_257"/>for <gloss
                            target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> amendment will be necessary to the
                        successful conclusion of the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> agreement.
                        However, there are several disadvantages to seeking to amend the <gloss
                            target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>, the most important being that the
                        majority of the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> Parties may well
                        demand a <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> as a quid pro quo for amending
                        the treaty to allow excavation <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>, and we
                        may, in any event, fail to gain international approval for the amendment by
                        raising it at this time. Further, Congress may defeat ratification of <hi
                            rend="italic">both</hi> an <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>
                        amendment and the TTBT if the two issues are coupled directly or implicitly.
                        (Further analysis of the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> issues and
                        the pros and cons are at Tab B).</p>
                    <p>It would be useful to conduct a quick interagency assessment of the
                        non-technical issues associated with amendment of the <gloss
                            target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>. Based on this study, the President
                        would have the background for deciding whether the amendment liabilities
                        appear too great to indicate any <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        movement at this time or, conversely, that we can use some indication of
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> support to gain important
                        concessions from the Soviets in the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        talks. (Any action to seek amendment of the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1"
                            >LTBT</gloss> would, of course, be predicated on technical agreement on
                        reducing radioactive release and standards of acceptable dose so that risk
                        to health would not be an issue.)</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Introduction</p>
                    <p>In order to have a criterion against which compliance can be measured, as
                        well as for reasons of world health, the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1"
                            >LTBT</gloss> states its prohibition against venting explosions as a
                        requirement that no radioactive debris from a nuclear explosion should cross
                        the testing nation’s border. An ancillary effect of this proscription has
                        been to preclude most excavation <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>.
                        Mainly because of Soviet interest in conducting such shots, there has been a
                        debate over several years as to the wisdom of amending (or reinterpreting)
                        the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> to allow de minimus radioactivity
                        levels to cross borders for legitimate <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        applications as long as no health risk exists. Since the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has had little interest in excavation
                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>, no policy toward an amendment of
                        the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> has been formulated—instead we
                        have (at an unhurried pace) conducted technical assessments of the benefits
                        of excavation <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> and the possibility of
                        limiting fallout to low levels, and continued a technical dialogue with the
                        Soviets and others on these subjects. The next bilateral talks are this
                        November, and multilateral discussions are planned for next January.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The possibility of limiting radioactive fallout from excavation <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> to a low level seems good. The use of
                        small fission triggers, appropriate burial depths, and cloud steering by
                        winds aloft could reduce the dose received by those in neighboring countries
                        to a few percent of international standards for acceptable exposure and the
                        long-term global dose to very low values compared to the natural background.
                        Although a verification system could, in principle, be devised to insure
                        that such events were not clandestine weapons effects tests, there may be
                        very difficult practical problems to achieving adequate verification.</p>
                    <p>The necessary amendment of <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> to allow
                        excavation <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> would change the present
                        statement that radioactive debris cannot be <pb n="259" facs="0293"

                        State, to state instead that venting nuclear explosions must be for peaceful
                        purposes and the radioactive release should be as small as technically
                        feasible and represent no danger to human health (as defined by acceptable
                        dose standards).</p>
                    <p>Successful amendment or “reinterpretation” of the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1"
                            >LTBT</gloss> requires approval by a majority of the parties (over 100)

                            >USSR</gloss>). Our approval of an amendment would require Senate

                    <p>The Soviets have urged us informally to propose an amendment but have not

                    </p>
                    <p>On the assumption that the technical issues can be satisfactorily resolved,
                        there are several other considerations that should be weighed in determining
                        a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy toward possible amendment of
                        the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>1. Our domestic <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> endeavor is a modest
                            <gloss target="#t_RD_1">R&amp;D</gloss> program, but were we to see
                        advantage to an enhanced effort with new applications for ourselves or for
                        others, the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> could constrain some of
                        our projects and amendment of the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>
                        would serve our purposes.</p>
                    <p>2. Article V of the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> requires that if
                        practical applications of <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> are
                        developed by nuclear weapons States, such applications must be made
                        available to all Parties on a nondiscriminatory basis. Although never tested
                        by any persistent pursuit of such assistance by a non-nuclear weapon State
                            (<gloss target="#t_NNWS_1">NNWS</gloss>), we could be faced in the
                        future with a legitimate request for <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        services. While we have no obligation to provide <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> services if we have not developed the particular
                        application for ourselves, our unwillingness to provide <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> services if requested could be seen as a
                        failure of Article V of the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>, and could
                        lend impetus and some legitimacy to indigenous development of <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> by <gloss target="#t_NNWS_1"
                        >NNWS</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>To avoid the risk of stimulating <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        development, and to serve our other nonproliferation objectives, we may want
                        to provide <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> services. Since the current
                        foreign interest while limited is predominantly in the excavation area, it
                        would be inconsistent to refuse to agree to amend the <gloss

                    <p>3. In trying to negotiate the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> agreement
                        collateral to the <gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss> with the <gloss

                        appropriate verification safeguards. It may be difficult for us successfully
                        to conclude such negotiations sui generis, since the Soviets may well want
                        to link all relevant agreements on excavation <pb n="260" facs="0294"

                        <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>’s in the negotiations, particularly the
                        amendment of the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>. Moreover,
                        willingness on our part to consider the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1"
                            >LTBT</gloss> question favorably may be a useful negotiating tool in
                        obtaining agreement to the observation and verification procedures we
                        consider necessary to enforce the <gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss> as
                        well as to establish the precedent of on-site inspection.</p>
                    <p>The disadvantages of attempting to amend the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1"
                            >LTBT</gloss> are several:</p>
                    <p>1. The importance and influence of this international agreement, which
                        represented a turning point in global nuclear relations, can only be
                        diminished if it is altered in order to allow one of the activities it was
                        established to prevent: the spread of radioactivity.</p>
                    <p>2. It is very questionable that we would succeed in gaining the approval of a
                        majority of the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> parties for an
                        amendment. There is no benefit for most of the States and many may withhold
                        approval as a demonstration of displeasure with the limited nature of the
                            <gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss>, or conversely, seek a commitment
                        to a <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> as the quid pro quo for supporting
                        the amendment of the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> to allow
                        excavation <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>. Opposition arguments would
                        note that health risks might be small but would be borne by all whereas the
                        benefits derived from the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> would accrue
                        to few; that there would be a finite number of premature deaths and birth
                        defects from radioactive release; and that limits stated only in terms of
                        acceptable human dose opens the door to increasing the radioactive burden in
                        the atmosphere and the oceans.</p>
                    <p>3. Congressional ratification is questionable, and if a relationship is
                        perceived between the necessity to amend the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1"
                            >LTBT</gloss> and the successful negotiation of the TTBT, both may be
                        defeated. Using “reinterpretation” rather than amendment to avoid
                        congressional ratification probably is too costly politically.</p>
                    <p>4. A substantial campaign to defeat ratification can be expected by
                        environmentalists, who may also succeed in requiring governmental submission
                        of an environmental impact statement which is then subject to protracted
                        court tests.</p>
                    <p>5. Our foreseeable interest in <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> is
                        minimal. At present our only motivation to amend the <gloss
                            target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> is to accommodate the Soviets. The cost
                        of this action to us may not be commensurate with the value we might
                        receive.</p>
                    <p>6. By legitimizing venting, we may remove the technical obstacle of
                        underground testing from an <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> adherent
                        considering development of nuclear explosives.</p>
                    <p>7. The <gloss target="#t_AEC_1">AEC</gloss> enforces de facto radiation
                        standards more stringent than the international standards, and the
                        practicable levels proposed for an <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>
                        amendment may, therefore, not leave an acceptable margin of safety compared
                        to our own standards.</p>

                    <p>The President has directed that the issues associated with a shift to private
                        ownership of part of our future uranium enrichment capacity be reexamined.
                        The study should consider but not be limited to the following:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>What is the outlook for private sector assumption of the enrichment
                            business with present and prospective technologies?</p>
                        <p>What are the prospects for adequate production resources being developed
                            to meet the long-term projected increasing demand for uranium enrichment
                            facilities?</p>
                        <p>What governmental actions (and associated costs) would be required to
                            facilitate private entry and to ensure future supply?</p>
                        <p>What would be the implications of private control of enrichment for
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> foreign policy, trade and
                            energy policies, domestic and international nuclear safeguards, and
                            nonproliferation?</p>
                        <p>What are the costs and implications of the <gloss target="#t_US_1"

                            assurance of timely availability, and nondiscriminatory access? How can
                            it be ensured that the private sector would meet and sustain such
                            commitments, and what would be the foreign policy implications if these
                            commitments were not met?</p>
                        <p>What are the prospects and implications (for example, for trade benefits
                            and proliferation) if private activity were to result in business
                            arrangements abroad through which enriching technology becomes subject
                            to transfer, sale or licensing?</p>

                            adequate mechanisms developed to facilitate the planning and long-range
                            actions necessary to maintain the appropriate <gloss target="#t_US_1"

                        <p>What are the organizational alternatives to private assumption of
                            enriching services? (Each alternative should include discussion of its
                            legislative, cost, and budget implications, probable congressional and
                            utility reaction, and impact on the nuclear industry.)</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>Based on the above analysis and other relevant factors, the study should

                    <p>The questions below could be explored with the Soviet Union regardless of a
                        specific decision between Option 2 or Option 3.</p>
                    <p>1. Is there a satisfactory conceptual approach for defining the subject
                        matter of “environmental warfare” and for differentiating measures concerned
                        with this matter from other arms control problems (such as the use of
                        herbicides), from the environmental effects of weapons, and from other
                        “environmental” problems?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> side</hi> could
                        note that all military activities have ancillary environmental effects and
                        that in some cases the environmental impact is direct and intentional. The
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> side could point out that there is
                        a distinction between the foregoing cases and the concept of “environmental
                        warfare” in that the latter would not only affect various environments but
                        also represent an effort to release or manipulate natural environmental
                        processes or forces for the purposes of destruction or disruption. It could
                        be noted that for the most part specific techniques <pb n="264" facs="0298"
                            xml:id="pg_264"/>have not been demonstrated; consequently, constraining
                        measures would have to deal with currently unknown techniques which might
                        emerge in time.</p>
                    <p>2. What environmental fields, in addition to climate modification, would
                        comprise the focus of measures to overcome the dangers of military uses?</p>

                        note the possibility of considering measures concerned with techniques (in

                        oceans, and the physical processes of the earth’s interior—in addition to
                        measures concerned with climate modification techniques which might emerge
                        in the future.<note n="4" xml:id="d80fn4">

                            arms control since it could stimulate military interest where there is
                            none today and stir up concern among third parties. [Footnote is in the

                        refrain from including within the scope of possible measures the use of

                        modification techniques for search and rescue missions (including missions
                        in enemy territory). In this regard, the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> side could note that measures should be concerned with

                        <hi rend="italic">The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> side</hi> would

                        could point out the intrinsically dual (civil or military) applicability of
                        research on environmental modification and the impracticability of verifying
                        a prohibition of military research and development.</p>
                    <p>4. What would be the prospect of verifying measures constraining military
                        uses of environmental modification techniques?</p>

                    <p>As directed, the Under Secretaries Committee has prepared the enclosed report
                        concerning “Modification of the Limited Test Ban Treaty to Allow Peaceful
                        Nuclear Explosions for Excavation Projects.”</p>
                    <p>The questions examined in this report are related to two other matters
                        currently under consideration: negotiation with the Soviet Union of the
                        agreement on peaceful nuclear explosions (<gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNEs</gloss>) contemplated by the Threshold Test Ban Treaty, and our
                        strategy concerning nonproliferation of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>The report presents three alternatives for consideration:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>—to agree to consider modification of the Limited Test Ban Treaty;</p>
                        <p>—to reject modification; or</p>
                        <p>—to adopt a neutral position but refrain from objecting if the Soviets
                            desire to seek formal amendment of the treaty.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>The Arms Control and Disarmament Agency favors the second of these
                        alternatives. The Arms Control and Disarmament Agency believes that an
                        amendment to the Limited Test Ban Treaty would not be in our interest, that
                        it would not be approved by the Senate, and that we should not lead the
                        Soviet Union to believe we would be prepared to support such an
                        amendment.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_AEC_1">AEC</gloss> favors attempting to separate the
                        question of Limited Test Ban Treaty modification from the <gloss

                    <p>As the first major arms control measure achieved following the Second World
                        War, the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> remains a benchmark in the
                        history of efforts to deal with the major security questions raised by the
                        development of nuclear weapons. Originally negotiated and signed by the

                        marked one of the initial steps in political efforts to improve East-West
                        relations. From this standpoint, it was a forerunner of present efforts to
                        achieve détente.</p>
                    <p>From the outset, it was recognized that the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1"
                            >LTBT</gloss> would not prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, but it
                        was envisaged that the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> would serve
                        our interest in nonproliferation. A number of countries—including India,

                            (<gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>). While India’s nuclear test
                        confirms the limitations of the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> in

                        countries which would otherwise be subject to no agreed restraints.</p>
                    <p>The fact that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and Soviet Union had
                        halted atmospheric testing facilitated the subsequent conclusion of the

                        which has been—and continues to be—considered an “unequal treaty” by a

                    <p>When the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> was signed, there was
                        substantial public concern here and abroad about the effects of radioactive

                        to that situation and remains important at a time when concern about many

                        the following factors would influence the attitudes of other parties:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>—Even if technically satisfactory radiation criteria could be developed,
                            countries emotionally opposed to atmospheric nuclear weapons tests might
                            well oppose permitting <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> excavation
                            projects (we have no basis for judging whether such attitudes would be
                            altered if the prospective number of such projects were limited).</p>
                        <p>—On the whole, the likelihood of acceptability would be substantially
                            less if only one or a few countries were considered the beneficiaries of
                            a change than if a number of countries, including developing countries,
                            were viewed as potential beneficiaries. While several countries have

                            projects, we have no measure of the seriousness of this interest, and no

                    <p>As noted above in considering various approaches to modification, the Senate

                    <p>As to the substance of the issue, the following generalizations appear
                        relevant:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>—A proposed modification believed likely to weaken essential purposes of
                            the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> (as regards testing of
                            nuclear weapons, limitation of radiation hazards, and nonproliferation)
                            would not be accepted.</p>
                        <p>—A proposed modification believed to be of greater benefit to the Soviet
                            Union than the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would also probably
                            not be accepted unless “benefits” for the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> were viewed in terms broader than <gloss

                        <p>—A proposed modification justified on the basis of nonproliferation
                            objectives (for example, meeting Art. V obligations) might have a better
                            chance of being accepted than a modification proposed as an important
                            component of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relations.
                            However, such a justification would be subject to substantial
                            skepticism.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>The foregoing generalizations do not seek to take into account the effects of
                        pressures from domestic environmental groups, arms control groups, or
                        anti-détente groups.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Environmental Legislation</p>
                    <p>The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (<gloss target="#t_NEPA_1"
                            >NEPA</gloss>) requires that an environmental impact statement be
                        prepared prior to any “major federal action significantly affecting the
                        quality of the human environment.” Such statements must analyze in detail
                        the potential environmental effects of the proposed action and of all
                        reasonable alternatives. In the past, failures to comply with the Act have
                        often resulted in the granting of injunctions by federal courts against
                        carrying out the federal actions in question.</p>
                    <p>The procedures of the Act have been applied to the negotiation and conclusion
                        of a number of international agreements, and several impact statements have
                        been prepared by federal agencies in connection with international
                        negotiations, primarily those involving agree<pb n="279" facs="0313"
                            xml:id="pg_279"/>ments on environmental standards. No real question has
                        been raised under <gloss target="#t_NEPA_1">NEPA</gloss> on any arms control
                        negotiation since the passage of the Act, presumably because of the very
                        inchoate and indirect relationship of those negotiations to the
                        environment.</p>
                    <p>However, there would undoubtedly be great interest among public environmental
                        groups in any proposal to modify the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>,
                        in effect, to establish new minimum permissible levels of radioactive
                        discharge outside a country’s territorial borders for nuclear excavation
                        projects and there might be great public and congressional pressure to
                        produce an environmental impact statement on the subject. This might, for
                        example, involve the preparation of a draft statement prior to the final
                        stage of any negotiations and a revised final statement prior to submission
                        of the resulting agreement or amendment to the Senate.</p>
                    <p>Environmental groups might attempt to resort to the courts on any disputes in
                        this area.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Major Options</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, because the problem
                        now is that each country sells reactors competitively.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: On this, nonproliferation
                        is a problem that is as important as it was ten years ago.</p>
                    <p>The President: Maybe so.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: Two-thirds of the states
                        have ratified it, but the remainder haven’t. It would be good if we two did
                        our best to get more states to ratify.</p>
                    <p>The President: I hope we could work effectively on this. I’m interested,
                        Congress is, and if we could stabilize this . . .</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: These are two points. One
                        is the spread of reactor technology. Maybe we can do something on this. The
                        other is, the Foreign Minister wouldn’t want some of his allies to get the
                        impression of condominium.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: If you mean our real allies
                        [smile], it is no problem. No one can predict how someone might act
                        irresponsibly.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Speaking frankly, France
                        has sold four reactors to Iran and we don’t know what safeguards there were.
                        If we two can agree on safeguards, then we could go to the Europeans.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName>: Do you have sufficient
                        safeguards?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: In the Egyptian case, we
                        have, we think, foolproof safeguards. If we two can agree and if we get the
                        Europeans to agree, we can control the situation. We will tell you our
                        safeguards—maybe you have better ones.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: Sometimes Japan and Brazil
                        are mentioned. What do you think?</p>
                    <p>The President: Japan has its own problems . . .</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The line between weapons
                        and peaceful uses is vague. The Indian explosion obviously has military
                        implication. The Japanese have a big nuclear program but have not done any
                        explosion yet. If they moved this way, they would go like India and could be
                        a big power very quickly.</p>

                    <p>On September 23, 1974, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry
                            Kissinger</persName> delivered an address entitled “An Age of
                        Interdependence: Common Disaster or Community” before the United Nations
                        General Assembly in New York. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> referenced his 1973 address before the General
                        Assembly, noting that he had “asked other nations to join us in moving the
                        world from détente to cooperation, from coexistence to community.” Since
                        then, he continued, progress had been made in resolving various global
                        problems; however, several fundamental issues persisted, and new problems
                        had emerged. According to <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>,
                        the question remained as to whether the global community’s vision would
                        “keep pace” with these challenges: “New realities have not yet overcome old
                        patterns of thought and action. Traditional concepts—of national
                        sovereignty, social struggle, and the relation between the old and the new
                        nations—too often guide our course. And so we have managed but not advanced;
                        we have endured but not prospered; and we have continued the luxury of
                        political contention.” Common interest in preventing local conflicts,
                        limiting the spread of nuclear weapons, and increasing the economic
                        viability of all nations would allow leaders to “remedy problems,” rather
                        than simply responding to crises.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> devoted the first portion
                        of his address to discussing regional conflicts before turning to arms
                        control. He outlined not only the threats nuclear proliferation posed to
                        world stability but also the efforts undertaken by the United States and
                        other nations to limit strategic arms, establish nuclear safeguards, and
                        promote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy:</p>
                    <p>“The world has grown so accustomed to the existence of nuclear weapons that
                        it assumes they will never be used. But today, technology is rapidly
                        expanding the number of nuclear weapons in the hands of major powers and
                        threatens to put nuclear-explosive technology at the disposal of an
                        increasing number of other countries.</p>
                    <p>“In a world where many nations possess nuclear weapons, dangers would be
                        vastly compounded. It would be infinitely more difficult, if not impossible,
                        to maintain stability among a large number of nuclear powers. Local wars
                        would take on a new dimension. Nuclear weapons would be introduced into
                        regions where political conflict remains intense and the parties consider
                        their vital interests overwhelmingly involved. There would, as well, be a
                        vastly heightened risk of direct involvement of the major nuclear
                        powers.</p>
                    <p>“This problem does not concern one country, one region, or one bloc alone. No
                        nation can be indifferent to the spread of nuclear technology; every
                        nation’s security is directly affected.</p>
                    <pb n="285" facs="0319" xml:id="pg_285"/>
                    <p>“The challenge before the world is to realize the peaceful benefits of
                        nuclear technology without contributing to the growth of nuclear weapons or
                        to the number of states possessing them.</p>
                    <p>“As a major nuclear power, the United States recognizes its special
                        responsibility. We realize that we cannot expect others to show restraint if
                        we do not ourselves practice restraint. Together with the Soviet Union we
                        are seeking to negotiate new quantitative and qualitative limitations on
                        strategic arms. Last week our delegations reconvened in Geneva, and we
                        intend to pursue these negotiations with the seriousness of purpose they
                        deserve. The United States has no higher priority than controlling and
                        reducing the levels of nuclear arms.</p>
                    <p>“Beyond the relations of the nuclear powers to each other lies the need to
                        curb the spread of nuclear explosives. We must take into account that
                        plutonium is an essential ingredient of nuclear explosives and that in the
                        immediate future the amount of plutonium generated by peaceful nuclear
                        reactions will be multiplied many times. Heretofore the United States and a
                        number of other countries have widely supplied nuclear fuels and other
                        nuclear materials in order to promote the use of nuclear energy for peaceful
                        purposes. This policy cannot continue if it leads to the proliferation of
                        nuclear explosives. Sales of these materials can no longer be treated by
                        anyone as a purely commercial competitive enterprise.</p>
                    <p>“The world community therefore must work urgently toward a system of
                        effective international safeguards against the diversion of plutonium or its
                        byproducts. The United States is prepared to join with others in a
                        comprehensive effort.</p>
                    <p>“Let us together agree on the practical steps which must be taken to assure
                        the benefits of nuclear energy free of its terrors:</p>
                    <p>“—The United States will shortly offer specific proposals to strengthen
                        safeguards to the other principal supplier countries.</p>
                    <p>“—We shall intensify our efforts to gain the broadest possible acceptance of
                        International Atomic Energy Agency (<gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>)
                        safeguards, to establish practical controls on the transfer of nuclear
                        materials, and to insure the effectiveness of these procedures.</p>
                    <p>“—The United States will urge the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> to
                        draft an international convention for enhancing physical security against
                        theft or diversion of nuclear material. Such a convention should set forth
                        specific standards and techniques for protecting materials while in use,
                        storage, and transfer.</p>
                    <p>“—The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which this Assembly
                        has endorsed, warrants continuing support. The treaty contains not only a
                        broad commitment to limit the spread of nuclear explosives but specific
                        obligations to accept and implement <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>
                        safeguards and to control the transfer of nuclear materials.</p>

                    <p>“Mr. President, whatever advantages seem to accrue from the acquisition of
                        nuclear-explosive technology will prove to be ephemeral. When Pandora’s box
                        has been opened, no country will be the beneficiary and all mankind will
                        have lost. This is not inevitable. If we act decisively now, we can still
                        control the future.” (Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin,</hi>

                    <p>For a variety of verification, military, nonproliferation, and anti-<gloss
                            target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss> reasons, <hi rend="italic">there is a
                            fairly solid bureaucratic consensus against allowing <gloss

                    <p>The principal basis for discussion at the meeting is an Issues Paper (Tab B)
                        prepared by the Verification Panel working group. It has a good concise
                        summary (starting at page iv of Tab B) which we recommend you read.

                    <p>The basic problem of allowing <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> above the

                    <p>—The second category consists of excavation <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNEs</gloss>, such as for building canals; these explosions necessarily
                        leave radioactive debris on the surface of the earth and in the atmosphere.
                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> in this category are sometimes
                        distinguishable from practical nuclear weapons, but only with onerous and
                        costly on-site inspection which may prove impossible to negotiate.
                        Furthermore, excavation <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> either below
                        or above 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> raise the difficult issue of

                    <p>Because the two <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> categories—contained and
                        excavation—pose quite different verification problems, they are treated in
                        building-block form in the working group’s issues paper. This paper presents
                        four approaches to handling <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> (see pages
                        72–84 of Tab B for details):</p>
                    <p>1. Prohibit all <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>.</p>

                    <p>4. Permit contained <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>

                        This option is considered largely for the sake of completeness although it
                        could have some tactical value in the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        negotiations. An argument could be made that banning <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> would strengthen the nonproliferation
                        regime, remove a major obstacle to the comprehensive test ban the Soviets
                        claim to be pushing, and eliminate a major verification difficulty in the
                        TTBT. Furthermore, given the active Soviet <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> program and the moribund <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> program, this option would be easy for us to accept.

                        this option at the outset of the negotiations as an “illustrative” outcome.
                        The British prefer this option both for substantive and tactical purposes
                        (see our previous memorandum on <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> views at

                        However, we would probably end up having to justify this quasi-support, thus

                        radiation standards which are tentatively scheduled for November.</p>
                    <p>We are not sure what the Soviet motive was in submitting the new agenda.
                            <persName corresp="#p_VY_1">Vorontsov</persName> could simply have been
                        confused between the October Article III/Article V talks and the possible
                        radioactivity talks in November. A second possibility is that the Soviet
                        authorities have been working on a genuine assumption that Article V
                        subjects would include technical aspects of radioactivity standards. There
                        has been some ambiguity in our exchanges on this which could support a
                        misunderstanding. Finally, the Soviets could be deliberately attempting to
                        skew the October agenda so that we will talk about their interest in relaxed
                        radiation standards for <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> before they
                        discuss our verification concerns under Article III of the <gloss
                            target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss>. Regardless of which of these
                        interpretations is right, we should for now stick to our proposed agenda.
                        Accordingly, State gave the Soviets a note last Friday (Tab J) reiterating
                        our understanding that Article III and Article V will be the subjects of the
                        October talks.</p>

                            >Duckett</persName>), what do you have for us?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DC_1">Duckett</persName>: I thought I might refresh
                        your memory on the Soviet peaceful uses tests. (Using chart “Soviet Peaceful
                        Uses of Nuclear Explo<pb n="297" facs="0331" xml:id="pg_297"/>sions”) We
                        have identified [<hi rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>] tests in
                        this category and that is not necessarily a complete list. [<hi
                            rend="italic">2 lines not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>The largest yield has been [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] and was probably an attempt to create a new storage
                        area or to stimulate the flow of oil or gas.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: How do they do that?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DC_1">Duckett</persName>: They break up the shale and
                        create new cavities for the oil or gas to enter. They can also use it to
                        seal off a leak or to put out a fire. The largest in the latter category was
                        about [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]. Since
                        mid-1972 all their tests have been in cavity stimulation. Their experiments
                        with cratering explosions apparently were finished at that time. Cratering
                        is important to the Soviets because of the Pechora-Kama Canal project. A
                            [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] explosion
                        would be required for the canal and, if they fired in salvo, it could mean
                        as much as [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>].</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’ve looked at the
                        working group papers and there are some problems on our nonproliferation
                        preferences, including the strong views of some of the agencies, and our
                        negotiating record. We cannot overturn what the President and <persName
                            corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> agreed to in June.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: What did they agree to?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Let’s not be
                        disingenuous. They agreed that we would negotiate concerning tests over
                            150<gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> to determine whether with on-site
                        inspection and other provisions it was possible to distinguish <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> from weapons tests. We may conclude it is
                        impossible, but that is different from saying that it is undesirable. They
                        agreed that we would look at the validity of on-site inspection. This was
                        not a secret negotiation. At the lower <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>
                        yield, the problem was less severe. The main problem was the site. We would
                        have to have adequate verification at the sites.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName>: And some exchange of
                        information.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. Above 150 <gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>, the Soviets agreed to on-site inspection
                        but this was not defined. We said we would look at the above 150 <gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> problem to see how it could be reconciled
                        with the Threshold Test Ban. We cannot now say that, on nonproliferation
                        grounds, we are overthrowing that understanding. We can negotiate on the
                        relationship of this to the Limited Test Ban Treaty. We have no obligation
                        to overthrow the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>. It’s hard to think
                        of uses of above 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> in relation to the
                        LTB but that’s a Soviet problem. We have no obligation to let them use the
                            <gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss> to abrogate the <gloss
                            target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>. I’m not saying we should modify our
                        position so as to change the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>. We have
                        no interest in having the Soviets testing above 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1"
                            >KT</gloss>. But we have to make a serious effort to see if we can
                        devise criteria to identify peaceful uses above 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1"
                            >KT</gloss>.</p>

                    <p>You have pending before you (Action 2101) the package on environmental
                        warfare. A decision is needed on what approach to take in opening the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        talks on this subject, which were agreed to at the summit (Tab A).</p>
                    <p>As you recall, after the summit the Soviets put environmental warfare on the
                            <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> agenda, and have introduced a
                        draft resolution and convention (Tab B). They want the latter to be referred
                        to the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> for examination and a report to
                        the next <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss>. Both the resolution and
                        convention give us trouble because they:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>—are broader in concept than we envisaged,</p>
                        <p>—go beyond military limitation and could constitute a restraint on civil
                            environmental activity,</p>
                        <p>—launch the issue in a multilateral forum before we have had an
                            opportunity to explore it bilaterally, and</p>

                        <p>—prejudge the appropriate mechanism for imposing restraints by limiting

                    </quote>
                    <p>The Soviets are expected to press their <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1"
                            >UNGA</gloss> initiative when debate begins in the First Committee. This
                        could come as early as October 16. State believes we have no chance of
                        derailing the matter altogether. However, if we act promptly, we might be
                        able to change the Soviet resolution to avoid prejudging the outcome of
                        negotiations in the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> (a draft cable to
                            <gloss target="#t_USUN_1">USUN</gloss> is at Tab C).</p>
                    <p>At the <gloss target="#t_SRG_1">SRG</gloss> on environmental warfare, you
                        indicated that the bilateral talks would be expected to defuse or delay the
                        Soviet <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> effort. The Soviets have given no
                        indication that they subscribe to this view, and on September 24, <persName
                            corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName> piously told you the Soviet
                        initiative would further our bilateral talks. Having already made their
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> pitch, it is doubtful the Soviets can
                        or will want to put the cat back into the bag.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, we need your guidance urgently on the following questions:</p>
                    <p>1. Will you, by a direct approach to the Soviets, again seek to get them to
                        postpone their <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> initiative?</p>
                    <p>_______ I will handle it with the Soviets. Prepare talking points.</p>
                    <p>_______ Let State handle it.</p>
                    <p>_______ In Moscow In New York</p>
                    <p>_______ No</p>
                    <p>_______ Other</p>
                    <p>2. Do you want <gloss target="#t_USUN_1">USUN</gloss> to be working with the
                        Soviets (and some friends) to improve the Soviet resolution?</p>
                    <p>_______ Yes</p>
                    <p>_______ No. Wait for bilateral approach.</p>
                    <p>_______ Other</p>
                    <p>3. Should we set a date for bilaterals with the Soviets (on the assumption we
                        will soon have <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> position) or should we
                        consider them <gloss target="#t_OBE_1">OBE</gloss> and deal with the issue
                        in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CCD_1"
                            >CCD</gloss>?</p>
                    <p>_______ Set date.</p>
                    <p>_______ I’ll set the date during my Moscow trip.</p>

                    <p>The following instructions are approved for the negotiations on underground
                        nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes (<gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNEs</gloss>) beginning in Moscow on October 7, 1974.</p>
                    <p>1. The delegation should state that it proceeds from the assumption that the
                        basic purpose of the negotiations is to develop a <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> agreement as called for in Article III of the Threshold
                        Test Ban Treaty (TTBT).</p>
                    <p>2. In the initial stage of the negotiations the principal task of the
                        delegation will be to elicit Soviet views and proposals on the content of
                        the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> agreement. Toward this end, the
                        delegation should set forth at the outset of the negotiations the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> view that the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> agreement must satisfy the following criteria:</p>
                    <p>a. <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> must not provide weapon-related
                        benefits otherwise precluded or limited by the TTBT.</p>
                    <p>b. The fact <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> activities are not
                        contributing to such benefits must be adequately verifiable.</p>
                    <p>c. The agreement must be consistent with existing treaty obligations,
                        including in particular the Limited Test Ban Treaty (<gloss
                            target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>).</p>
                    <p>The delegation should seek Soviet views on the above criteria.</p>
                    <p>3. The delegation should state that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        has several concerns related to how these criteria can best be satisfied;
                        therefore, we need at an early date Soviet views on several issues. In
                        particular:</p>
                    <p>a. What specific provisions do the Soviets propose to ensure that <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> are used for peaceful purposes only and
                        will not provide weapon testing benefits otherwise precluded or limited by
                        the TTBT, particu<pb n="301" facs="0335" xml:id="pg_301"/>larly weapon
                        development, military effects experiments, or testing of stockpile
                        weapons?</p>
                    <p>b. What will be the specific rights and functions of observers?</p>
                    <p>c. What information on geography, geology, and other factors descriptive of
                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> operations will be exchanged to
                        facilitate verification?</p>
                    <p>4. The delegation should state that, in order to systematically examine the
                        above concerns, the two sides will need to exchange appropriately detailed
                        descriptions of their respective <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        programs at an early time, including information on types of <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> operations and sizes and numbers of
                        explosions.</p>
                    <p>5. With regard to the implementation of Article V of the Non-Proliferation
                        Treaty (<gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>), when this is raised by the
                        Soviets the Delegation should state that it has no views to express on this
                        subject at the present time, but would like to hear the views of the Soviet
                        Delegation on how this might be dealt with in the upcoming <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> Review Conference.</p>
                    <p>6. The delegation should refrain from discussing the relationship of <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> to achieving nonproliferation
                        objectives.</p>
                    <p>7. The delegation is not authorized to negotiate or discuss any changes in
                        the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> or to discuss possible
                        radioactivity criteria under the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>.</p>

                            corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MID_1"
                            >Morokhov</persName>, plenaries will be limited to two or three per
                        week, agenda will be projected one meeting forward.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_MID_1">Morokhov</persName> and Timerbaev both
                        devoted considerable time to subject of public releases on negotiations.
                        First preference was that there be none. Acceptable alternatives are: (A)
                        release stating that negotiations have begun on <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNEs</gloss> with primary reference to Article III of TTBT and clear
                        explanation that specific attention will be paid to factors relevant to
                        Article V of <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>, or (B) release stating
                        that negotiations have begun on subject of <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNEs</gloss> without reference to any particular treaty. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> stated that these views will be
                        forwarded to Washington for consideration.</p>
                    <p>4. Soviet emphasis on Article V of <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>
                        continued with lengthy remarks by <persName corresp="#p_MID_1"
                            >Morokhov</persName> on importance of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss>-Soviet understanding on active approach to making <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> services available to non-nuclear
                        countries. Rationale was that nuclear proliferation needs to be deterred,
                        the problem has been made harder by Indian action, and only way to serve the
                        purpose of nonproliferation is to make <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>
                        aggressively available to deprive interested countries of grounds for
                        proceeding independently.</p>
                    <p>5. Argument further made that <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet
                        bilateral <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> agreement should provide for
                        joint development of <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> technology for
                        services to third countries. <persName corresp="#p_MID_1"
                            >Morokhov</persName> did not elaborate on meaning of “joint
                        development.”</p>
                    <p>6. Claim made that <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> has expressed desire to
                        be eligible for <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> services from <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                        >USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>7. In response to observation that <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> is
                        multilateral treaty, <persName corresp="#p_MID_1">Morokhov</persName> argued
                        that nevertheless only two countries (<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>) are <pb n="303" facs="0337"
                            xml:id="pg_303"/>able to provide <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        services. Therefore, need for <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>–<gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> bilateral understanding on <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> service arrangements.</p>
                    <p>8. Problem of <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> mentioned in connection
                        with schedule for <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> meeting in January
                        1975 on technical topics. Timerbaev acknowledged without objection that
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has informed Soviets that our
                        delegation for current talks would not be prepared to discuss radioactivity
                        standards. <persName corresp="#p_MID_1">Morokhov</persName> stressed
                        importance of going through with bilateral talks in preparation for <gloss
                            target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> January meeting. He noted absence of
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> reply to Soviet proposal that
                        bilateral talks be held in November 1974.</p>
                    <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_MID_1">Morokhov</persName> noted that <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> program is “frozen” while Soviet
                        program is going forward. He stated the opinion that the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would regret this in future and declared
                        Soviet willingness to share <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> information
                        and experience with us to help the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                    </p>
                    <p>10. Near end of meeting <persName corresp="#p_MID_1">Morokhov</persName>
                        suggested that the best way to deal with the varied ramifications of <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> (e.g., relation to TTBT, <gloss

                        would be to broaden the scope of negotiations and aim for a comprehensive
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> reiterated that primary
                        task at hand is to develop a basis for <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        agreement in implementation of TTBT Article III.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The concept of environmental warfare envisages advertent modification of the
                        weather, climate, oceans, or terrestrial properties for military or hostile
                        purposes. Deliberate and controlled modifications are today theoretical
                        possibilities only with the exception that operational or near-operational
                        techniques exist for a few types of weather modification (for example,
                        precipitation and fog modification).</p>
                    <p>As a result of an interagency review and a recent Senior Review Group meeting
                        on this subject, all agencies except the <gloss target="#t_JCS_1"
                            >JCS</gloss> consider that <hi rend="italic">some</hi> restraints on
                        environmental warfare are in our interest. The <gloss target="#t_JCS_1"
                            >JCS</gloss> prefer no restraints but consider the restraints
                        recommended by <gloss target="#t_OSD_1">OSD</gloss> below acceptable.</p>
                    <p>All agencies also agree that there should be no international restraints
                        either on <gloss target="#t_RD_1">R&amp;D</gloss> or on using weather
                        modification techniques solely to protect forces from natural hazards.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> agreed at the Moscow
                        Summit in June to advocate bringing about the most effective measures
                        possible against the dangers of using environmental modification techniques
                        for military purposes and to begin discussions with the Soviets this year on
                        the subject. This decision was set forth in the U.S./USSR Joint Communiqué
                        and the Joint Statement on Environmental Warfare. The Soviets have moved
                        ahead to seek a <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> General Assembly
                        resolution on this subject and their proposal gives us some problems which
                        we will wish to iron out. Before entering into the agreed bilateral
                        discussions, however, agency disagreement on the scope of restraints we
                        should seek needs to be resolved.</p>
                    <pb n="305" facs="0339" xml:id="pg_305"/>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_OSD_1">OSD</gloss> believes that we should prohibit “any
                        military use of weather, climate, ocean, or terrestrial modification
                        techniques having long-lasting, widespread, or severe effects.” This would
                        in effect preclude hostile uses of all environmental modification techniques
                            <hi rend="italic">except for</hi> tactical fog or precipitation
                        modification. This choice would retain a military option which in certain
                        circumstances could have some utility, while banning the most potentially
                        dangerous activities that would be subject to reasonable verification.</p>
                    <p>The main drawback of this choice is that it would open us to domestic and
                        international criticism since we would be proposing to rule out <hi
                            rend="italic">only</hi> theoretically possible techniques, which would
                        at any rate have limited if any military application should they ever be
                        developed, <hi rend="italic">and not</hi> the things we know how to do and
                        have done (like rainmaking in Southeast Asia).</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">State and <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> strongly
                            believe</hi> that we should prohibit not only those restraints
                        recommended by <gloss target="#t_OSD_1">OSD</gloss> but also restraints on
                        precipitation and fog modification as weapons of war. This is the only
                        choice which would constitute a “peaceful uses only” policy toward
                        environment modification and meet with more general acceptance as a
                        definition of “environmental warfare.” It may also be the only basis on
                        which we could expect successful negotiations.</p>
                    <p>The drawbacks of this choice are that it would (1) foreclose military options
                        for fog and precipitation modification which could prove useful in some
                        conflict situations (if natural meteorological conditions permitted); and
                        (2) present some verification problems since tactical employment of weather
                        modification techniques might not be detectable.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">My View.</hi> The basic difference between the agencies is
                        that <gloss target="#t_OSD_1">OSD</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_JCS_1"
                            >JCS</gloss> wish to retain the right to use precipitation and fog
                        modification techniques as weapons of war. The military case, including our
                        operational rainmaking experience in Southeast Asia from 1966–1972, for
                        preserving these options does not appear very strong. On the other hand, the
                        restraints favored by <gloss target="#t_OSD_1">OSD</gloss> focus on
                        activities which would be subject to reasonable verification if ever
                        developed and undertaken, whereas tactical employment of fog and
                        precipitation modification techniques might not be detectable.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, <hi rend="italic">I believe</hi> our approach to the initial
                        exploratory talks with the Soviets should be consistent with the position
                        supported by <gloss target="#t_OSD_1">OSD</gloss> and the <gloss
                            target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss>. This would not preclude discussions and
                        perhaps a later <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> decision on broader
                        restraints if the Soviets raise them. Indeed, once we begin such
                        discussions, particularly if and when a multilateral agreement were desired,
                        we will in all likelihood have to address the question of a “peaceful uses
                        only” policy or prohibitions along the lines recommended by State and <gloss

                    <p>There may well be some criticism by the Soviets or in any public airing of

                            >U.S.</gloss>) obtain uranium enrichment services from the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. There is disagreement in <gloss

                        remaining after enrichment (tails) should be left in the Soviet Union or
                        returned to the West. The Soviets are willing to do either and leave it to
                        the discretion of the purchaser. The <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>,
                            <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>, and France consider tails as waste

                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> Under Secretaries Committee has
                        examined the issues involved and concluded that the potential strategic
                        significance of depleted uranium depends on how limited the Soviets
                        indigenous supply of raw uranium might be. Unfortunately, we do not have
                        full enough information on Soviet uranium resources to resolve the issue.

                            >AEC</gloss> recommend that we continue our policy of requiring the
                        return of tails. <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> is concerned that in
                        addition to potential strategic value of the depleted uranium, we may erode
                        our resolve toward the embargo of nuclear materials more generally if we
                        allow our position on tails to weaken.</p>
                    <p>The Federal Energy Administration, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency,
                        and the Council on International Economic Policy recommend that if
                        transaction tails are 0.2% or less, they can be left since the cost of
                        additional stripping is so uneconomic that the strategic value is negligible
                        for the foreseeable future.</p>
                    <p>State believes we ought to try to maintain our position in <gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> requiring the return of tails, but if
                        significant opposition develops we should be prepared to reexamine our
                        position with a view to finding an acceptable compromise, probably along the
                        line suggested above of setting a minimum tail content requiring return.</p>
                    <p>I support State’s suggestion for two reasons:</p>
                    <p>(1) We are engaged in an extensive <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss>
                        review with our allies in which we are trying to hold the line in a number
                        of important areas, such as computers. Our allies (particularly the British)
                        are not very sympathetic with our restrictive views, and we may find our
                        overall objectives regarding export control will be furthered if we are
                        prepared to compromise on the comparatively less important matter of
                        tails.</p>
                    <p>(2) Our evolving nonproliferation strategy will center on a system of
                        controls exercised by the nuclear suppliers, requiring a high degree of
                        collaboration among those nations. We will have to establish a cooperative
                        atmosphere in nuclear affairs generally if we are to be successful in
                        achieving our ends. This means not overriding our allies’ interests in
                            <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> unless our security concerns
                        warrant it, which is not the case in the question of the return of
                        tails.</p>
                    <p>The Joint committee on Atomic Energy and other interested congressional
                        committees should be kept informed of our <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1"
                            >COCOM</gloss> negotiations.</p>
                    <p>If you approve, I will issue the decision memorandum at Tab A which directs
                        that we seek to maintain our position in <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1"
                            >COCOM</gloss> requiring the return of tails; that we reexamine our

                    <p>The President has reviewed the report of the Under Secretaries Committee on

                        President has decided that we should seek to maintain our position in <gloss

                    <p>15497. Subject: TTBT/PNE Negotiations—Review of First Week’s Meetings.</p>
                    <p>1. At the conclusion of the first week’s meeting, the concerns of the two
                        delegations have become clearer. The Soviets appear to recognize that our
                        primary concern is with adequate verification of <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNEs</gloss> under Article III of the TTBT, whereas they have stated
                        that their objective is a more comprehensive agreement with minimal
                        restrictions on <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> activities. In this
                        approach, the Soviets are apparently offering us some sort of a partnership
                        in <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> matters in which it is implied that
                        we would then have all the information needed to verify that no weapons
                        related benefits were being obtained.</p>
                    <p>2. Their approach to verification as presented would consist of primary
                        reliance on national means for <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> below
                        the threshold, and above the threshold information exchange including yield,
                        purpose, place and time prior to event and actual yield and results
                        afterward. They have stated that consideration of more extensive information
                        and other arrangements going beyond their view of Article III of TTBT could
                        only be in context of broader agreement on <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNEs</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_MID_1">Morokhov</persName> has
                        repeatedly stressed the need for a broad agreement. In the expressed Soviet
                        view, broad agreement would include <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        cooperation in Soviet <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> activities on a
                        reciprocal basis and they claim that this would obviate the need for
                        observers. They have indicated that arrangements for cooperation might allow
                        the presence of “representatives” which would be considerably more
                        acceptable to the Soviet bureaucracy than “observers.”</p>
                    <p>3. The Soviets have repeatedly stressed the importance of the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> generally and Article V, in particular,
                        and the direct linkage of <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> to Article
                        III of the TTBT. They have also been somewhat critical of our position (para
                        5, State 221218) as being inconsistent with their understanding of our
                        agenda. It is not clear at this time whether multilateral <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> projects under Article V of the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> are really a primary Soviet objective or
                        whether they are simply using <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> Article V
                        as an argument for pressing for the kind of agreement they prefer.</p>
                    <pb n="310" facs="0344" xml:id="pg_310"/>
                    <p>4. The limited character of Soviet comments thus far suggests that the
                        Soviets may be assuming that the Limited Test Ban Treaty might not represent
                        a serious problem in these negotiations. Their statement is (<gloss
                            target="#t_REFReftel_1">reftel</gloss> Moscow 15373) that preambular
                        language should reaffirm commitment to the goals of the <gloss
                            target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>, whereas we have stated as a criterion
                        that any <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> agreement must be consistent
                        with the provisions of the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>. Without
                        further elaboration, they might assert that our views are equivalent.</p>

                        General Assembly Debate</p>
                    <p>As we start our annual disarmament debate, my government believes it
                        appropriate to devote its initial statement on disarmament questions
                        exclusively to one of the most critical matters before the 29th General
                        Assembly—the objective of limiting the growth and spread of nuclear
                        weapons.</p>
                    <p>Since the advent of the nuclear age, we have been forced to live with the
                        dilemma of the dual nature of nuclear energy. We have held high expectations
                        concerning the contribution that nuclear energy could make to human welfare;
                        but we have always been painfully aware that tied to these expected benefits
                        is a growing potential for mankind’s destruction. The rapidly expanding use
                        of nuclear reactors to generate electric power in recent years has made this
                        dilemma one of the most urgent issues of our time.</p>
                    <p>An inevitable result of the massive growth of nuclear-generated power will be
                        the tremendous increase in worldwide production of plutonium. Estimates are
                        that by 1980 close to 1 million pounds of <pb n="312" facs="0346"
                            xml:id="pg_312"/>plutonium will have been produced worldwide in electric
                        power reactors, enough to manufacture over 50,000 nuclear explosive
                        devices.</p>
                    <p>In addition, rising demands for enriched uranium as a nuclear reactor fuel
                        will require a marked expansion of uranium enrichment capacity.</p>
                    <p>Widespread development of enrichment facilities, perhaps involving new
                        enrichment techniques, could create a capability for producing weapons-grade
                        uranium at many locations throughout the world.</p>
                    <p>This increasing availability of nuclear fuels and materials, as well as the
                        continuing dissemination of nuclear technology, threatens to place a nuclear
                        explosive capability, and the accompanying capability to produce nuclear
                        weapons, within the reach of an ever-widening group of states. As perilous
                        as the situation was when there were only two states with a nuclear weapons
                        capability—and is now with six—stability would be vastly more precarious in
                        a world of many nuclear powers.</p>
                    <p>Such a world is not to be feared more by one group of states than another.
                        All nations would stand to lose.</p>
                    <p>States fortunate enough to be located in regions now free of nuclear weapons
                        would suddenly find themselves faced with nuclear-armed neighbors. This
                        would bring them under strong pressures to acquire nuclear weapons
                        themselves. Even minor conflicts would then involve the risk of escalation
                        to nuclear war. The probability of the use of nuclear weapons—whether by
                        design, miscalculation, or accident—would increase sharply. Prospects for
                        significant arms control and disarmament measures would deteriorate as all
                        states felt the need to prepare for a larger and more disparate range of
                        contingencies.</p>
                    <p>Many have assumed that time was on our side—that every year without the use
                        of nuclear weapons, every year without an additional nuclear power, every
                        step in East-West détente, and every measure to curb the arms race have all
                        been part of a steady progression to where we would no longer fear the
                        possibility of nuclear war. But it is obvious, in light of the worldwide
                        energy crisis and the emergence after a 10-year hiatus of an additional
                        state with a nuclear explosive capability, that we cannot afford to be
                        complacent.</p>
                    <p>Hopefully, these developments will at least have the positive effect of
                        making us fully alert to the dangers of the further spread of nuclear
                        explosives and of encouraging a determined international effort to avert
                        that possibility.</p>
                    <p>We are now at an important juncture, perhaps a decisive one. The challenge,
                        as Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> well
                        described it to the General Assembly on September 23, is “to realize the
                        peaceful benefits of nuclear technology without contributing to the growth
                        of nuclear weapons or to the number of states possessing them.”</p>
                    <pb n="313" facs="0347" xml:id="pg_313"/>
                    <p>The United States does not believe that a world of many nuclear powers is
                        inevitable. Nor does it believe that the peaceful uses of nuclear energy
                        must necessarily be cut back because of the risk that nuclear technology
                        will be diverted to military purposes. However, we cannot expect to take
                        full advantage of the expanding use of nuclear energy unless we are willing
                        to strengthen the system for assuring one another that there is nothing to
                        fear in the continued diffusion of nuclear materials and technology.</p>
                    <p>While working toward a more universal and effective system of assurances or
                        safeguards, we must also strengthen the political and economic incentives
                        for resisting the temptation to acquire nuclear explosive capabilities.
                        Those capabilities would inevitably be perceived as a threat to others and
                        therefore trigger a competition in the destructive potential of nuclear
                        devices.</p>
                    <p>No state or group of states can meet the challenge alone. What is required in
                        the months and years ahead is a sustained and concerted international effort
                        involving nuclear-weapon states and non-nuclear-weapon states, nuclear
                        suppliers and importers, parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (<gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>) and states which have not yet seen it in
                        their interest to join the treaty. My government would like to suggest
                        several tasks which members of the world community, individually and
                        collectively, should undertake in meeting this challenge.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">First, cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy
                            should be continued.</hi> It could be argued that the most appropriate
                        response to the increasing risk of diversion of nuclear technology to
                        hostile purposes would simply be to cut back on international cooperation in
                        the nuclear energy field. The United States does not believe such a course
                        of action would serve nonproliferation objectives, nor would it be
                        responsive to the pressing need throughout the world to receive the benefits
                        of this important new source of energy. The United States recognizes fully
                        that the vast potential benefits of nuclear energy cannot be monopolized by
                        a handful of advanced industrial states. This is especially true at a time
                        when many of the world’s developing countries are among the hardest hit by
                        global economic difficulties.</p>
                    <p>As a member of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy of the Congress, I have
                        been privileged to participate in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        efforts to make the peaceful applications of atomic energy widely available.
                        The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government has facilitated the
                        participation of American industry in atomic power activities abroad. It has
                        sponsored large international conferences to share our technical know-how.
                        It has shipped materials abroad to help others move ahead in nuclear
                        technology. And it has given strong support to the International Atomic
                        Energy Agency (<gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>) and to that Agency’s
                        programs in the nuclear field. All told, it has spent hundreds of millions
                        of dollars to promote peaceful uses <pb n="314" facs="0348" xml:id="pg_314"
                        />worldwide. We intend to continue this effort, both through our bilateral
                        cooperative arrangements and our support for the work of the <gloss

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Second, we should intensify our search for effective
                            measures to curb the competition in nuclear arms.</hi> We are mindful
                        that serious risks are involved in the further accumulation of nuclear
                        weapons by states now possessing them, as well as in the spread of weapons
                        capabilities to additional states. Moreover, we know that we cannot expect
                        non-nuclear-weapon states to show restraint unless nuclear powers also
                        practice restraint.</p>
                    <p>As one of the principal nuclear powers, the United States recognizes its
                        special responsibility in this area. We are aware of the concerns expressed
                        by a number of countries about the pace of progress in nuclear disarmament.
                        Although proud of achievements already made, we would agree that progress
                        has been disappointingly slow. We understand the impatience of others, and
                        ourselves are anxious to proceed faster. But it must be recognized that
                        these complicated issues, touching upon the vital interests of all states,
                        are rarely susceptible to quick and easy solutions.</p>

                        <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and Soviet negotiators recently
                        reconvened their talks in Geneva on strategic arms limitations. We attach
                        the utmost importance to these negotiations, in which members of this body
                        have also expressed much interest.</p>
                    <p>The talks are currently aimed at concluding an equitable agreement placing
                        quantitative and qualitative limitations on offensive strategic weapons. We
                        will make every effort to reach such an agreement at the earliest possible
                        date. In addition, the United States remains firmly committed to seek an
                        adequately verified comprehensive test ban. The Threshold Test Ban Treaty,
                        negotiated in Moscow last summer, has significance not only for its
                        restraining effect on <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet nuclear
                        arms competition but also as a step toward our ultimate goal of a
                        comprehensive ban. Indeed, in the first article of that treaty, we reaffirm
                        our commitment to pursue further negotiations toward that goal.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Third, steps should be taken to insure the widest possible
                            adherence to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.</hi> It is noteworthy that,
                        while treaty parties have sometimes urged faster implementation of
                        provisions of the NonProliferation Treaty, there is virtual unanimity among
                        them that the treaty’s basic concepts and structure are sound and that the
                        treaty continues to provide a valuable legal framework for dealing with both
                        the peaceful and military applications of nuclear energy. My government
                        continues to regard the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> as one of the
                        most significant international agreements of the post-World War II era.
                        Recently, President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> called the
                        treaty “one of the pillars of United States foreign policy.”</p>
                    <p>The Non-Proliferation Treaty has been criticized as discriminatory in that it
                        divides the world into two categories of states: those with <pb n="315"
                            facs="0349" xml:id="pg_315"/>nuclear explosive devices and those
                        without. But the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> did not create that
                        distinction, nor is it intended to condone it. The negotiators of the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> recognized that the only promising and
                        realistic approach was to start with the world the way it was. Accordingly
                        the treaty calls for a halt to the further spread of explosive capabilities
                        and obligates existing nuclear powers to speed limitations and reductions of
                        their own stockpiles.</p>
                    <p>If there had been no effort, such as the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                        >NPT</gloss>, to halt the spread of nuclear weapons or if the effort had
                        been postponed until nuclear-weapon states had abolished their arsenals, we
                        would have found ourselves in a world of so many nuclear powers that further
                        attempts to stop “vertical proliferation”—that is, to limit and reduce
                        nuclear weapons—would be futile.</p>

                        we should consider ways of making the treaty more attractive to existing and

                        consideration in the donation by the United States of special nuclear

                            >IAEA</gloss> medical research projects. We have also decided to give
                        preference to <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> parties in allocating
                        training and equipment grants for <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>
                        technical assistance programs. And we encourage others to adopt similar
                        policies.</p>
                    <p>We would welcome further suggestions for increasing incentives for <gloss

                        national security significance. We have offered to permit such safeguards to
                        demonstrate our belief that there is no threat to proprietary information
                        and no risk of suffering commercial disadvantage under <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> safeguards.</p>
                    <p>Nuclear exporters should make special efforts to insure that their transfers
                        of nuclear materials and equipment do not contribute to the acquisition of
                        nuclear explosive capabilities. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        will shortly approach the principal supplier countries with specific
                        proposals for making safeguards more effective.</p>
                    <p>One of the problems to be faced in the years ahead is the challenge of
                        meeting rapidly increasing demands for uranium enrichment and <pb n="317"
                            facs="0351" xml:id="pg_317"/>chemical reprocessing services without
                        undermining safeguards. An alternative to developing national facilities for
                        these services—one which would be both economical and conducive to effective
                        safeguards—might be the establishment of multinational plants capable of
                        satisfying world demands.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Sixth, steps should be taken to insure the physical
                            security of nuclear facilities and materials.</hi> As the civil nuclear
                        industry expands throughout the world, nuclear materials will become an
                        increasing factor in international commerce and the threat of theft or
                        diversion could become acute. While physical security must be the primary
                        responsibility of national governments, we believe the world community can
                        play an important role. Accordingly, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> stated on September 23 that the United States will
                        urge the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> to develop an international
                        convention for enhancing physical security against theft or diversion of
                        nuclear material.</p>
                    <p>Such a convention should outline specific standards and techniques for
                        protecting materials while in use, storage, and transfer. The United States,
                        moreover, agrees with Director General [<persName corresp="#p_EAS_1">A.
                            Sigvard</persName>] <persName corresp="#p_EAS_1">Eklund</persName>’s
                        recommendation that the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> should
                        prepare itself to be a source of advice and assistance to nations that wish
                        to improve their physical security practices.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Seventh, and finally, we should support and encourage the
                            development of regional arrangements which contribute to
                            nonproliferation objectives.</hi> While the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                            >NPT</gloss> has played a central role in efforts to curb nuclear
                        proliferation, the United States believes that complementary tools should
                        also be used to serve that objective. Accordingly, we support the treaty
                        establishing a nuclear-free zone in Latin America, so far the only densely
                        populated region in the world to set up a formal regime to ban nuclear
                        weapons.</p>
                    <p>We also welcome the interest shown in nuclear-free zones at this General
                        Assembly, in particular in the proposals for creating nuclear-free zones in
                        the Middle East and South Asia.</p>
                    <p>On several occasions my government has put forward four criteria for the
                        establishment of nuclear-free zones:</p>
                    <p>1. The initiative should be taken by the states in the region concerned.</p>
                    <p>2. The zone should preferably include all states in the area whose
                        participation is deemed important.</p>
                    <p>3. The creation of the zone should not disturb necessary security
                        arrangements.</p>
                    <p>4. Provision should be made for adequate verification.</p>
                    <p>We would take these criteria into account in assessing any specific regional
                        arrangement.</p>
                    <pb n="318" facs="0352" xml:id="pg_318"/>
                    <p>Another factor my government would take into account would be the treatment
                        of <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> in any nuclear-free-zone proposal.
                        When the United States adhered to Additional Protocol II of the Treaty for
                        the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America, it was with the
                        understanding that the treaty does not permit nonnuclear states party to the
                        treaty to develop peaceful nuclear explosive devices. We accordingly regard
                        the Latin American nuclear-free zone as consistent with our objective of
                        curbing the spread of independent nuclear explosive capabilities.</p>
                    <p>We have suggested the principal tasks which we think should be undertaken in
                        dealing with the vital issues of nuclear arms control and look forward to
                        hearing the views of other delegations on these suggestions. A broadly based
                        collective effort should be made by all—nuclear and nonnuclear, <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> parties and nonparties, industrially
                        advanced and developing states alike—if we are to save our own and future
                        generations from a world of many nuclear powers and unrestrained nuclear
                        arms competition.</p>

                    <p>The 1925 Geneva Protocol in effect prohibits the <hi rend="italic">first use

                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> asked the Senate to
                        consent to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> ratification of the Protocol
                        with the <pb n="319" facs="0353" xml:id="pg_319"/>understanding that it does

                    <p>The Senate Foreign Relations Committee (<gloss target="#t_SFRC_1"
                            >SFRC</gloss>) strongly supports the Protocol but disagrees with our
                        position on these two agents. There appears to be little prospect of

                            recently reported that the Senate should simply consent to <gloss

                    </p>
                    <p>In 1971, the <gloss target="#t_SFRC_1">SFRC</gloss> asked us to reconsider
                        our position on these two agents, and President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                            >Nixon</persName> directed an interagency review of our position and
                        possible alternatives. The options and agency views expressed below resulted
                        from that review.</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">basic question</hi> is whether the military benefits in
                        retaining the option <hi rend="italic">to initiate use</hi> of tear gas and
                        herbicides in war outweigh the political costs of our not becoming a party
                        to the Protocol.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The advantage of preserving the option to initiate use of
                            these agents in war</hi> is that it would allow us to use them in any
                        future military conflicts, as deemed militarily useful to accomplish
                        missions or save lives.</p>
                    <p>Tear gas is a useful weapon in many military situations against an enemy with
                        little protective equipment (masks) and retaliatory capability. Its use in
                        Vietnam saved <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and allied lives.
                        Herbicides can be a useful support to military operations provided that
                        special circumstances exist. In Vietnam, they were used widely and proved
                        useful in selected instances. These agents also have important military
                        limitations. Tear gas effectiveness is significantly decreased if an enemy
                        has effective masks and may provide no relative advantage if he has a
                        comparable retaliatory capability (e.g., the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss> and other major powers). Herbicides can be used widely
                        only where there are negligible threats to the aircraft, and herbicides take
                        from hours to months to take effect (thereby allowing the enemy time to
                        react).</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The disadvantages of preserving the first use option for
                            these agents</hi> are that this would probably result in failure to
                        obtain Senate consent to ratify the Protocol, and this would (1) result in
                        some adverse international and domestic criticism (only 4 of the 98 parties
                        to the Protocol have sided with us on this issue while 52 have expressly
                        disagreed); (2) leave the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> the only
                        militarily important country not a party to the Protocol; and (3) dissipate
                        the favorable impact here and abroad of President <persName

                        accomplished in a manner that does not concede that our past interpretation

                    <p>State and <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> differ only on the tactical

                        option for these agents.</p>
                    <p>State recommends that we agree to accept a prohibition on first use of these
                        agents against parties to the Protocol which confirm a reciprocal obligation
                        and that we accept this as a universal obligation if and when a substantial
                        majority of the parties confirms a reciprocal obligation. This could
                        facilitate resolution of our obligations on a one-for-one basis with some of
                        the key parties and perhaps lead to a general resolution of the issue among
                        the parties; <hi rend="italic">but</hi> this could result in a multitiered

                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> prefers that we consider the Protocol
                        as prohibiting first use of these agents from the date of <gloss

                        Senate consent to ratification; gain wide domestic and international
                        acceptance as an affirmative step; and clarify from the outset our own legal
                        obligations. <hi rend="italic">But</hi> this could be considered as implying
                        an admission of past error in policy and practice and upset those senators
                        and parties to the Protocol (particularly the <gloss target="#t_UK_1"
                            >UK</gloss> and Japan) who have supported our position.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> also considers that we could renounce
                        first use in war of these agents as a matter of national policy but not as a
                        matter covered by the Protocol. <gloss target="#t_OSD_1">OSD</gloss> would
                        prefer either this course or proposing a new treaty to ban first use if you
                        decide to forego the first use option.</p>
                    <p>The advantages of renouncing first use as a matter of policy are that this
                        would (1) not require any <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        reinterpretation of the Protocol; <pb n="321" facs="0355" xml:id="pg_321"
                        />(2) be most unlikely to be construed as any admission that our practices
                        have been contrary to the Protocol; and (3) be the easiest to implement as
                        it requires none of the diplomatic and/or legal procedures involved in the
                        other alternatives. But this may be criticized as more easily reversible
                        than a formal legal obligation under the Protocol.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">My View.</hi> The military utility of tear gas and, though
                        to a much lesser degree, herbicides is established in some types of conflict
                        situations. But there are important limitations on their usefulness.</p>
                    <p>Ratification of the Protocol is an important part of earlier administration
                        initiatives in chemical and biological weapons restraints and would ease the
                        way for ratification of the <gloss target="#t_BW_1">BW</gloss> Convention.
                        We are the only militarily significant country in the world not a party to
                        the Protocol, which the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> initiated back
                        in 1925, and <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> ratification of the <gloss
                            target="#t_BW_1">BW</gloss> Convention will lead to its coming into
                        force.</p>
                    <p>Only four countries have sided with our contention that tear gas and
                        herbicides are not covered by the Protocol. To remain unyielding entirely
                        would tend to dissipate the political plus resulting from our earlier
                        initiatives. If we attempt to preserve all military prerogatives for these
                        agents in war, we would get nowhere nearer favorable Senate action on these
                        initiatives. However, I believe that we should attempt to preserve the
                        option to use these agents in war in defensive situations to save lives, and
                        be willing to relinquish their use only as offensive weapons of war to
                        facilitate or increase enemy casualties.</p>
                    <p>I therefore recommend that we (1) renounce first use of herbicides <hi
                            rend="italic">except</hi> for base perimeter clearing; (2) renounce
                        first use of tear gas as an offensive weapon of war; and (3) preserve the
                        right to use tear gas (a) in riot control circumstances (including rioting
                        prisoners of war), (b) in avoiding or reducing civilian casualties, (c) in
                        rescue missions, and (d) in defensive warfare situations for the purpose of
                        saving lives. We would renounce these uses as a matter of national policy
                        and not as an international legal obligation under the Protocol.</p>
                    <p>I recognize that there may be some opposition within the Senate Foreign
                        Relations Committee to our proposal to preserve the right to initiate use in
                        defensive warfare situations, and would consult with key Senate leaders
                        before taking this step to resolve the impasse on ratification of the
                        Protocol.</p>

                    <p>The President has reviewed the interagency report on the riot control agents
                        and chemical herbicides issue and the Geneva Protocol of 1925 and associated
                        agency views.</p>
                    <p>The President considers it important that the United States ratify the Geneva
                        Protocol.</p>
                    <p>The President is therefore prepared, in reaffirming the current <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> understanding of the scope of the
                        Protocol, to renounce as a matter of national policy (1) first use of
                        herbicides in war except use, under regulations applicable to their domestic
                        use, for control of vegetation within <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        bases and installations or around their immediate defensive perimeters, and
                        (2) first use of riot control agents as an offensive weapon of war to
                        facilitate or increase casualties.</p>
                    <p>The President wishes, however, to preserve the option to use riot control
                        agents in riot control circumstances (to include controlling rioting
                        prisoners of war), in situations where civilian casualties can be reduced or
                        avoided, in rescue missions, and in defensive military modes to save lives.
                        The requirements regarding authorization for use of these agents in war, set
                        forth in <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 78 on August 11, 1970,
                        remain in effect.</p>
                    <p>Prior to deciding to take this step, however, the President has directed that
                        the Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament <pb n="323" facs="0357"
                            xml:id="pg_323"/>Agency, in consultation with the Departments of State
                        and Defense, promptly undertake the necessary discussions with key Senators
                        with the aim of achieving Senate advice and consent to ratification of the
                        Geneva Protocol at the earliest possible date. These consultations should
                        include the aim of achieving favorable Senate action on the Biological
                        Weapons Convention at the earliest possible date.</p>
                    <p>Both the fact and nature of the foregoing decisions should be closely held
                        prior to a report to the President on the completed consultations and his
                        approval of a public statement. This report should include consideration of

                    <p>16952. Subj: TTBT/PNE Negotiations—Final Summary and Comments.</p>
                    <p>1. Reference State 242830, paragraph two. Paragraphs two through five are
                        summary of status. Paragraphs six through fourteen are comments on future
                        course.</p>
                    <p>2. Status summary follows.</p>
                    <p>3. There were sixteen TTBT/PNE plenary meetings from October 7 through
                        November 6, and several restricted meetings. A working recess was commenced
                        after the November 6 meeting.</p>
                    <p>4. Statements of the two sides can be resolved into the following general
                        themes:</p>
                    <p>(A) The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> stated general criteria and
                        concerns, laid down in instructions, which any <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> agreement must reflect. The Soviets were <pb n="325"
                            facs="0359" xml:id="pg_325"/>asked in various ways how they proposed to
                        accommodate these criteria and concerns. <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> approach throughout was couched in as positive and
                        forthcoming terms as permitted by instructions.</p>
                    <p>(B) The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> taking note of Soviet technical
                        assessment of yields required for most contained applications, proposed ad
                        referendum that contained <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> applications
                        be limited to yields less than 100 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>,
                        subject to suitable verification procedures. Without going into detail,
                        elements of such verification, including observers, were stated. The <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> did not describe any ideas for
                        verification of excavation <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>(C) A basic Soviet view regarding <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> was
                        that there should be no limits on yields or numbers. It was stated that in
                        the case of contained applications most needs could be met by yields less
                        than 100 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>, although they say they see
                        possible long-term interest in larger yields. Most excavation needs could be
                        met by group aggregate yields less than 1,000 <gloss target="#t_KT_1"
                            >KT</gloss> and the number of individual explosions of yields above 150
                            <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> would not be large. No formal
                        commitment to these statements was made.</p>
                    <p>(D) The Soviet view of verification procedures to satisfy Article III of the
                        TTBT was described. The essential elements were dependence on national
                        technical means, augmented by information exchanges depending on yield and
                        circumstance with the kind and amount of information supplied to be
                        determined by the country carrying out the explosion. Soviet views are
                        contained in statement by Safronov (<gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        message forty-four).</p>
                    <p>(E) A major emphasis of the Soviets was on a joint cooperative <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> agreement which would involve exchange of
                        information and of scientists and other personnel on a basis of reciprocity.
                        A separate section would specify verification procedures to satisfy Article
                        III of TTBT as indicated in (D) above. However, exchange of personnel
                        (“representatives”) in projects would, it was claimed, reinforce
                        verification. Soviet outline of joint cooperative <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> proposal is contained in <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> message thirty-four. Delegation comments are contained in
                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> message thirty-nine.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_MID_1">Morokhov</persName> in statements on November
                        5 and 6 stated that <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and Soviets were
                        far apart in their respective positions, but that they looked forward to
                        resumption of negotiations. They do not want any constraints on numbers or
                        yields of explosions. They see no basis for considering contained and
                        excavation applications as separate categories. They want <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> views on cratering explosions. They were
                        unwilling to consider specific provisions for contained <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> only. It is only by consideration of a
                        complete package that an agreement could be reached.</p>
                    <p>6. Comments on future course follow.</p>
                    <pb n="326" facs="0360" xml:id="pg_326"/>
                    <p>7. In our judgment, progress can be made toward establishing a <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> agreement.</p>
                    <p>8. In order to move ahead, it will be necessary for the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to make a beginning on presentation of the
                        elements of a verification package which would encompass contained and
                        excavation applications.</p>
                    <p>9. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> needs to develop a basis for
                        discussing the interrelated issues linking the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1"
                            >LTBT</gloss>, excavation <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> projects,
                        and the verification of excavation <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        projects. If it should be the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> view that
                        compliance with the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> will, in
                        practical effect, rule out most excavation projects and if the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> should be unwilling to agree to an
                        accommodation for excavation projects, the Soviets would without any doubt
                        strongly oppose this view initially. We are not able to offer a meaningful
                        conjecture on what their final position might be.</p>
                    <p>10. Significant movement by the Soviets from their present verification
                        position will depend on their assessment of a total <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> verification package. However, the Soviet position has not
                        been couched in absolute or rigid terms and there are areas where one can
                        foresee the possibility of change, including the following:</p>
                    <p>(A) Soviet interest in high-yield contained <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> applications appears long range and even visionary in some
                        aspects. It is possible that they would be willing to accept (perhaps on an
                        interim basis) a yield limit on contained applications. If so, most probably
                        they would start by insisting that the TTBT yield threshold apply.</p>
                    <p>(B) The possibility of a quota on excavation events above the threshold
                        should not be ruled out.</p>
                    <p>(C) It is possible that they would be willing, in the context of a yield
                        limit on contained <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>, to accept a
                        requirement for the exchange of specified information above some
                        intermediate yield (say 75 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>).</p>
                    <p>11. There is insufficient basis at this time to make a meaningful conjecture
                        on how the Soviets might finally come out on the observer question. They say
                        they are willing to listen to our ideas about observer functions, but that
                        they will not discuss this subject except in context of a joint cooperative
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>12. The Soviets have clearly stated that one of their primary purposes is
                        establishment of a joint <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> cooperative
                        agreement. Their approach to verification is surely designed in part to
                        encourage the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to consider and accept
                        such an agreement. Although the Soviet ideas are a bare sketch, and full of
                        defects, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> should examine them
                        carefully for any elements of cooperation, both short and long term, which
                        could be of interest to us. Any positive position on cooperation could
                        possibly help gain concessions on verification issues.</p>
                    <p>13. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> will need to establish a basis
                        for discussion of the relationship between a <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> agreement and the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>.
                        Considerations should be reduced to an effort to induce the Soviets to:</p>
                    <pb n="327" facs="0361" xml:id="pg_327"/>
                    <p>(A) Accept the proposition that some limitations can be imposed on <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> without significant negative consequences
                        to the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> if those limitations are also
                        accepted by the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and if those limitations are essential
                        complements to verification arrangements to assure the integrity of nuclear

                    <p>(B) Accept the propositions that any <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>

                        Article V of <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> parties without
                        foreclosing the possibility of agreement on provision of <gloss

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Gerald R. Ford</persName> and General
                        Secretary of the Communist Party <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Leonid
                            Brezhnev</persName> held a series of meetings at the Okeanskaya military
                        sanatorium near Vladivostok November 23–24, 1974. During a conversation the
                        afternoon of November 24, <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> discussed the
                        possibility of negotiating a bilateral treaty specifying responses in the
                        event of a nuclear attack by a third party on the United States or the
                        Soviet Union, an idea former President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Richard
                            Nixon</persName> had raised with <persName corresp="#p_BL_1"
                            >Brezhnev</persName> at an earlier meeting:</p>
                    <p>“<persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>: This was in the Crimea. As
                        I am at all times, I was guided by the basic principle that there would be
                        no nuclear war between us or nuclear war in the world in general. I told
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> that there are some
                        countries which had not joined the Non-Proliferation Treaty and do not
                        observe it. Therefore a situation could arise where you or we could be
                        threatened with a nuclear attack. I thought it might be good for us to
                        conclude a treaty dealing only with a nuclear attack on one of our
                        countries. In the event of a nuclear attack on one, the other would come to
                        its aid with all the resources at its disposal.</p>
                    <pb n="328" facs="0362" xml:id="pg_328"/>
                    <p>“President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>, I recall, said that
                        this was interesting and that he would look further into it. I had some
                        further talks with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> on
                        this [in Moscow on October 26], but for various reasons nothing came of it.
                        That is where we stand.</p>
                    <p>“In the preamble we could say something like: we are aware of what a nuclear
                        war would mean in such circumstances and, desirous to avoid such an event,
                        the two sides, et cetera. We could do it so as to avoid giving offense to
                        allies—and in fact it would give a reassurance of protection to our
                        allies.</p>
                    <p>“President: As I told you, I was briefed on this in general terms. I want to
                        ask a couple of questions, and then Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> and Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2"
                            >Gromyko</persName> can discuss it further.</p>
                    <p>“I agree with President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>; it is
                        an interesting idea. One question is, does it mean strategic nuclear attack,
                        tactical nuclear attack, or any nuclear attack?</p>
                    <p>“<persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>: Under the treaty we would
                        each agree not to use nuclear weapons against anyone.</p>
                    <p>“President: They would be defensive only?</p>
                    <p>“<persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>“I agree to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> continuing
                        with subsequent discussions. My concept is related to any use of nuclear
                        weapons. What is the difference whether they are tactical or strategic?
                        Because in either case there would be a nuclear war, and we want to prevent
                        that.</p>
                    <p>“President: I asked because I wanted to know if it were a tactical nuclear
                        attack whether it would be an ‛all-force reaction,’ and I wondered whether
                        the response to different kinds of attack should be different. That is of
                        some importance.</p>
                    <p>“<persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>: The important thing is not
                        to have a nuclear attack on us or our allies. If we entered this kind of
                        arrangement, nuclear war would be impossible for decades to come. The basic
                        thing is to talk the general concept. We can then work on the details and go
                        into it deeper.</p>
                    <p>“President: Let me ask: what about an attack by a nuclear power on a third
                        party that is not an ally? What would be the situation?</p>
                    <p>“<persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>: It is hard to give a
                        precise answer. Perhaps we could agree to enter consultations as the best
                        course. A lot would depend on who attacked whom. This proposal hasn’t been
                        elaborated in detail. But since the United States and the Soviet Union are
                        the most important powers, an agreement like this between us would eliminate
                        nuclear war for many years to come.</p>
                    <p>“President: We do want to prevent nuclear war, and your country and mine have
                        a great responsibility. We should talk further. Meanwhile, I think we should
                        make a major effort to get the laggards to sign the Non-Proliferation
                        Treaty. There are some laggards.</p>

                    <p>“<persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>: I fully agree.</p>
                    <p>“President: Let’s have it between Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"

                        and the Non-Proliferation Treaty (<gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>) in

                        equipment, have been taken into account in this review.</p>
                    <p>On the basis of the review done pursuant to <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1"
                            >NSSM</gloss> 202, the Under Secretaries Committee, recognizing that the
                        proliferation problem is at a crucial juncture, recommends an intensified
                        program to inhibit the further spread of independent nuclear explosives
                        capabilities. This program would exploit the common interest of many key
                        countries in inhibiting proliferation by providing for concerted action. The
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> could both support such action and,
                        where appropriate, catalyze more effective international coordination.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretaries Committee recognizes that we might only be able to
                        delay further proliferation however determined our anti-proliferation
                        efforts may be, but concludes that <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        national security objectives can be served even with a nonproliferation
                        strategy that is only partially effective. It would be desirable to defer
                        the disadvantages associated with an expanded number of nuclear powers as
                        long as possible, while seeking to create conditions which might ultimately
                        check such expansion.</p>
                    <p>In the short run, the most effective approach to slowing down the spread of
                        nuclear weapons is for the advanced nuclear industrial states to tighten
                        controls on weapons-usable material and related production capabilities.
                        Proliferation can also be limited through maintaining and making more widely
                        applicable the legal and political barriers to acquisition of independent
                        nuclear explosives capabilities. In addition to the policy actions presented
                        below, a successful nonproliferation strategy will be affected particularly
                        by the confidence of non-nuclear weapon states that their security needs can
                        continue to be met without recourse to independent nuclear forces. It will
                        also be affected by perceptions of these states regarding progress in <gloss

                        safeguards to the maximum extent possible on peaceful nuclear programs of

                        parties.</p>
                    <p>—Restrict the spread of independent national uranium enrichment and chemical
                        reprocessing facilities through: (a) reaching common principles regarding
                        the supply of sensitive technology, equipment and assistance in the
                        construction of national facilities; and (b) encouraging multinational

                        nonproliferation considerations should be factored into <gloss

                        availability and supply of uranium enrichment services.</p>
                    <p>—Impose special conditions on nuclear exports to countries in sensitive
                        regions, such as certain areas in the Middle East, in order to minimize the
                        accumulation of plutonium and other special nuclear material. These
                        conditions would include such provisions as requiring that reprocessing,
                        storage and fabrication of plutonium derived from supplied nuclear material
                        or equipment take place in mutually agreed facilities outside the country or
                        region in question. In the case of <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>

                        widespread adoption and maintenance of meaningful physical security measures
                        on nuclear material. In this connection, the <gloss target="#t_US_1"

                        <item>Report Directed by <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 279 on
                            Senate Consent to Ratification of the Geneva Protocol of 1925 on Gas
                            Warfare</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>You will recall that past efforts to bring about ratification of the Geneva
                        Protocol, as for example in 1970, foundered on the issue of whether tear gas
                        and chemical herbicides would be banned along with more lethal chemical and
                        biological agents. The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations has interpreted
                        the prohibition as comprehensive, whereas the administration has insisted
                        that riot control agents (tear gas) and chemical herbicides are not covered.
                        Most parties to the Protocol have interpreted it as comprehensive.</p>
                    <p>As directed by <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 279, in consultation
                        with the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> staff and the Departments of
                        State and Defense, I have renewed discussions with key Senators regarding
                        advice and consent to ratification of the Geneva Protocol. It is likely that
                        an adequate understanding has been achieved for obtaining Senate advice and
                        consent to ratification of the Protocol within the guidelines which you
                        prescribed. Favorable Senate action on the Biological Weapons Convention
                        should present no difficulties and can be expected to accompany resolution
                        of the Protocol issue.</p>
                    <p>The situation at present is as follows: The Foreign Relations Committee will
                        consider a compromise aimed at producing a resolution of advice and consent
                        to permit ratification in accordance with the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> understanding of the scope of the Protocol, i.e., that it
                        does not cover <pb n="335" facs="0369" xml:id="pg_335"/>herbicides or riot
                        control agents (<gloss target="#t_RCA_1">RCAs</gloss>), provided you agree
                        to a broad though not exclusive renunciation of their use as a matter of
                        national policy. Many committee members, including Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_HHH_1">Humphrey</persName> who will probably chair the
                        hearing on this matter, are favorably disposed to a compromise along these
                        lines. Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName>, who has a
                        longstanding interest in the Protocol issue, has expressed some sympathy for
                        the compromise, but so far refuses to commit himself prior to the hearing.
                        Committee staff members feel that the compromise position stands a
                        reasonable chance of committee approval.</p>
                    <p>The content of the proposed renunciation, which has been approved by the
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> staff as well as the Departments of
                        State and Defense, is based on the language of <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1"
                            >NSDM</gloss> 279. It is attached as Tab A but may be described as
                        follows:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>The first use of herbicides in war is banned, except for control of
                            vegetation within <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> bases or around
                            their immediate perimeters. This is clearly consistent with the language
                            of the <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The renunciation of the first use of <gloss target="#t_RCA_1"
                                >RCAs</gloss> has been modified to make it plain that the options
                            for use preserved by the President are solely those of a defensive
                            nature, since the wording of the <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss>
                            was open to the interpretation that unspecified offensive uses were also
                            preserved.</p>
                        <p>The preserved use of <gloss target="#t_RCA_1">RCAs</gloss> described in
                            the <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss>, “in defensive military modes
                            to save lives,” has become the heading under which each of the preserved
                            uses falls, since each of them has the purpose of saving lives and is
                            defensive in nature.</p>
                        <p>A new preserved use has been added to provide for the protection of
                            convoys in rear echelon areas.</p>
                        <p>Finally, consistent with the requirement set forth in <gloss
                                target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 78 of August 11, 1970, advance
                            approval of the President is required before <gloss target="#t_RCA_1"
                                >RCAs</gloss> or chemical herbicides may be used in accordance with
                            any of these use exceptions.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>If you approve this compromise position, I recommend that you authorize me to
                        state your intention to conform <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy
                        to it, assuming Senate consent to ratification on this basis. I would so
                        state your intention when I appear before the Foreign Relations Committee on

                        policy, the ratification of the Biological Weapons Convention.</p>
                    <p>Assuming your approval of the position outlined above, (1) I plan to notify

                    <p>Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I appreciate the opportunity to
                        testify this morning on the Geneva Protocol of 1925<note n="2"

                            [Footnote is in the original.]</note> Ratification of these two arms
                        control agreements in the field of chemical and biological warfare has the
                        strong support of the President and the executive branch. We welcome the
                        initiative of the committee in holding this hearing, which we hope will lead
                        to prompt ratification of both agreements.</p>
                    <p>As you know, the Geneva Protocol of 1925 prohibits the use—in effect the
                        first use—of chemical and biological agents in war. Except for the United
                        States, all militarily important countries are parties to the Protocol.</p>
                    <p>The extensive hearings on the Protocol held by this committee in March 1971
                        examined the reasons why <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> ratification
                        of the Protocol has been so long delayed. In the interest of brevity, I
                        shall not go back over this record now, although I would, of course, be
                        happy to respond to any questions regarding the history of the Protocol.</p>
                    <p rend="center">INTERAGENCY REVIEW OF PROTOCOL’S SCOPE</p>
                    <p>During the 1971 hearings, differing views were expressed on the question of
                        including riot control agents and herbicides within the scope of the
                        Protocol. As a result, the committee requested that the executive branch
                        reexamine its interpretation of the Protocol’s scope.<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d104fn4">Ibid., 1971, pp. 215–218. [Footnote is in the

                    <p>In response to the committee’s request, the executive branch has undertaken a
                        comprehensive review. We have reconsidered our legal interpretation and
                        analyzed possible alternatives for resolving differences of opinion on the
                        scope of the Protocol. We have evaluated the military utility of riot
                        control agents and herbicides. And we have, of course, carefully considered
                        alternative approaches that would accomplish our arms control
                        objectives.</p>
                    <p rend="center">PRESIDENT’S DECISIONS CONCERNING PROTOCOL’S SCOPE</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chairman, the President considers it important that the United States
                        ratify the Geneva Protocol at the earliest possible date. On the basis of an
                        interagency review he has very recently taken decisions with a view to
                        achieving Senate advice and consent to ratification. The President has
                        authorized me to announce those decisions today.</p>
                    <p>The President has authorized me to state on his behalf that he is prepared,
                        in reaffirming the current <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        understanding of the scope of the Protocol, to renounce as a matter of
                        national policy:</p>
                    <p>(1) first use of herbicides in war except use, under regulations applicable
                        to their domestic use, for control of vegetation within <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> bases and installations or around their
                        immediate defensive perimeters;</p>
                    <p>(2) first use of riot control agents in war except in defensive military
                        modes to save lives such as:</p>
                    <p>(a) Use of riot control agents in riot control circumstances to include
                        controlling rioting prisoners of war. This exception would permit use of
                        riot control agents in riot situations in areas under direct and distinct
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military control;</p>
                    <p>(b) Use of riot control agents in situations where civilian casualties can be
                        reduced or avoided. This use would be restricted to situations in which
                        civilians are used to mask or screen attacks;</p>
                    <p>(c) Use of riot control agents in rescue missions. The use of riot control
                        agents would be permissible in the recovery of remotely isolated personnel
                        such as downed aircrews—and passengers;</p>
                    <p>(d) Use of riot control agents in rear echelon areas outside the combat zone
                        to protect convoys from civil disturbances, terrorists, and paramilitary
                        organizations.</p>
                    <p>The President intends to conform <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy
                        to this position, assuming the Senate consents.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the President, under an earlier directive still in force, must
                        approve in advance any use of riot control agents and chemical herbicides in
                        war.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chairman, I believe that you may have several specific questions
                        concerning this policy. I would be happy to respond to such questions at
                        this time, before I proceed to the section of my statement dealing with the
                        Biological Weapons Convention.</p>
                    <pb n="339" facs="0373" xml:id="pg_339"/>
                    <p rend="center">BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION OF 1972</p>
                    <p>The second agreement before the committee is the Biological Weapons
                        Convention of 1972. The full title is the Convention on Prohibition of the
                        Development, Production, and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and
                        Toxin Weapons and Their Destruction. As the title suggests, this convention
                        completely prohibits biological and toxin weapons. Since it provides for the
                        elimination of existing weapons, it is a true disarmament measure.</p>
                    <p>The convention is entirely consistent with <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> policy concerning biological and toxin weapons, since the
                        United States had already unilaterally renounced these weapons before the
                        convention was negotiated. In fact, our entire stockpile of biological and
                        toxin agents and weapons has already been destroyed. Our biological warfare
                        facilities have been converted to peaceful uses.</p>
                    <p>Since opening the convention for signature in April 1972, 110 nations have
                        become signatories. This includes all members of the Warsaw Pact and all
                        members of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> except France. In order
                        for this treaty to come into force, it must be ratified by the three
                        depositories—the United States, the United Kingdom, and the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>—and at least 19 other countries. Enough
                        countries have now ratified, some 36, so that only ratification by
                        depositories is still required. The British have completed all the
                        parliamentary procedures for ratification and the Soviet Union has announced
                        that it intends to ratify before the end of 1974. It is particularly
                        important that <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> ratification be
                        accomplished in the near future so that we will not be the ones who prevent
                        this treaty from coming into force.</p>
                    <p rend="center">VERIFICATION AND <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> INTEREST
                        IN ENTRY</p>
                    <p>There is one aspect of the convention to which I would like to give
                        particular attention: the question of verification. Verification of
                        compliance with this convention in countries with relatively closed
                        societies is difficult, particularly for the prohibition of the development
                        of these weapons.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, in our judgment it is in the net interest of the United States
                        to enter into this convention, basically for three reasons:</p>
                    <p>First, the military utility of these weapons is dubious at best; the effects
                        are unpredictable and potentially uncontrollable, and there exists no
                        military experience concerning them. Hence, the prohibitions of this
                        convention do not deny us a militarily viable option and verifiability is
                        therefore less important.</p>
                    <p>Second, biological weapons are particularly repugnant from a moral point of
                        view.</p>
                    <p>Third, widespread adherence to the convention can help discourage some
                        misguided competition in biological weapons.</p>
                    <pb n="340" facs="0374" xml:id="pg_340"/>
                    <p>It is to be feared that, without such a prohibition, new developments in the
                        biological sciences might give rise to concern because they could be abused
                        for weapons purposes. Such anxieties could foster secretive military
                        competition in a field of science that would otherwise remain open to
                        international cooperation and be used solely for the benefit of mankind.</p>
                    <p>It is important, however, that the limited verifiability of this convention
                        should not be misconstrued as a precedent for other arms limitation
                        agreements where these special conditions would not obtain.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chairman, the administration believes that the Biological Weapons
                        Convention represents a useful arms control measure. We hope the United
                        States will not prevent the treaty from entering into force through its
                        failure to ratify. By failing to ratify, we would deny ourselves the benefit
                        of having other countries legally committed not to produce weapons that we
                        have already given up. And we would deny 109 other countries the benefit of
                        a treaty that they have already signed.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_GDV_1">Giscard</persName>: I want to explore the
                        Non-Proliferation Treaty. You have a meeting in April 1975. Our position has
                        been not to join it but to follow the rules of it. We see that a number of
                        countries which earlier thought to join it have not done so. Does that
                        change your approach?</p>
                    <p>President: For us to back off would not be understood in the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, and the Congress is strongly for the
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>. We would urge an exporters
                        conference.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GDV_1">Giscard</persName>: This is on nuclear
                        materials.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, it is a separate
                        matter from the Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>
                    <p>President: We are worried about the lack of safeguards of some exporters. If
                        the suppliers could meet outside the treaty perhaps, it would be useful.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GDV_1">Giscard</persName>: You made a step by
                        suggesting it a month ago.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, we held off for
                        you.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GDV_1">Giscard</persName>: And the Soviet Union?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: They have agreed in
                        principle.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GDV_1">Giscard</persName>: We are cautious. In
                        principle, I share the idea of participation. We must not take it
                        highhandedly. We are wary of the mechanism because of the experience of the
                            <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss>. There were a lot of problems
                        with it, sometimes absurd. There was an electronic sale to Poland which took
                        three years to get through <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What we have in mind is
                        not <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss>. That was just a ban on
                        strategic materials and each case was determined separately. Here we would
                        agree on safeguards, and then all of us could sell all the reactors they can
                        without further reference to any central authority.</p>
                    <p>President: We want uniform rules only.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, we don’t want a body
                        to license reactors. We would set up the rules and then let each country
                        make its own sales decision.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Sauvagnargues</persName>: There have been
                        contacts. We are studying the <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1"
                            >Ingersoll</persName> proposal but we are wary of an international body
                        with strong controls. Also we have relations with your <gloss
                            target="#t_AEC_1">AEC</gloss> on a bilateral approach.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: <persName
                            corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName> is our position. <persName

                        problem at all. We have those in our bureaucracy who are passionate on
                        nonproliferation. We have resisted Soviet pressure on the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>. On safeguards, we are prepared for
                        preliminary talks with you beforehand so there are no surprises. <pb n="342"
                            facs="0376" xml:id="pg_342"/>We just don’t want competition in

                    <p>President: We have transferred Dixy to State!</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: So she will be under
                        moderate control. [They talked about Dixy a bit.] Seriously, we will sit
                        down with your experts to work out the specifics.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Sauvagnargues</persName>: In other words X would
                        agree not to sell unless the buyers agree to the agreed safeguards.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Mrs. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GI_1">Gandhi</persName> said she would agree, but
                        multilaterally not bilaterally. She said there would otherwise be pressure
                        in the Middle East.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_GDV_1">Giscard</persName>: Do you think it is possible
                        to limit the flow of nuclear materials?</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I think we can slow it
                        down.</p>

                    <p>President: Have the Canadians agreed?</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. We thought we might
                        call a conference.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You don’t have to be in
                        the Non Proliferation Treaty to participate in a suppliers conference. We
                        don’t think many more will join the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>. We
                        don’t think we need that for a suppliers conference.</p>

                        But countries don’t have to sign the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> to
                        join this. The Soviet Union has persistently sought to engage us in joint

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Someone must administer
                        the safeguards. The Vienna group is OK. We don’t have to have a new setup.
                        India will join multilaterally, but not to safeguards applied just to them.
                        We are worried that India may start selling materials.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The President has directed that a reexamination be made of issues associated
                        with a shift to private ownership of future <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> uranium enrichment capacity. Present capacity resides in
                        three government plants. Their capacity is fully committed under contract
                        and they are anticipated to continue to be owned and operated by the
                        government for the foreseeable future. The request for a restudy of issues
                        on the approach to capacity expansion is incorporated in a letter of

                    </p>
                    <p>The supply of uranium enrichment services to meet future needs for nuclear
                        fuel, domestic and foreign, requires a major and continuing expansion of
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> capacity. The planned government
                        capacity of 27 million units per year and associated preproduction stocks
                        will permit meeting all defined <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> needs
                        and that portion of foreign needs contracting with the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> for nuclear power plants initially
                        requiring services through the early 1980s. Projections indicate that
                        thereafter new increments of enrichment capacity averaging about 6 million
                        units per year each will be required to come into operation in the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> each year through about the end of the
                        century. Financial, manpower, or other possible resource constraints do not
                        appear to present barriers to the availability of these levels of enrichment
                        capacity.</p>
                    <p>The thrust of present policy is to look to the private sector to assume
                        responsibility for expansion of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        enrichment capacity. This policy is based primarily upon domestic
                        considerations, including <pb n="345" facs="0379" xml:id="pg_345"/>avoidance
                        of net government expenditures of $7–9 billion through 1985 which further
                        construction of Government capacity would involve. It also recognizes that
                        the provision of new production plant capacity, in other areas of the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> economy, is normally a private sector
                        responsibility; there are many functions which only the government can
                        perform, but uranium enrichment is not one of them.</p>
                    <p>The present policy is targeted at achieving substantial financial commitments
                        by <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> firms to new capacity over the
                        coming year. A number of firms are contemplating such commitments.
                        Achievement of private entry under the present government strategy is
                        believed possible and, according to the <gloss target="#t_AEC_1"
                        >AEC</gloss>, likely, although by no means assured.</p>
                    <p>A complex four-way negotiation is in process between the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government, industry, financing sources,
                        and electrical utility customers to establish the risks and responsibilities
                        to be assumed by each party in connection with the first private plants. At
                        the same time, the planned capacity of the existing government plants is
                        fully committed under contract. Accordingly, there is uncertainty on the
                        part of potential foreign and domestic customers as to the character and
                        timing of expansion of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> capacity, the
                        terms and conditions under which future <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        enriching services will be offered, and by whom. This is particularly so
                        since the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has ceased long-term
                        contracting for the supply of enrichment services, pending decisions by
                        potential private suppliers. In the interim, foreign customers have received
                        Presidential assurances that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> will
                        meet future foreign contractual needs. Foreign customers, however, would
                        clearly prefer the ability to contract as compared to receiving assurances
                        that future <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> capacity will be available
                        for them.</p>
                    <p>The current “contracting gap” in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is
                        contributing to substantial international strains. Foreign customers are
                        increasingly motivated by the existence of delay and uncertainty in the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to seek supply elsewhere, to
                        initiate or expand their own <gloss target="#t_RD_1">R&amp;D</gloss> and
                        construction programs, to enter into enrichment supply alliances or to take
                        other actions which could be detrimental to <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> foreign policy and economic interests. In addition to
                        affecting political relations generally, <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> enrichment services contribute to our energy cooperation,
                        nonproliferation, and balance of payments objectives. Hence, it is in the
                        strong international and economic policy interest of the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to achieve an early commitment to increase
                        capacity in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                    </p>
                    <p>If the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> were to go on for a protracted
                        period, implying uncertainty as to its interest or ability to pursue the
                        foreign market, economic advantages in the form of enrichment and, possibly,
                        nuclear reactors sales might well be lost, along with any associated
                        international political benefits. Any losses would be difficult to regain
                        even with a more aggressive market stance later.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> enrichment policy has played and will
                        continue to play an important role in our efforts to limit the further
                        spread of nuclear <pb n="346" facs="0380" xml:id="pg_346"/>weapons. Our
                        position as a commercially attractive supplier of enrichment services has
                        given us leverage to obtain appropriate safeguards and nonproliferation
                        guarantees on our exports and to make dependence on us for periodic
                        refueling of nuclear power plants a factor that helps enforce such
                        undertakings. Foreign commitments to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        fuel supply enable us to impose safeguards and controls over foreign nuclear
                        programs even if the reactors are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> of American
                        origin, through the required Agreement for Cooperation.</p>
                    <p>The United States is engrossed in establishing strong links among major
                        energy consuming nations to reduce their dependency on imported oil. Part of
                        the consumer nation strategy is to establish nuclear power as an alternative
                        to oil and the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has offered to assist in
                        the construction of multilateral enrichment facilities to provide the fuel
                        for nuclear power plants abroad. Maintaining our position as a leader in the
                        enrichment field will be an important factor in enlisting the support of
                        other nations on energy cooperation programs, in the International Energy
                        Agency and other forums.</p>
                    <p>Somewhat over three years ago the <gloss target="#t_AEC_1">AEC</gloss>
                        initiated steps to give industry access to the classified aspects of the
                        gaseous diffusion (used in the existing government plants) and centrifuge
                        (developmental) technologies.</p>
                    <p>One of the participating groups, Uranium Enrichment Associates (<gloss
                            target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss>), presently headed by the Bechtel
                        Corporation with other participants not yet identified, is prepared to make
                        the earliest commitment to construction of large scale private capacity.
                            <gloss target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss> had announced that it was prepared
                        and expected to be able to reach a decision before the end of this calendar
                        year on proceeding to construct a new 9 million unit gaseous diffusion plant
                        at a projected cost of nearly 3 billion dollars in 1974 dollars. This plant
                        would be operating in the early to mid-1980s.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss> is now negotiating contract details
                        with customers. These include arrangements involving foreign equity
                        participation in the <gloss target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss> plant (but do not
                        include foreign access to classified <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        technology). In addition to Japan, these include discussions in process with
                        Iran and Germany. The remaining problems in the ongoing negotiations center
                        around the reluctance of many domestic utilities to accept proposed contract
                        terms and conditions suggested by <gloss target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss> and
                        the hesitancy of foreign customers to act in advance of <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> domestic utilities to commit themselves to
                        contracts with <gloss target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>While <gloss target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss> has selected a near-term
                        commitment to diffusion as its approach, other companies in the program have
                        indicated a preference to pursue centrifuge technology. Because of the
                        status of the centrifuge technology, firm commitments to large plants are
                        not likely to be made until several years from now. However, the companies
                        involved have indicated the feasibility of committing to the construc<pb
                            n="347" facs="0381" xml:id="pg_347"/>tion of small Demonstration
                        Centrifuge Enrichment Facilities (<gloss target="#t_DCEF_1">DCEF</gloss>’s)
                        within the coming year. This is being pursued under a government program
                        involving government financial assistance to joint industry-utility customer
                        projects through government subsidization of the cost of the enriching
                        services during the demonstration phase of the project.</p>
                    <p>Additional government assistance has been offered to all potential private
                        entrants primarily involving (1) availability of government stocks of
                        enriched uranium to back-stop the early years of operation of private plants
                        and (2) availability of government expertise to help assure reliability of
                        plant performance.</p>
                    <p>However, industry still faces substantial risks and uncertainties in
                        contemplating private entry because of the large financial investments
                        required, the limited time available for transfer of the classified
                        technology from government to industry, uncertainty as to government actions
                        with respect to licensing, including possible economic regulation, and
                        because most of the interested companies prefer a newer enrichment
                        technology (centrifuge) still under development and therefore having higher
                        associated technological risks.</p>
                    <p>Thus, from the domestic standpoint, there has also been a recognition that,
                        if the attempt to achieve an adequate private entry were to fail, it would
                        be necessary for the government to assume the responsibility of providing
                        additional enrichment capacity. This view is taken because of the benefits
                        perceived nationally for a shift to nuclear power—economic, environmental,
                        and national security (reduces dependencies on foreign energy
                        resources).</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, in testimony before the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, on
                        August 6, 1974, Chairman <persName corresp="#p_RDL_1">Dixy Lee

                    <quote>
                        <p>“The choice, however, is not between private supply or lack of it . .

                        <p>“Private plans exist which can, over the course of the coming year, lead
                            to commitments to new enrichment capacity. Government planning can be

                            expectations . . .”</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>Based on planning statements of the Department of Defense, a portion of the
                        continuing capacity of the existing three government enrichment plants has
                        been allocated to meet future national security needs. Needs not presently
                        foreseen can be met by reprogramming government-owned resources (materials
                        and facilities) or from new capacity (including purchase from new private
                        capacity) if adequate advance notice of such need is given. Under emergency
                        conditions, the diversion of enriched uranium from civilian uses to meet
                        critical national security needs would be a government option under all
                        policy alternatives considered in this study. The retention of present

                        policy to ensure adequate enrichment capacity for both domestic and foreign
                        needs concerns the mode of ownership of enrichment facilities that will have
                        to be constructed in the future. Specific decisions to be made at this
                        juncture are related to three basic policy alternatives which could be
                        followed in seeking to provide future enrichment capacity:</p>

                        <p>c. <hi rend="italic">Abandon</hi> the objective of private entry into the

                    </quote>
                    <p>As will be discussed below, differing organizational arrangements could be
                        implemented to carry forward each of these policy approaches. The choice of
                        organizational arrangement may depend, to a certain extent, on the approach
                        adopted for providing future enrichment capacity; to a lesser degree,
                        available organizational options could influence decisions regarding the
                        preferred policy approach. In any event the decision on the current approach
                        should reflect a view both on the strategy to achieve capacity expansion and
                        the associated government organization to carry out the government’s
                        responsibilities under the strategy.</p>
                    <p>The decision to select one of these courses of action should be made now.
                        This will allow a sufficient period for modifying or reaffirming present
                        policy in order to assure that the decision to construct the next increment
                        of capacity will be taken in time to meet demand and to set in motion
                        contingency plans and longer-range programs which would serve domestic and
                        foreign policy purposes.</p>
                    <p>Alternative A is predicated on the view that private entry remains a
                        desirable and viable objective and that this goal can and should be pursued
                        through June 1975, at which time, if not achieved, another approach will be
                        required.</p>
                    <p>Alternative B does not challenge the desirability of private entry as such
                        but is based on the premise that the likelihood of success in achieving
                        private entry for the next two increments of capacity is low and that
                        further delay in taking positive actions to assure new near-term capacity
                        would be unwise.</p>
                    <pb n="349" facs="0383" xml:id="pg_349"/>
                    <p>Alternative C is based on the premise that private enrichment is basically
                        less desirable than continuing government responsibility and should not be
                        sought in either the near-term or the long-term.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Alternative A. Persevere in Seeking Private Entry</p>
                    <p>This approach entails the continuance of present programs designed to
                        accomplish the objective of all new enrichment capacity being provided by
                        the private sector. As such, it may require the consideration of further
                        government action—initially by <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss> and
                        possibly later by a successor entity—in order to accomplish this goal, above
                        and beyond the technology transfer and financial assistance programs already
                        in existence. However, it is clear that this approach could not be followed
                        indefinitely without substantial near-term progress since the mutual goals
                        of international credibility and assurance of supply would be compromised.
                        As a result, this approach can only be pursued for a defined period of time
                        (until June 30, 1975) while recognizing the possible need for implementing a
                        contingency plan, such as Alternative B, for <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1"
                            >ERDA</gloss> to construct the fourth and fifth plants if private entry
                        fails to materialize in time.</p>
                    <p>Additional <gloss target="#t_AEC_1">AEC</gloss> assistance might be required
                        to bring private centrifuge plants into being, given the risks associated
                        with exploiting such a new technology. There is, however, an immediate need
                        to facilitate a positive industrial decision on a fourth gaseous diffusion
                        plant. This has led to plans to formulate an expanded program of assistance
                        in support of the <gloss target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss> activity. Two sets of
                        additional supportive actions are being considered in an attempt to remove
                        the remaining obstacles to a final <gloss target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss>
                        commitment which stem primarily from the reluctance of many domestic
                        utilities to accept proposed contract terms and conditions suggested by
                            <gloss target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss> and the hesitancy of foreign
                        customers to act in advance of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> domestic
                        utilities to commit themselves to contracts with <gloss target="#t_UEA_1"
                            >UEA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The first <gloss target="#t_AEC_1">AEC</gloss> action plan has been to
                        identify a “closure package” which would not require legislative action in
                        order to enable <gloss target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss> to make a commitment.
                        The elements of such a package might include such measures as <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government contracting commitments to
                        purchase <gloss target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss> services in order to trigger
                        similar decisions by <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and foreign
                        customers, and a Presidential level statement to provide assurance that the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government would take those steps
                        necessary to insure completion and operation of the plant should
                        difficulties arise prior to initial plant operation. This package could
                        potentially be defined by the end of February, 1975. Thus, before June of
                        next year, it would be known whether closure could be reached with utility
                        customers on the basis of these or similar actions enabling <gloss
                            target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss> to make a formal commitment to
                        proceed.</p>
                    <pb n="350" facs="0384" xml:id="pg_350"/>
                    <p>A second <gloss target="#t_AEC_1">AEC</gloss> action plan, being pursued in
                        parallel, which could be applied if the first approach was not sufficient to
                        facilitate positive <gloss target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss> customer action,
                        would involve defining an even more powerful closure package requiring
                        legislative authority. This package might include such measures as a loan
                        guarantee to <gloss target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss> making the government
                        responsible for the debt in the event the project failed, or alternatively,
                        an agreement by the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government to take
                        over and complete the private enrichment facility (along with its supporting
                        enrichment customer contracts) in the event of private failure to achieve
                        successful completion. This would assure utilities that their contractual
                        needs would actually be met in the 1980s. This approach would require
                        identification of the elements of the package and agreement among the
                        Executive, <gloss target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss> and utility customers as to
                        their adequacy by June 30, 1975. In addition there should be assurance,
                        through consultation, of favorable congressional reaction to avoid risk of
                        delay or failure to achieve passage of legislation by September.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Alternative B. Defer Private Entry</p>
                    <p>Under this approach, legislative authority would be sought for <gloss
                            target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss> to construct the fourth full-scale
                        diffusion plant and a smaller centrifuge facility. Existing programs
                        designed to encourage and facilitate the subsequent entry of the private
                        sector into the enrichment industry would be maintained. Further efforts may
                        have to be considered by the government in order to ultimately achieve the
                        objective of private construction of future plants. Alternative C (below)
                        would become the backup approach in the event private entry is not
                        ultimately achieved.</p>

                        capacity is estimated to be September 1, 1975. The <gloss target="#t_AEC_1"
                            >AEC</gloss> has continued design studies and other contingency planning
                        actions so that the government option could be exercised in this time frame
                        if desired and to permit Government contracting to be resumed once a
                        decision to build has been made.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Alternative C. Abandon Private Entry Objective</p>
                    <p>A decision could be made to abandon the goal of private entry and maintain

                        to be a need to establish a private centrifuge manufacturing capability but

                        technology and expertise to the private sector would be terminated.</p>
                    <p>Selection of this alternative would require a deliberate decision to be made
                        in early 1975 to seek authority for <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss>
                        to construct the fourth enrichment plant to meet immediate contracting needs

                        would be followed subsequently by construction of a large-scale government
                        centrifuge facility. The plants would ultimately be constructed either by

                        organizational alternative given the task of providing long-term capacity

                    <p>The primary reason for establishment of a directorate would be to give it a

                        of enrichment services to the private sector and to foreign customers. One
                        of its principal objectives could be to facilitate private entry into the
                        enrichment field by continuing to provide technical and financial assistance
                        to prospective entrants. It would be neither authorized to nor be excluded
                        from construction of new enrichment capacity. Financing of the operation of
                        the directorate would include the use of a revolving fund for revenues and
                        appropriations which would provide the source of funds for operation,
                        construction and assistance activities. If costs exceeded revenues,
                        appropriations would be obtained from the Federal Government through the
                        conventional budget process.</p>
                    <p>The creation of a directorate appears to be necessary regardless of whether
                        encouragement, deferral, or abandonment of private entry is selected from
                        among the options previously outlined. However, the directorate could be
                        considered either as the permanent form of government organization or as an
                        intermediate organization leading to the creation of a new government
                        corporation (alternative 4) as the permanent entity.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Corporation</hi>. An alternative approach for obtaining
                        business-like, efficient government operation of the enrichment function in
                        a context of policy responsiveness is the design and creation of a new
                        policy responsive government corporation. It would differ from the
                        directorate primarily in its method of financing, in that it would seek
                        capital by selling bonds to the Treasury or to the private sector, by
                        permitting equity investment, or by a mixture of these. Two possible
                        alternatives for a corporation structure are a wholly owned government
                        corporation or a mixed government/private corporation. Wholly owned
                        corporations are better understood, but, in principle, either form could be
                        designed to incorporate desirable features such as self-financing,
                        business-like operations, policy responsiveness, and attracting foreign
                        participants. The details of such a corporation could not be delineated
                        during the course of this study. Therefore, if this organizational mode <pb
                            n="353" facs="0387" xml:id="pg_353"/>is believed to be a viable
                        alternative to the directorate for the future, a more extensive effort would
                        need to be made to define its structure.</p>
                    <p>In comparing the directorate approach with that of a corporation, emphasis is
                        placed on the fact that the creation of a directorate could proceed at
                        once—that is, as soon as a determination were made that it would be needed
                        to meet the government’s varied objectives. The corporation, on the other
                        hand, could not be created without the passage of legislation, in itself a
                        time-consuming event. Furthermore, as noted above, the drafting of
                        legislation would require considerable thought and time. The earliest
                        opportunity to present legislation would be about June, 1975. Passage of
                        legislation, with the attendant risk that Congress would modify it contrary
                        to the wishes of the administration, would require an additional
                        indeterminate period of time.</p>
                    <p>It would be possible in early <gloss target="#t_CY_1">CY</gloss> 1975 to
                        select a government corporation as the vehicle to eventually implement
                        whichever policy approach is chosen. The <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1"
                            >ERDA</gloss> directorate, as noted, could then perform necessary
                        government functions in the near-term until these activities could be
                        transferred to a corporation.</p>
                    <p>Resumption of government contracting for enrichment services by the
                        Government could begin after obtaining mandatory congressional review (no
                        legislation is required) if it is determined that either the directorate or
                        a corporation is to form the long-term medium for provision of enrichment
                        services domestically and abroad through continued contracting and
                        construction of new capacity.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Organizational Issues</hi>. In comparing alternative
                        government organizational options, the following set of key issues have been
                        identified which are of significance in assessing the relative ability of
                        each option to implement a particular policy approach. Each issue is
                        explained and discussed briefly below.</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Policy responsiveness</hi>. Whatever policy approach is
                        chosen, there is agreement that the government enrichment entity should
                        operate in a business-like manner but that it should also be responsive to
                        national policies, particularly in the fields of general energy,
                        international affairs and national security. The <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1"
                            >ERDA</gloss> directorate should be adequately responsive. While the
                            <persName corresp="#p_HC_1">Hosmer</persName> corporation is deficient
                        in this regard, a policy responsive corporation would, by definition, be
                        designed to be responsive. However, there could be problems in reaching
                        agreement within the Executive and with the Congress as to the most
                        appropriate mechanisms to achieve this.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Source of Financing</hi>. The directorate concept
                        includes a revolving fund, with excesses of revenues compared to costs
                        returned to the Treasury and annual deficits (expected in the first 5 years
                        even without new capacity expansion) met through new appropriations.
                        Although a formal revolving fund would require legislative authorization, a
                        de facto revolving fund could be established administratively pending
                        passage of such legislation. This would be an improvement over the <pb
                            n="354" facs="0388" xml:id="pg_354"/>present situation under which
                        enrichment revenues are credited not against enrichment costs but against
                        total agency appropriations. Net funding needs by the directorate would be
                        requested through the congressional appropriations process and be treated as
                        direct Federal outlays impacting on the budget. All government corporation
                        concepts involve authority for the corporation to borrow funds from the
                        private money market or, alternatively, to borrow from the Treasury.
                        Regardless of the source of funds, the net outlays of the corporation would
                        be included in Federal fiscal totals while, at the same time, these
                        expenditures would be made without being subject to normal Presidential and
                        congressional fiscal controls associated with the annual appropriations
                        process. The resulting fiscal independence enhances the capability of the
                        corporation to carry out its programs, but can complicate the problem of
                        insuring the policy responsiveness which is otherwise desired, as noted
                        earlier.</p>

                            Activities</hi>. It does not appear feasible to completely separate from
                            <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss> all of the activities related to
                        or impinging upon enrichment. Some key related matters include
                        classification and materials control policies, activities relating to
                        natural uranium availability, enriched uranium transactions with <gloss
                            target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>, and other international energy
                        cooperation activities. The <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss>
                        directorate permits issues in these areas to be addressed by a single Agency
                        head. All corporation concepts would generate a new set of problems by
                        introducing an additional entity into interagency decisions on <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> enrichment policy matters.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Timely Assurance</hi>. Actions involving the creation of
                        a new entity might introduce a lengthy period of uncertainty and delay
                        pending final passage of the needed legislation. Problems associated with
                        lame-duck leadership might arise in the interim, depending upon how
                        different the new concept is in its top policy making structure from that
                        previously in existence. There is also a risk that the final product might
                        differ in some significant respect, because of congressional action, from
                        the original Executive conception. These difficulties may be particularly
                        acute for the establishment of a corporation. The directorate could be
                        emplaced by the <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss> administrator without
                        legislation. However, it might be desirable to have it subsequently
                        validated by a legislative action. It should be noted that the internal
                        Agency aspects of the associated revolving fund could also be put into force
                        immediately by administrative action on the part of the <gloss
                            target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss> administrator although legislative
                        authority would be required to bring it fully into effect.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Existing Plants</hi>. A special problem exists in the
                            <persName corresp="#p_HC_1">Hosmer</persName> corporation legislation in
                        that it contemplates the disposition of the existing government plants to
                        private industry. This study finds that such action is presently undesirable
                        and would not contemplate such authority or action either by the directorate
                        or the policy responsive corporation—both of which would assume
                        responsibility for the existing plants.</p>
                    <pb n="355" facs="0389" xml:id="pg_355"/>
                    <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Operability</hi>. There is a question as to whether any
                        new entity would be structurally able to fulfill its intended mission
                        effectively. Major congressional legislative action might produce
                        compromises which would impair the structure of the resulting organization.
                        Alternatively, the original concept might ultimately prove defective and
                        require revision (assuming that the action was in fact reversible) which, if
                        further legislation were required, might prove difficult. The directorate
                        concept appears somewhat more flexible in this regard than do other
                        approaches.</p>

                        which can be used to evaluate the relative responsiveness of alternative
                        approaches to these two sets of considerations.</p>

                        enrichment capacity is required to support the projected growth of nuclear

                        this century. The projected growth rate must be maintained if nuclear power
                        is to make its essential contribution to achieving national energy
                        objectives. An early commitment to the first increment of new <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> enrichment capacity using diffusion
                        technology would help to establish the needed climate of confidence among
                        domestic utilities that fuel will be available to meet the requirements of
                        their reactor programs. But it is at least equally important that the
                        question of long-term supply be satisfactorily resolved.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Organization of uranium enrichment processing on a
                            competitive industrial basis</hi>. The physical processing of natural
                        uranium into enriched uranium for use in nuclear power reactors is a highly
                        capital-intensive activity utilizing sophisticated technology. The process
                        is essentially industrial in nature. It is, therefore, appropriate to
                        organize this process on an industrial basis in order to secure the benefits
                        of flexible management, receptivity to innovation, and responsiveness to the
                        market. The introduction of contrifuge technology will permit enrichment
                        plants to operate economically on a smaller scale than is possible with the
                        diffusion process. This technology could permit a number of independent
                        enrichment enterprises to come into being and to compete with one another.
                        Transfer of uranium enrichment to the private sector would place the
                        responsibility for determining the rate of expansion of enrichment capacity
                        on free capital markets, where the requirements of the enrichment sector
                        would be weighed along with competing demands for capital originating

                        be $7–9 billion. Over the long-term (i.e., the 1990s), since government
                        would operate the business, at minimum, on a cost recovery basis, it would
                        break even or generate a surplus.</p>

                        services for the life of a power plant under favorable terms contributes to

                        abroad, and can thus indirectly serve to increase revenues from that source.
                        It should be borne in mind that opportunities for foreign investment in

                        revenues and reduce capital outlays needed to construct new capacity.
                        Similarly, multilateral enrichment plants built abroad with <gloss

                        consequences abroad if permitted to persist even until the middle of next
                        year. The ability of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to restore

                        assuring long-term enrichment supplies, the crucial aspect from a foreign
                        policy standpoint is not our own confidence in the success of any selected

                        seems to be more of an issue than price and contract terms. The price of

                        remain roughly competitive with that charged by other suppliers under any of

                    <p>President: Happy New Year.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: I have a bit of good news. The
                        Senate has ratified the Geneva Protocol. A signing ceremony would show that
                        the Legislature and Executive are now cooperating.</p>
                    <p>Another issue: The danger of nuclear proliferation. The Congress is very
                        worried. Brazil, Argentina, Pakistan, Libya all may be looking around. South
                        Korea also. A number of efforts are under way. We are trying to deal with
                        the export of nuclear materials. Action is slow because the French are
                        obnoxious.</p>
                    <p>What this comes down to is a number of hard decisions which may come at a
                        price. For example, the Italians are holding back from signing the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>. Some never will sign. But if it begins to
                        unravel we could be accused of not doing enough.</p>
                    <p>President: How many potentials have not signed?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Most of them. But if we could
                        show motion with Italy, it might keep a sense of momentum.</p>
                    <p>President: What nuclear powers haven’t signed?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: France and the <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>. But the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                            >PRC</gloss> has not exported material. I bring this up to show that
                        things have to be done. We are preparing a package for you of things which
                        have to be done.</p>
                    <p>President: I think the success of getting the Senate to move was excellent
                        and I congratulate you. I haven’t focused on a signing ceremony.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GDV_1">Giscard</persName> seemed forthcoming on this
                        at Martinique.</p>
                    <pb n="362" facs="0396" xml:id="pg_362"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SBA_1">Scowcroft</persName>: Their team is coming next
                        week. We don’t know what they’re coming with.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: But maybe if they won’t join a
                        conference we can work with them bilaterally. But France is preparing to
                        export reprocessing plants, and there is no way to prevent diversion of
                        materials from these.</p>
                    <p>President: Do they have the technical people—Israel, Pakistan, etc.?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: They are developing it, and
                        the expertise is transferable from other (such as reactor) areas.</p>
                    <p>President: What do we do now?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: We must develop proper
                        safeguards, such as we have in the export of reactors to Israel and
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>President: What do they think of Vladivostok?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: They think the dropping of
                            <gloss target="#t_FBS_1">FBS</gloss> was real progress. Some of them
                        want the levels brought down and additional limitations added. Most of them
                        feel this is a turning point. It will be important as we flesh out the
                        treaty to deal with verification. We can’t be trapped into promising
                        absolute verification, but within limits. If we promise further
                        negotiations, that will be important in getting the academics on board.</p>
                    <p>President: But first we must get this one signed. I think the opposition is
                        dying, isn’t it?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Several of them want to know
                        how much we will save.</p>
                    <p>President: If the sense-of-the-Senate resolution about renegotiating goes
                        through, I will tell the Senators they should add a clause promising the
                        five to ten billion dollars that will be necessary if they destroy the
                        agreement by forcing a renegotiation.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: In the last analysis, few of
                        them will want to destroy the agreement. Do you have time for a minute on
                            <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss>?</p>
                    <p>President: Yes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: The talks are somewhat
                        stalemated. There are three key elements: One, the nuclear package. It
                        shouldn’t follow too closely on Vladivostok. But the <persName
                            corresp="#p_NS_1">Nunn</persName> amendment requires the Secretary of
                        Defense to report on reductions in overseas nuclear deployment. Two, the
                        Soviet pressure for European reductions. Three, the connection with <gloss
                            target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss>. It would look bad if there were no
                        progress in <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss>. While there is no formal
                        coupling, there is an informal political coupling. We don’t care about
                            <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss>, but we do care about <gloss
                            target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss>. It would be embarrassing if one moves
                        without the other.</p>
                    <p>President: Is <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss> stalemated?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: We do have tentative agreement
                        on adding air manpower. We may be able to combine stages one and two into
                        one, to help the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. In the last
                        analysis, if there is no agreement, we should have at least made a proposal
                        that is convincing to the Congress.</p>
                    <pb n="363" facs="0397" xml:id="pg_363"/>
                    <p>President: I think the new House will be worse than the last. It would be bad
                        to be forced to give something without getting anything in return. With the
                        new Congress reconvening, we have to have a story of pushing hard.</p>
                    <p>Any change of attitude on the part of the Europeans?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: The Germans are not pushing
                        for reductions, but as you know, the Brits are. We have to be careful a
                        landslide doesn’t start, because Congress wants American, not European
                        reductions.</p>
                    <p>President: How about the Threshold Test Ban?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: The talks start in February.
                        The big issue is <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> above the threshold.
                        It has implications for the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>. As a
                        personal judgment, if we can’t get <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>
                        restricted to below the threshold, we may not want to sign the TTB and
                        submit it to Congress. The Soviets probably wouldn’t want it submitted if it
                        would be defeated.</p>
                    <p>President: I appreciate your bringing me up to date. I hope we can give Resor
                        some forthcoming recommendations. It would be a disaster to have to give
                        things away without getting anything in return.</p>
                    <p>Thanks for coming in. Keep me posted through <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"

                        influences our overall political relations with major countries and

                        how new enrichment capacity would be built, and because of the particularly
                        acute damage caused by the “contracting gap” which began last summer and
                        which continues to exacerbate our foreign policy problems in the areas
                        noted. Indeed, this created the situation which led the Department of State
                        to request an interagency study of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        enrichment policy.</p>
                    <p>Last August, the President publicly affirmed the intention of the United
                        States to remain a reliable source of enriched uranium fuel for foreign as
                        well as domestic users. To support this declaration, prompt action is now
                        needed to restore the credibility of the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> as a world supplier of enriched uranium services—not only
                        a firm decision to commit a fourth enrichment plant and begin contracting,
                        but also the development of a credible long-term program for achieving the
                        additional capacity to serve foreign and domestic markets on a
                        nondiscriminatory basis under competitive price and contract terms. This is
                        as much a political and psychological matter, involving perceptions and <pb
                            n="365" facs="0399" xml:id="pg_365"/>attitudes, as it is a technical
                        question of actually being in a position to supply fuel when needed.</p>
                    <p>It is equally important that our enrichment programs remain highly responsive
                        to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government policy in the critical
                        and dynamic fields of energy cooperation and nuclear nonproliferation. The
                        right decision at this time would complement and reinforce our international
                        energy policy actions and strengthen our negotiating position with other oil
                        consumers as we prepare for a producer-consumer dialogue. American proposals
                        for enhanced cooperation in nuclear fuel supply among members of the
                        International Energy Agency, which can show <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1"
                            >OPEC</gloss> that the industrialized nations intend to diminish their
                        dependency on oil, must be supported by an active <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> uranium enrichment effort carefully shaped by
                        policy-making authorities. Given the renewed risks of proliferation, there
                        is a need to assure that our international enriched uranium position
                        adequately supports national and multilateral attempts to prevent the
                        further spread of nuclear weapons, both by providing the vehicle for
                        instituting safeguards over foreign power programs and by creating leverage
                        through foreign dependence on <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> fuel
                        supply.</p>
                    <p>Demand projections based upon domestic needs indicate that a commitment to
                        construct the fourth gaseous diffusion plant should be made no later than
                        mid-1975 in order for the plant to provide fuel by 1982. An additional
                        six-month delay in resuming contracting would compound our international
                        problems, and any subsequent delay would have severely deleterious
                        consequences for <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> foreign policy
                        interests through extension of the “contract gap” for an intolerably long
                        period. Entirely apart from foreign policy, our domestic energy objectives
                        argue for the early need to establish a clear plan to provide enrichment
                        capacity. Stabilizing this vital component of the fuel cycle would
                        materially assist <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> utilities to move
                        forward with nuclear power plant projects on schedule.</p>
                    <p>The status and prospects of the <gloss target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss> private
                        industry effort aimed at building a fourth gaseous diffusion plant remain
                        highly uncertain. Despite its loss of partners, Bechtel continues to
                        persevere in this endeavor, but it has thus far failed to induce electrical
                        utilities in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and abroad to invest
                        in the plant or to negotiate final fuel contracts—partly because of the
                        stringent terms that <gloss target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss> has demanded and
                        partly because of the difficult financial position of many domestic
                        utilities. This situation has led to consideration of expanded programs of
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government assistance and assurance
                        to <gloss target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss> in an effort to make a private
                        commitment possible. However, it is far from certain that a feasible
                        “closure package” could be agreed upon to ensure a timely and positive
                            <gloss target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss> decision, particularly if crucial
                        elements of this assistance package require new legislation and major
                        government commitments.</p>
                    <pb n="366" facs="0400" xml:id="pg_366"/>
                    <p>The perceived benefits of establishing the private entry policy in 1971 were
                        obviously persuasive to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> decision makers
                        at that time and many arguments for continuing this policy can be made.
                        However, given the delays and difficulties experienced in seeking to
                        transfer responsibility for the next increments of enrichment capacity to
                        the private sector, it would seem reasonable at this stage to question the
                        advisability of the “privatization” policy as currently conceived. Four
                        issues warrant special consideration:</p>
                    <p>1. Although there is no guarantee of success, if we persevere in seeking
                        private entry, we might be able to achieve a <gloss target="#t_UEA_1"
                            >UEA</gloss> commitment by the end of June to build a fourth gaseous
                        diffusion plant. While this may be soon enough to avoid a supply gap, the
                        continued inability to resume contracting promptly would, as indicated,
                        further damage our foreign policy interests and weaken the ability of the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to maintain a sizeable share of the
                        foreign enrichment market. The immediate resumption of government
                        contracting above present plant capacity, pending <gloss target="#t_UEA_1"
                            >UEA</gloss>’s decision and with termination of these contracts in favor
                        of a private plant when committed, has been suggested as a means of ending
                        the “contracting gap.” However, even if this step were approved by Congress,
                        we share <gloss target="#t_AEC_1">AEC</gloss>’s assessment that it would
                        undercut prospects for private entry by removing the incentive for utilities
                        to sign contracts with <gloss target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss>, since the
                        government would be seen as committed to provide new capacity. Moreover,
                        even if initial private entry is achieved, it is unclear, given
                        technological, financial, and marketing uncertainties, whether the process
                        could be repeated with other firms using different technology (e.g.,
                        centrifuge) to provide the succession of new facilities needed to support
                        our foreign and domestic enrichment objectives over the coming decades. In
                        any event, whatever our domestic plans and programs, most foreign customers
                        would at this point be expected to doubt the long-term reliability of a
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> private entry policy.</p>
                    <p>2. The assumption that the enrichment business is conducive to private
                        ownership, at least in the near term, should be reviewed in light of recent
                        experience. The proposal to offer major assistance to facilitate <gloss
                            target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss>’s commitment raises the prospect of a
                        government-subsidized and federally supported industry with few of the
                        characteristics of competitive free enterprise. In any case, progress in
                        centrifuge technology suggests that there may not be room for private
                        competition in diffusion plants beyond the next increment. Yet the prospect
                        of early private commitments to large centrifuge plants is uncertain, since
                        the <gloss target="#t_AEC_1">AEC</gloss>’s centrifuge demonstration program
                        implies that substantial government assistance in the form of jointly funded
                        pilot-scale facilities will be necessary to ensure that commercial-scale
                        plants are built to meet future demand. Despite the fact that other elements
                        of the nuclear <pb n="367" facs="0401" xml:id="pg_367"/>fuel cycle in the
                        United States are in private hands, enrichment technology, financing, and
                        planning present unique problems. As in the case of nuclear waste disposal
                        (and as might well be the case in fuel reprocessing), the enrichment
                        function at this juncture might best be accomplished through a government
                        entity. Of course, under any form of government responsibility, private
                        industry would continue to play a major role in the enrichment field through
                        research and development activities, component manufacturing
                        responsibilities, and plant construction and facility operations under
                        government contracts.</p>
                    <p>3. The strongest argument favoring a policy of turning to the private sector
                        to provide enrichment services is that it would avoid the necessity of
                        making a substantial investment of government funds over the next
                        decade—which would not yield offsetting revenues until the 1990s. However,
                        it is possible to avoid this problem through the establishment of a
                        government corporation to assume responsibility for developing new capacity
                        and operating the three existing plants—while holding open a future
                        ownership role for the private sector in building additional elements of
                        capacity. Funding such a corporation would not necessarily involve
                        congressional appropriations or direct federal outlays; self-financing could
                        be accomplished by borrowing from the private money market or from the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Treasury which would issue bonds.
                        While the net expenditures of such a corporation would be included under the
                        federal debt ceiling, such expenditures would not contribute to the federal
                        budget deficit—as would be the case if <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1"
                            >ERDA</gloss> built new plants. Also, a government corporation would be
                        structured to permit the investment of foreign capital. Some foreign
                        countries would welcome the opportunity to invest in return for the
                        increased assurance they would gain regarding supplies of reactor fuel (and
                        of course for a share of the net revenues or bond interest).</p>
                    <p>4. In terms of responsiveness to foreign policy requirements, successful
                        private ownership may be acceptable, but either direct government ownership
                        or a properly-designed government corporation are clearly preferable. In the
                        energy field, government planning is necessary to integrate multilateral
                        initiatives abroad with capacity increases at home; our ability to initiate
                        multilateral enrichment programs has already been inhibited by our private
                        entry policy. While industry would be subject to government safeguard
                        agreements and national export controls, the formulation and implementation
                        of new non-proliferation policies could be complicated by the existence of
                        diverse <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> enrichment firms committed to
                        corporate goals. In addition, flexibility in offering enrichment services
                        under special terms to particular countries for diplomatic purposes or as
                        preferential treatment to <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> parties would
                        be diminished under private ownership. As a general point, although American
                        industry would be motivated to remain competitive <pb n="368" facs="0402"
                            xml:id="pg_368"/>on price and contract requirements in the world market,
                        it should be recognized that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is
                        competing internationally with enrichment organizations in which foreign
                        governments play major roles.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The Department of State recommends that an immediate
                            decision be made to establish a policy-responsive government corporation
                            to assume the responsibility for managing existing enrichment plants and
                            building new increments of capacity, holding open the prospect of
                            ultimately transferring to the private sector some or all of the
                            responsibility for constructing additional facilities.</hi> In terms of
                        the options presented in the <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 209
                        report, our recommendation would fall between alternative B, which
                        explicitly defers private entry until after the fourth and fifth plants are
                        built, and alternative C, which forms a government corporation to assume
                        complete and indefinite responsibility for enrichment.</p>
                    <p>In brief, our recommendation rests upon the following judgments:</p>
                    <p>—Short-term and long-term foreign policy interests would be extremely well
                        served through a government corporation which would not only permit a rapid
                        removal of the present “contracting gap,” but would also provide a policy
                        and management framework to assure the orderly introduction of new capacity,
                        scaled to meet foreign as well as domestic needs. Establishment of such a
                        corporation would permit the smooth integration of plants utilizing advanced
                        technologies presently being developed.</p>
                    <p>—A decision to move forward decisively in assuring future nuclear fuel supply
                        under a government corporation would strengthen efforts to utilize
                        alternative energy sources in the United States, and help support similar
                        efforts on the part of industrialized nations abroad. It would demonstrate
                        to <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> as well as to major consumers our
                        determination to respond to the current crisis.</p>
                    <p>—In contrast with direct <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss> ownership,
                        our recommended course of action would avoid contributing to federal budget
                        deficits. At the same time, a carefully designed corporation could remain
                        highly responsive to government policy and would be more responsive than
                        private ownership. Safeguards initiatives could be carefully managed,
                        foreign participation in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-based enriched
                        plants could be encouraged, and multilateral facilities located abroad could
                        be supported by such a corporation. Efficient operations and timely capacity
                        decisions, moreover, could help ensure that the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> would capture an appreciable fraction of the foreign
                        enrichment market, thus yielding financial as well as policy benefits.</p>
                    <p>—Under the recommended policy, private industry would remain active in
                        enrichment efforts through <gloss target="#t_RD_1">R&amp;D</gloss>,
                        manufacturing, and plant construction and operations. With this continued
                        experience, and as a <pb n="369" facs="0403" xml:id="pg_369"/>consequence of
                        technical assistance naturally provided by the corporation as a <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government instrument, private industry
                        could, at some future time, reach the position where it would be both
                        desirable and feasible for certain companies to finance, build, and own
                        specific increments of enrichment capacity (perhaps a series of small-scale
                        centrifuge plants) within an overall supply program and policy framework.
                        Whether this would result in private and corporation plants operating side
                        by side or ultimately involve transferring all new enrichment capacity to
                        the private sector need not be resolved at this stage.</p>
                    <p>The scenario associated with our recommendation would include the following
                        steps:</p>
                    <p>(1) An announcement by the President in February 1975 that, due to factors
                        largely beyond the control of the firms involved, the effort to achieve
                        private entry into the enrichment field has been unsuccessful, and that the
                        administration would shortly introduce legislation to establish a government
                        corporation to build and operate enrichment plants, until such time as
                        conditions warranted transfer of some or part of this responsibility to the
                        private sector.</p>
                    <p>(2) Subject to approval by the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, an immediate
                        resumption of contracting by <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss>
                        (preferably through an enrichment directorate), associated with a
                        Presidential decision to request initial plant construction funds in <gloss
                            target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss>’s <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 77
                        authorization.</p>
                    <p>(3) An urgent and comprehensive interagency study of the preferred structure
                        of a policy-responsive government corporation to be formed within a year to
                        assume responsibility for <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> enrichment
                        efforts, consistent with foreign and domestic objectives and recognizing the
                        goal of selective ownership opportunities for private industry in the
                        future.</p>
                    <p>(4) Informing <gloss target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss> of the President’s
                        decision as soon as possible, noting that, with its unique experience as the
                        only industrial entity to have studied the question of building a new
                        diffusion plant in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, Bechtel would
                        be in an excellent position to seek the contract to construct and operate a
                        new plant but could not be assured a preferred status.</p>
                    <p>(5) A plan to discuss the rationale and objectives of the President’s
                        decision at high levels with officials of electric utilities and nuclear
                        companies, as well as with prominent public figures and foreign
                        representatives, in an attempt to obtain constructive support at home and
                        abroad.</p>

                    <p>The 1974 Export Administration Act requires the President to report to

                    <p>Dear Joseph:</p>
                    <p>The purpose of this letter is to summarize for you and other Council members
                        the negotiations on an agreement governing nuclear explosions for peaceful
                        purposes (<gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>) in accordance with Article
                        III of the Threshold Test Ban Treaty (TTBT), and discussions pursuant to the
                            <pb n="374" facs="0408" xml:id="pg_374"/>
                        <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet joint statement of July 3, 1974,
                        on the subject of environmental warfare, both of which were recently begun
                        in Moscow.</p>
                    <p>Article III of the Threshold Test Ban Treaty provided that “underground
                        nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes shall be governed by an agreement
                        which is to be negotiated and concluded by the parties at the earliest
                        possible time.”</p>
                    <p>The first round of these negotiations took place in Moscow from October 7
                        until November 6, 1974.</p>
                    <p>The principal tasks of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> delegation
                        were to elicit Soviet views and proposals on the content of the <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> agreement and to obtain a better
                        understanding of the nature of the Soviet <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> program. During the negotiations the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> delegation stressed that any <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> agreement must satisfy the following
                        criteria:</p>
                    <p>(I) <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> must not provide weapon-related
                        benefits otherwise precluded or limited by the TTBT.</p>
                    <p>(II) The fact <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> activities are not
                        contributing to such benefits must be adequately verifiable.</p>
                    <p>(III) The agreement must be consistent with existing treaty obligations,
                        including in particular the Limited Test Ban Treaty (<gloss
                            target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>).</p>
                    <p>In addition to elaborating on these basic criteria, the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> delegation presented details of its <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> program, noting in particular that it is
                        very limited in scope; the Soviet program appears to be much broader. The
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> delegation stated that prospects
                        for the future involve only the possibility of a few experiments using
                        contained <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>. With respect to
                        verification, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> delegation took the
                        position that, for all <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>, information on
                        the yield, purpose, depth of burial, geographical coordinates and geology of
                        the explosion site, including basic physical properties of the rock, should
                        be provided with observers confirming as much of this information as
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>In the Moscow negotiations, the following principal features of the Soviet
                        position emerged:</p>
                    <p>(I) They asserted that there should be no limits on the yields or numbers of
                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>, claiming that this was consistent
                        with the obligations of <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> Article V. They
                        proposed that the time, location, yield and purpose of <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> greater than 150<gloss target="#t_KT_1"
                            >KT</gloss>. be provided prior to the event, with actual yield and
                        results provided afterward. For <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> with
                        yields greater than about 50–70 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>., but
                        below 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>., similar pre-shot data would
                        be provided, but added data would be provided only for cases where they
                        considered that the yield might be assessed as above the threshold. For
                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> below 50–70 <gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>., verification would rely on national
                        technical means.</p>
                    <p>(II) They proposed a “broad” agreement of cooperation with the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>,
                        in which the TTBT Article III verification provisions <pb n="375"
                            facs="0409" xml:id="pg_375"/>would be embedded. They stated that the
                        agreement might include a joint commission on cooperation in <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>, exchanges of information, instruments
                        and technical personnel, joint scientific <gloss target="#t_RD_1"
                            >R&amp;D</gloss> work in the institutes of both countries and joint
                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> projects in third countries in
                        accordance with Article V of the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>. They
                        are also attempting to tie the degree of cooperation involved in the
                        “narrow” task of verification under Article III of the TTBT to how “broad”
                        an agreement the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> will accept. Soviet
                        delegation Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MID_1">Morokhov</persName>
                        remarked that if the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> agreement is
                        narrowly confined to Article III considerations then only “minimum”
                        verification information would be provided.</p>
                    <p>(III) The Soviets agreed in principle at the July Summit that <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> observers could be present for at least
                        some <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>, but, as reported to the <gloss
                            target="#t_NAC_1">NAC</gloss> by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> on December 12, in the first round of these
                        negotiations their delegation backed away from this understanding. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MID_1">Morokhov</persName> stated that he could not tell us
                        whether or not the Soviets now favor arrangements for observers. The Soviet
                        delegation indicated that the verification information to be obtained by
                        observers would be routinely available to participants or “representatives”
                        in joint <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> projects. They did not,
                        however, rule out an Article III agreement dealing with verification matters
                        only.</p>
                    <p>(IV) The Soviets also discussed their current <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> program and listed several applications that might be
                        undertaken in the future.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> delegation noted that the Soviet
                        listing of <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> applications did not include
                        any contained <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> above 100 <gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>. and offered, on an ad referendum basis, to
                        accept a 100 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>. limit on contained <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> provided adequate verification, including
                        observers, were assured. The Soviet delegation did not accept this proposal.
                        They stated among other reasons that some contained applications might
                        eventually require much larger yields. The TTBT/PNE negotiations are now in
                        a working recess. They are expected to resume about February 10.</p>
                    <p>At the July 1974 <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>–<gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> Summit meeting, the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> agreed with the Soviets to advocate
                        effective measures to overcome the dangers of the use of environmental
                        modification techniques for military purposes. The two sides agreed to meet
                        bilaterally to explore the problem. Pursuant to the summit statement, <gloss

                        from November 1 through November 5. The objectives of the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> delegation were:</p>
                    <p>(I) To explore and assess the nature and scope of Soviet interest in measures
                        to overcome the dangers of the use of environmental modification techniques
                        for military purposes;</p>
                    <p>(II) To assess the prospect of eventually arriving at a common approach, and
                        to make clear to the Soviet side that such an approach <pb n="376"
                            facs="0410" xml:id="pg_376"/>cannot be expected on the basis of the
                        draft convention the Soviet Union introduced in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                            >UN</gloss> General Assembly.</p>
                    <p>During the meeting the Soviets repeatedly pressed the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> side to accept their draft or to table a draft on its own.
                        They emphasized that prohibited activities should be specified in detail and
                        include research and development. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        side made clear the unacceptability of the Soviet draft as a basis for the
                        discussions. The delegation stressed the need, as the first step, to agree
                        on a satisfactory conceptual approach to defining the subject matter of any
                        measures; and for differentiating measures concerned with this matter from
                        other arms control problems, the environmental effects of weapons, and other
                        “environmental” problems. It was made clear that in the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> view consideration of a convention,
                        including the degree of detail required, at this exploratory stage was
                        premature.</p>
                    <p>With regard to conceptual approach, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        side proposed that the subject matter under discussion be defined as
                        “efforts to release or manipulate, through the use of environmental
                        modification techniques, natural processes or forces for purposes of
                        destruction or disruption directed against an adversary.” In particular, the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> delegation suggested that the use
                        for military purposes of such techniques which could have widespread,
                        long-lasting or severe effects should fall within the purview of any
                        proposed ban.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> delegation also sought clarification
                        of the intended scope of the Soviet draft convention, which refers to
                        “military and other purposes incompatible with the maintenance of
                        international security, human well-being and health.” The Soviet side
                        indicated that this language was designed to cover all possible hostile uses
                        of environmental modification techniques, whether or not they were conducted
                        in a declared war. They made clear that incidental effects of civilian
                        applications would not be included.</p>
                    <p>In response to the Soviet proposal for a ban on research and development of
                        environmental modification techniques, the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> side stated that a broad prohibition of <gloss
                            target="#t_RD_1">R&amp;D</gloss> was not practical. The delegation
                        pointed out the intrinsically dual (civil or military) applicability of much
                        research on environmental modification and the likely impracticability of
                        verifying a broad prohibition on research and development for military
                        purposes.</p>
                    <p>In the course of the meeting, the sides also examined the state of scientific
                        and technical research in various areas of environmental modification.</p>
                    <p>From the point of view of both sides the exchange of opinions in Moscow was
                        useful for clarification and reaching agreement on posi<pb n="377"
                            facs="0411" xml:id="pg_377"/>tions in the future. It was agreed to hold
                        further consulations in Washington at a later date. These consulations

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Begin quote.</hi> The Secretary of State presents his
                        compliments to His Excellency the Ambassador of the Union of Soviet
                        Socialist Republics and has the honor to remind him of the continuing
                        importance attached by the Government of the United States to the full
                        compliance by the Government of the Soviet Union with the provisions of the
                        Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space, and
                        Under Water, signed at Moscow on August 5, 1963.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, the Government of the United States wishes to call to the
                        attention of the Government of the Soviet Union the collection by the
                        Government of the United States outside the borders of the Soviet Union of
                        radioactive debris directly associated with the Soviet nuclear explosions of
                        August 29 and November 2, 1974. The Government of the United States is
                        concerned by these occurrences, which are inconsistent with the terms of the
                        1963 Treaty of Moscow.</p>
                    <p>The United States Government has on several occasions since 1963 communicated
                        to the Government of the Soviet Union its views con<pb n="378" facs="0412"
                            xml:id="pg_378"/>cerning 17 previous nuclear explosions which have
                        similarly caused radioactive debris to be present in the atmosphere outside
                        the territory of the Soviet Union. As recently as May 22, 1974 the Soviet
                        Union replied to the latest United States communication on this subject, the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> aide-mémoire of March 21, 1974, and
                        stated that, “appropriate Soviet authorities were and are taking the
                        necessary measures for strict observance of Moscow Treaty of 1963 . . .”</p>
                    <p>As an original party to the 1963 Treaty of Moscow, the Government of the
                        United States expects the Government of the Soviet Union to take steps to
                        prevent any recurrence of such incidents. United States Government
                        experience in recent years has shown that with proper precautions it is
                        possible to prevent causing radio active debris to be present outside the
                        territory of a state conducting nuclear explosions.</p>
                    <p>The United States Government is of the view that full compliance with the
                        terms of the 1963 Treaty of Moscow by all parties is of vital importance,
                        both for preserving the integrity and effectiveness of this treaty and also
                        for the development between the Governments of the United States and of the
                        Soviet Union of that state of mutual confidence necessary to ensure the
                        success of future efforts to regulate nuclear explosions. The Government of
                        the United States assumes that the Government of the Soviet Union fully
                        shares this view. <hi rend="italic">End quote.</hi>

                    <p>On January 22, 1975, President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Gerald R.
                            Ford</persName> signed the instruments of ratification of the Geneva
                        Protocol of 1925 and the Biological Weapons Convention. At an afternoon
                        ceremony in the East Room of the White House, the President made the
                        following remarks:</p>
                    <p>“This is a very auspicious occasion. I am signing today the instruments of
                        ratification of two important treaties that limit arms and contribute to
                        lessening the horror of war.</p>
                    <p>“The first, the Geneva Protocol, prohibits the use in war of lethal and
                        incapacitating chemical and bacteriological weapons. Its ratification
                        completes the process, I should say, which began nearly 50 years ago in
                        1925, when the United States proposed and signed the protocol.</p>
                    <pb n="379" facs="0413" xml:id="pg_379"/>
                    <p>“The United States, I am glad to say, has always observed the principles and
                        objectives of the protocol. The ratification today marks our formal
                        commitment.</p>
                    <p>“Although it is our position that the protocol does not cover riot control
                        agents and chemical herbicides, I have decided that the United States shall
                        renounce their use in war as a matter of national policy, except in a
                        certain, very, very limited number of defense situations where lives can be
                        saved. This policy is detailed in the Executive Order that is being issued
                        today.</p>
                    <p>“The second treaty that I am signing is the Biological Weapons Convention,
                        which prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of
                        bacteriological weapons.</p>
                    <p>“It is the first international agreement since World War II to provide for
                        the actual elimination of an entire class of weapons—namely, biological
                        agents and toxicants.</p>
                    <p>“As evidence of our deep commitment to the objectives of this Biological
                        Weapons Convention, we have already destroyed our entire stockpile of
                        biological toxicant agents and weapons. Our biological warfare facilities
                        have been converted to peaceful uses.</p>
                    <p>“The final act in the process of ratifying this convention requires the
                        deposit of the Instruments of Ratification in Washington, London, and
                        Moscow, which will be done when the United Kingdom and the <gloss

                        procedures.</p>
                    <p>“Finally, I believe that these acts of ratification demonstrate the desire of
                        our nation to create and to contribute to a more peaceful world, and I
                        pledge to you that I will continue in the search for new measures to promote
                        that cause.</p>
                    <p>“I congratulate the Members of the Senate, the Members of the House, and the
                        American people for backing and supporting action of this kind. So, I will
                        sign both.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1"

                    </p>
                    <p>It was agreed that:</p>
                    <p>—the working group would prepare a paper showing the arguments for and
                        against producing binary chemical weapons on a best-case basis. The paper
                        would also include a deployment scheme and the costs of deployment and
                        production of binaries.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’m sorry I’m
                        late. Do we need—have a briefing?</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WVA_1">Walters</persName>: I have one if you
                        want. It’s short. (Began to brief from the attached.)</p>
                    <pb n="381" facs="0415" xml:id="pg_381"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Did you say the
                        Soviets have an antidote for nerve gas?</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WVA_1">Walters</persName>: Yes, they do.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: How do they use
                        it? What form is it in, pills?</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]: No, it’s injected by a

                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WVA_1">Walters</persName>: (Continued to
                        brief.)</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Who’s this
                        you’re talking about?</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WVA_1">Walters</persName>: Iraq. Iraq wants to
                        develop an offensive chemical weapons (<gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>)
                        capability. They have purchased and installed a nerve agent production plant
                        which may give them an agent capability by this Spring. They want it to use
                        against the Kurds. (Finished his briefing.)</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: As I understand
                        it, we have two issues before us. The first is what should <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy be regarding the production of
                        chemical weapons. The second is whether we should support some type of
                        international agreement on the limitation of chemical weapons at Geneva. In
                        respect to the first issue, we have three options as I understand it. The
                        first is whether we should acquire binary chemical weapons. The second is
                        whether we should rely instead on our existing <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss> offensive capability, and the third is, in effect, doing
                        away with our capability and relying instead on conventional and nuclear
                        forces. We don’t really have the first option because of congressional
                        opposition, isn’t that right?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: Well, I don’t know,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry</persName>. Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_SJC_2">Stennis</persName> has indicated to me that he would
                        help us if the President supports the acquisition of binary weapons.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Do you think
                        such a thing would ever get through Congress?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: I really don’t know,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry</persName>. I, personally am not in
                        favor of going to binaries. I’m just passing on what <persName
                            corresp="#p_SJC_2">Stennis</persName> told me.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: It would be a big
                        fight.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Can anybody make
                        a good case for producing binaries?</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PJ_1">Pauly</persName>: The Joint Chiefs would
                        prefer to produce binary weapons. We believe we are at the stage now where
                        our stockpiles need to be improved in quality. Binaries would do this for
                        us. They are safer, for one thing. Also, they would give us the ability to
                        deploy further forward.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Why would they
                        be easier to deploy further forward?</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PJ_1">Pauly</persName>: Well, for one thing,
                        they are safer. They are easier to handle and you can move them around
                        easier. Only two percent of our stockpile is now deployed overseas—in
                        Germany.</p>
                    <pb n="382" facs="0416" xml:id="pg_382"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Do we have any
                        in the Pacific?</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PJ_1">Pauly</persName>: Yes, six percent of our
                        stockpile is on Johnson Island.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: It’s a problem of
                        getting them from Colorado to Germany.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Isn’t the real question one
                        of how widely they are deployed in Germany? The problem is the quantity
                        there.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PJ_1">Pauly</persName>: That’s true.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Then, as I
                        understand it, our chemical weapons are currently deployed at only one base
                        in Germany, and I would presume the Soviets know where that base is, am I
                        right?</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PJ_1">Pauly</persName>: Yes. I think we can be
                        pretty sure they know where they are stored.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: And, if war
                        breaks out we can be fairly sure that one of the first things they will do
                        is knock out that base.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PJ_1">Pauly</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Are there any
                        plans—do we have any plans for <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> deployment
                        in the event of war?</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PJ_1">Pauly</persName>: I’m not sure, but there
                        would be a distribution problem. . . .</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Then it would
                        not be unreasonable to assume that the probability of the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> being able to retaliate in the event the
                        Soviets use <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> would be very slight.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PJ_1">Pauly</persName>: Yes, that’s right.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: So we end up
                        with a weapon we really can’t use because we can’t get it to where it needs
                        to be used. Could we see (get a paper on) what difficulties we would
                        encounter if we decide to go with the binaries? Could we see what kind of
                        deployments you would have to make? I think that what we have now does not
                        give the President a fair chance to make a decision. We ought to look at the
                        whole deployment thing—and make it on a best-case basis.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: I’m against producing
                        binaries.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, I want to
                        bring all of the alternatives to his (the President’s) attention, and I
                        think that we ought to make a better case for producing binaries. I don’t
                        think we have it here.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: Okay, we can do it.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I see that one
                        of our new options is to maintain our present <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss> stockpiles. Do you support that?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Why?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: So that we can retain
                        some appearance of being able to retaliate.</p>
                    <pb n="383" facs="0417" xml:id="pg_383"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What do we have,
                        two percent of our stockpile in Germany and six percent at Johnson Island,
                        and nowhere else? There is nothing that prevents us from moving it, is
                        there?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: No, you can move it to an
                        area of conflict, if you need to.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The point is, if
                        there is a conflict in say, Korea, can you move it there if you have to? I
                        would like to see a rational deployment plan for getting the stuff out of
                        Johnson Island. Where’s the rest of it?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: The rest—ninety percent
                        or so—is in Colorado and Utah.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: One of the problems is that
                        it costs an awful lot to get rid of. It’s cheaper to store than to
                        destroy.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’m not in favor
                        of getting rid of what we already have. What bothers me is that we don’t
                        have adequate studies that would show how we would get the stuff from
                        Colorado to the place where it might be needed. It seems to me that we are
                        in a <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> anti-<gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>
                        position. How does one go about using chemical weapons? Can you move it by
                        air?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Yes, air is probably the
                        best method.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What kind of
                        aircraft, drones?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DTD_1">Davies</persName>: No, you use airplanes for
                        safety reasons and because of the public image of moving them by other
                        means.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, but how do
                        you move it from Colorado and Utah to some foreseeable war zone? Do you use
                        C–150s?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: Yes, that would
                        probably be the aircraft you would use.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Can we take a
                        look at how we would move the stuff in the event it would be needed?</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PJ_1">Pauly</persName>: Yes, we can. One of the
                        imponderables, however, is how its movement would fit into other air
                        priorities at the time of conflict. My estimate would be that you could get
                        it to the area in four to five days.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Four to five
                        days? I think it would be a reasonable assumption that any enemy that would
                        use chemical warfare had crossed over the threshold, don’t you? I mean,
                        that’s pretty extreme. It was not used in Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WVA_1">Walters</persName>: We have a study here
                        that shows that 25 percent of your air capability . . .</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: The real question is what
                        is an adequate <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> capability.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I don’t see—I
                        have no strong views on this question, but what I am trying to do is
                        identify just what the President is going to have to decide. We have no real
                        retaliatory capability in <pb n="384" facs="0418" xml:id="pg_384"/>the
                        Pacific. We do have some retaliatory capability in Germany. But what if the
                        Soviets attack our stockpiles? The rest of it is in the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and how many days would it take to get
                        there? Ninety-two percent of our stockpiles are so positioned that unless
                        there is an immediate high point in a war we wouldn’t get it there in
                        time.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PJ_1">Pauly</persName>: That’s right. But, you
                        might have information that they are moving the stuff up. Then you would
                        make a conscious decision to deploy.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It’s hard to
                        imagine that you would have a build-up period. Suppose the Soviets double
                        their forces. Could you double your <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>
                        reserves in time? You wouldn’t move them until after you’re hit, would
                        you?</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PJ_1">Pauly</persName>: That’s right. But, if
                        you have information that they are moving their weapons up, you might want
                        to begin to move yours.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, all of you
                        are against binaries except the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Is that right?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Is there any law
                        against it being rationally deployed? It seems to me to make no sense to
                        keep ninety-two percent of the stuff where it can’t be used.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Domestic opposition to
                        moving it around would be very strong.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: Yes, but we’re not
                        going to deploy it domestically.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: But you still have to move
                        it within the country.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, could we
                        see what a rational deployment would look like? Where is all this stuff
                        kept?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: Our biggest stockpile
                        is in Denver, right at the end of the runway (Denver [Stapleton]
                        International Airport).</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Do they
                        (Denverites) know it’s there?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: Oh yes, and they are
                        worried about it. You know, that stuff is not easy to handle.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Okay. I’m just
                        trying to move this thing to the President for decision and I want to be
                        sure he has all the rationale for his decision.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: We are all agreed that
                        further deployment is politically impossible.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We now have the
                        ability to wage chemical warfare, but it is deployed in such a way that it
                        is not useable. I don’t understand that. How do you get it out of Johnson
                        Island? Do you see any area that would be able to get these weapons in four
                        to five days?</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PJ_1">Pauly</persName>: No, sir.</p>
                    <pb n="385" facs="0419" xml:id="pg_385"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Then it would
                        take four to five days before it would have any effect. What kind of weapon
                        is it? Does it make you sick?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It just seems to
                        me that our chemical weapons capability is irrelevant to the situation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName>: Not unless you have an
                        inadequate defensive capability.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: That’s true, and an
                        adequate defensive capability is a whole new story.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Can anybody make
                        a case against stockpiling an anti-<gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>
                        capability?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: No, but ours is very weak,
                        and Congress has to support it—with money.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PJ_1">Pauly</persName>: There is no real
                        opposition on the <persName corresp="#p_HRC_1">Hill</persName> to storing a
                        defensive capability. But, the problem is time. It would take until the
                        early 1980s before we could build up an adequate defensive capability.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, do we have
                        a working group?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_EDD_1">Elliott</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Can the working
                        group do a paper . . . I don’t think we need a separate <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> on this. We’ll just tack it on the end of
                        one in the near future. We need a paper that defines the issues so the
                        President can make his decision. Am I correct that nobody here favors the
                        destruction of our current stocks and that nobody but the Joint Chiefs of
                        Staff favor production of binaries? Do it (the paper) on a best-case basis,
                        and also include arguments against producing binaries.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: Do you want the costs
                        included as well?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, include the
                        costs.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Is it fair to say that we
                        would reduce our stockpiles if it doesn’t cost too much?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What are our
                        agents? What do we use?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: Nerve gas.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Why nerve gas?
                        How do we store it?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: In tanks. It’s cheaper to
                        store it that way.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PJ_1">Pauly</persName>: You have a two-pronged
                        problem with storing the stuff: one, it loses its potency after a certain
                        period of time, and two, it becomes contaminated from the tanks—a chemical
                        reaction.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, that leads
                        to the next set of issues—what do we want to propose at Geneva? As I
                        understand it, the Joint Chiefs’ position is that they want to maintain
                        current stockpiles at our present level as a retaliatory deterrent. Another
                        option is a ban on all current production.</p>
                    <pb n="386" facs="0420" xml:id="pg_386"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: A production ban on agents
                        only.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The third option
                        is to prohibit both stockpiles and production. My problem is that all of
                        these alternatives are totally unverifiable. If we go for an agreement, it’s
                        unverifiable. We can’t get a handle on their production, can we?</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WVA_1">Walters</persName>: [<hi rend="italic">1

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: That would be one advantage
                        of an agreement—you may stop them from producing it.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: For whom? The
                        Eastern European countries?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: No, Iran and Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s the whole
                        issue here. We can get an agreement, but we can’t verify it. What good does
                        that do? Iran and Egypt could have it and we wouldn’t even know. I don’t
                        even know where to look for it, do you?</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WVA_1">Walters</persName>: I believe we could
                        find it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: One thing you could do is
                        soften an agreement—make it a ten year deal with the stipulation that the
                        whole issue could be reopened.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, the
                        President just can’t make a decision based on what we have here. All these
                        options are unverifiable. How would you handle the refilling problem if we
                        chose Option II?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: That’s the problem,
                        we’d have to build a new plant.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Would you refill
                        the old equipment or the new?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: The old stuff.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What, with a new
                        batch of the old stuff, or a new batch of the new stuff?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: No, the old stuff.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Are we going to
                        run out of it?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Not for a long time. We
                        have quite a bit now.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_EDD_1">Elliott</persName>: OST has just completed a
                        study which shows that the gas stored in bulk has an indefinite lifetime,
                        but that it tends to deteriorate in the filled.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I might as well
                        get an education here. What is bulk? Does that mean tanks? Where is it
                        stored? What is filled?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_EDD_1">Elliott</persName>: Bulk means tanks. That’s
                        where it is stored—in tanks. Filled means in weapons, like artillery
                        shells.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: The problem is that the
                        casings of artillery shells deteriorate over a period of time.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PJ_1">Pauly</persName>: We’re finding that some
                        of our weapons, particularly the filled variety, lose their purity over a
                        period of time.</p>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What does it do

                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PJ_1">Pauly</persName>: I’m not sure. It has
                        something to do with aging.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Would I offend
                        anybody too much if I said that the level of analysis in this group is not
                        on the level of the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> people? Well,

                    <p>We ought to work out a scheme for holding or moving these various issues. A

                        without going into specifics, in return for which we expect agreement, in

                    <p>4. On the Threshold Test Ban, the real issue comes down to our toleration for

                    <p>You may decide to raise Option III, as follows:</p>
                    <p>—It is our impression that if we included air and nuclear forces in our

                        army.</p>
                    <p>—In the interest of moving the talks forward, we are considering certain
                        proposals on air and nuclear elements. In particular, we are considering an
                        offer to withdraw a significant number of nuclear weapons from the <gloss

                        ground forces).</p>
                    <p>—In return, we would have to have Soviet withdrawal of a tank army consisting
                        of 68,000 men and 1,700 tanks in Phase I and agreement on the concept of a
                        common manpower ceiling within the area as the goal for reductions in Phase
                        II.</p>
                    <p>—However, we would be interested in obtaining the reaction of the Soviet side
                        in these channels as soon as possible.</p>

                    <p>Our first series of talks in Moscow November 1–5 only pointed up the
                        differences between the Soviet catch-all approach, as set out in their draft
                        convention tabled earlier at the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss>, and
                        our strictly limited “Option II” position, which would not include limits on

                        that time. Our immediate objective is simply to maintain the dialogue and
                        forestall tabling of a Soviet draft in Geneva by extending the bilaterals
                        into the period when the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> is in session.
                        If you offer an agreement by the summit, the Soviets might see it in their
                        interest to subscribe to our more limited approach (especially since it is
                        not a serious issue).</p>

                        citing our agreement in the July 3, 1974, summit communiqué to consider a

                        you asked for more work on the question of whether we should produce binary

                        the Soviets wish—we are to have an agreement by the summit.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Yield Limit of Contained Explosions.</hi> We are proposing
                        a 100-kiloton limit and on-site observers. However, we have some flexibility
                        to move the yield up or to drop the observers.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Verification of Excavation Shots.</hi> Here we have
                        proposed a yield limit of 150 kilotons (with a salvo limit of 500 <gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">kts</gloss>), observers and a very low limit on the
                        fission yield of the device (say one-half kiloton). Eventually our
                        verification needs could be satisfied either by the overall yield limit or,
                        if the Soviets want explosions over 150 kilotons, by limiting the fission
                        yield of each shot. This is going to be difficult for the Soviets either
                        way, however, because a 150-kiloton threshold may constrain to some extent
                        the Pechora-Kama project while the fission yield limit will require fairly
                        intrusive on-site observer activity.</p>

                        will probably want explicit or tacit help from us in getting around this

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: (To Gen.
                            <persName corresp="#p_WVA_1">Walters</persName>) Do you have an opening
                        prayer?</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WVA_1">Walters</persName>: I don’t have an
                        official briefing, but I am prepared to give you some remarks about the
                        current Soviet <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> (peaceful nuclear
                        explosions) effort and about the status of the nuclear programs of some
                        other countries.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Okay, I’ll give
                        you five minutes.</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WVA_1">Walters</persName>: (Began to brief from
                        the attached).</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: How can
                        Argentina be [in]dependent of foreign suppliers?</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WVA_1">Walters</persName>: By having their own
                        chemical and technical capability.</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]: They already have their own
                        uranium supply. We believe they will have their own nuclear weapons
                        capability by the early 1980s.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: They have their
                        own uranium?</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WVA_1">Walters</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: How about that.
                        Well, that won’t be my problem. I won’t be around in the early 1980s.</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WVA_1">Walters</persName>: (Finishing his
                        briefing) End of prayer.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We have two
                        problems to discuss this morning, and I think we can dispense with both of
                        them quickly. The first is peaceful nuclear explosions, and the second is on
                        procedural aspects of nonproliferation. In respect to <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>, the problem, as I understand it, is one
                        of yield limits and verification requirements, and <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1"
                            >LTBT</gloss> (Limited Test Ban Treaty) aspects of excavation <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>. As I understand it, there is a general
                        consensus within this group on what the yield limits should be and on
                        verification provisions for contained <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>.
                        There is also interagency agreement that contained <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNEs</gloss> should have a 100<gloss target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss> limit
                        and that observers should be included to verify such things as geophysical
                        characteristics and data exchange. There is also agreement, as I understand
                        it, that we would agree to fall off from our insistence on observers if the
                        Soviets agree to 100<gloss target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss> contained <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>. If the Soviets <pb n="393" facs="0427"
                            xml:id="pg_393"/>insist on 150<gloss target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss>
                        contained <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>, then we will insist on
                        observers. Also, as I understand it, if we place a limit of 100<gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss> on explosions, this would be consistent with
                        the TTBT. But, if they up the limit to 150<gloss target="#t_KT_1"
                        >kt</gloss>, then we would have to insist on observers. So, we are agreed on
                        starting out with a 100<gloss target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss> limit and
                        observers, but are prepared to fall off from that if necessary. Is that
                        essentially correct?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Okay. The next
                        problem is excavation <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>. As I understand
                        our position, we want a limit of 150<gloss target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss> yield
                        on individual excavation <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> plus a
                            500<gloss target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss> limit on salvo (aggregate group)
                        yields. There would also be a requirement for observers. The observers would
                        verify such things as depth of burial, detailed geological characteristics,
                        and fission yields.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: I don’t quite agree with
                        you on that. I think there is another way to handle the excavation <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>. I don’t think we need to get involved
                        with observers as long as excavation <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>
                        are the same yield as contained PNEs.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: <persName
                            corresp="#p_IFC_1">Fred</persName>, you’re fighting the problem. The
                        President (<persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>) already agreed in
                        Moscow to go beyond a 150<gloss target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss> limit on
                        excavation <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>. Yield limits below
                            150<gloss target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss> are another problem.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: I thought that we had
                        agreed to explore the possibilities. We also have the <gloss
                            target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> problem on excavation <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Nobody
                        understands the Moscow agreement (<gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>).
                        We can reopen the question, but only with the clear provision that there is
                        adequate inspection. But we can’t go to the Soviets with another proposal
                        above 150<gloss target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss>. We can’t go back to the
                        Russians and say we want to scrub the 150<gloss target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss>
                        limit.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: I think we can separate out
                        the 150 aggregate kiloton issue without getting into trouble. I think we can
                        make a provision for aggregate yields up to the 150<gloss target="#t_KT_1"
                            >kt</gloss> limit. Observers would not be needed as they are much
                        cleaner yields. For observers to pick up melt samples for determining
                        fission yields is a cumbersome operation anyway.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, let me
                        make this very clear. I do not want the agencies going around reopening
                        issues that the President has already decided upon. If it’s possible to
                        bundle up the 150<gloss target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss> package with a 500<gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss> group limit, that’s okay. But, we can’t go
                        in with that position.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRW_1">Buchheim</persName>: I thought last June we
                        had made the decision on aggregate limits.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That was your
                        decision, but not the President’s.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: We have the problem of how
                        good the melt samples are.</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_GE_1">Giller</persName>: At the present time we
                        feel that we do have the ability to collect melt samples. We’re confident
                        that a low fission yield limit <pb n="394" facs="0428" xml:id="pg_394"/>will
                        constrain the Soviets from developing weapons under the guise of <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> at least for the near term, the next ten
                        years or so. The problem is whether we will be able to ten to fifteen years
                        from now. We differ from <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Fred</persName> (Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>) in this regard.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It seems to me
                        that it is not possible to begin negotiations with the Soviets when they
                        have already agreed on observers for explosions above 150<gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss>. It’s just the wrong way to begin
                        negotiations. We start at the beginning asking for observers and then come
                        back later offering to drop observers as a compromise. I agree that we ought
                        to explore the cluster method. That may be a way to get at it. But, falling
                        off from the observer requirement at the beginning is the wrong way to go
                        about it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Observers can do the
                        verifying on the aggregate yields and wouldn’t have to concern themselves
                        with the fission yields, which are hard to sample anyway.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: So, what you are
                        saying is that the only way to get an agreement above the 150<gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss> limit is in clusters. <persName
                            corresp="#p_IFC_1">Fred</persName>, what is really the issue?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: We should first propose
                        limiting all <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> to the 150<gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss> level, then we can fall back to a cluster
                        limit, say at 500<gloss target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The point is—the
                        question is whether we can get a break in the deadlock. You say the only way
                        to do this is to cluster them at about 150<gloss target="#t_KT_1"
                        >kt</gloss>. We should say instead that <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNEs</gloss> above 150<gloss target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss> would be
                        permitted if adequate inspection procedures could be found. If adequate
                        procedures are not found, then we can retreat to the clusters. But, to fall
                        off a position the President has already okayed is not right. Then the
                        Soviets will say that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is lying. Our
                        word will be worthless. The Soviets will adopt the attitude that we don’t
                        mean what we say. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>
                        agreed to negotiate an agreement permitting yields of over 150<gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss> if they were monitored. We have to put
                        forward what we have already agreed to and then go to the next position.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: But we can ask them (the
                        Soviets) how this monitoring is to be done.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Suppose they
                        tell us how it is done. What then?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: We can say that what they
                        propose is not sufficient—that we know of a more satisfactory way. We won’t
                        reject their proposal outright.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sonnenfeldt: They’ve already told us how the monitoring is to be
                        done.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I have no
                        trouble with the outline. The working group paper is a good analysis. I have
                        the problem that our efforts for an agreement can use a lot of fat with the
                        Russians. We have said that <pb n="395" facs="0429" xml:id="pg_395"/>we
                        would agree to something and then come back seven months later and say we
                        don’t. That doesn’t make sense.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sonnenfeldt: The agreed strategy is to give some more details to the
                        Soviets, including observer requirements.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: This is a more
                        sensible program. I think we should give them all that we need on observer
                        requirements. Let’s be tough on that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Then we get into a debate
                        on the modalities.</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_GE_1">Giller</persName>: Details are not
                        important.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Let’s tell it to
                        them. We can tell them what is needed, and then they can say it is
                        impossible. Then, we can say what do you think needs to be done, and then
                        say this proposal is much more acceptable. They can go to the Politburo with
                        something like that. I think it is much better to negotiate from such a
                        position than to go to them asking what they want.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: There is a further
                        problem—violation of the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: <persName
                            corresp="#p_IFC_1">Fred</persName>, that’s a totally different thing. If
                        we say no to going over a 150<gloss target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss> limit that’s
                        going back on our word. We have no obligation to change the <gloss
                            target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: We have to recognize that
                        excavation <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> and the <gloss
                            target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> are related and the negotiations could
                        fail over this.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If it fails it’s
                        because of the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>. We can manage that.
                        That’s another thing. If they can figure out how to do excavations without
                        violating the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> that’s okay, but
                        there’s no technical way to do it is there? If we want to make it fail, we
                        can stick on the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>. I am not
                        recommending to this group that we change. I do not feel that we have the
                        slightest reason to change our position on the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1"
                            >LTBT</gloss>. That is their (the Soviets’) problem. We want to resist
                        pressure to change the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> for
                        excavations.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: For the Soviets it’s a
                        tactical question of how excavations are handled under the <gloss
                            target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: <persName
                            corresp="#p_IFC_1">Fred</persName>, I feel we have a moral obligation to
                        put forward our position on a 500<gloss target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss> limit on
                        excavation <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>. Let it fail, what the hell
                        do we care? Maybe they will accept restrictions on a 500<gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss> limit and it will still fail. I just don’t
                        want to be cute with them. The <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> should
                        not be modified. I don’t want to give the Russians the impression that we
                        are trying to screw them on something. The President has agreed to going
                        above 150<gloss target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss> already. If we can do both,
                        well, fine. But, we can’t go back on something the President has already
                        agreed to.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SRC_1">Seamans</persName>: We (<gloss
                            target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss>) are with you on that.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Then what the
                        Hell are you doing at this meeting? Don’t you know this is where everybody
                        is against me?</p>
                    <pb n="396" facs="0430" xml:id="pg_396"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SRC_1">Seamans</persName>: I guess I haven’t been
                        in town long enough.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You’ll learn. I
                        just don’t want us to be cute about this thing. I don’t want the Soviet
                        delegation going back to the Politburo with the report that the Americans
                        are doublecrossing them. I think we should be tough, I think we should be
                        mean, and I think we should be complicated. What we want is a 150<gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss> yield limit on single explosions and a
                            500<gloss target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss> limit on aggregates (salvos).</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: That’s fine as long as our
                        distinction on fission yield samples does not become misconstrued as
                        implying agreement that excavation <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> are
                        okay under the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: <persName
                            corresp="#p_IFC_1">Fred</persName>, that’s a totally separate issue. I
                        agree with you that observers should not use samples to get around the
                        Limited Test Ban Treaty. Test samples are for determining whether there has
                        been a weapons test. The <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> has to do
                        with venting and can be handled separately. Our position should be that if
                        there is radioactive material floating around in the atmosphere, then it is
                        not acceptable.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sonnenfeldt: That may get us into a negotiation on the <gloss
                            target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: They will
                        continue to use their definition. Will they have trouble at 500<gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss>?</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_GE_1">Giller</persName>: I think they will have
                        trouble at 150<gloss target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss>, let alone a ceiling of
                            500<gloss target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We will maintain
                        our position on the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>. We have to
                        recognize that there is a grey area between what is gas and what is debris,
                        but that is nothing new.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM_1">Lodal</persName>: We have faced that problem
                        before; in the case of weapons test ventings, which we’ve protested.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: In either event
                        we still have the problem, with or without the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> agreement.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_EDD_1">Elliott</persName>: We would still face the
                        problem of having to modify the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>. We
                        could be neutral if they . . .</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We will permit
                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> if there are consistent with the
                            <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>. We will oppose the Soviets if
                        they want to revise the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: I doubt the Russians
                        would want to revise the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> at this
                        point. The real issue with the Russians at this point is whether we are
                        going to cooperate on <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s the real

                        you think?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: I don’t really know if
                        we can answer that question at this point. We would have no problem with
                        cooperation if we settle the verification aspects satisfactorily.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: We could use existing

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Can’t we keep
                        environmental criticism out of print?</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_GE_1">Giller</persName>: No. If you have a treaty
                        that simply permits <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> you can, but not
                        if you join in cooperation in <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>. And, it
                        gets us in for a cooperative venture that is not consistent with the
                        environmental aspects.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: So environmental
                        objections will be raised. Domestically, international cooperation will be
                        used to pry loose data. Then, I assume we are not prepared to cooperate.</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_GE_1">Giller</persName>: If we sign an agreement
                        to cooperate we will have to go through the environmental procedures.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What we say and
                        what we do has to be kept out of public discussion.</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_GE_1">Giller</persName>: I think an agreement on
                        cooperation on <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> is good, but we should
                        not sign it as part of the Threshold Test Ban Treaty.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: We need not have a separate
                        agreement. Also, we should look at other negative aspects.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: <persName
                            corresp="#p_IFC_1">Fred</persName>, what do you really have in mind?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Well, for one thing, it
                        would be very unpopular. In the second place, it would get us into a bind on
                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> with other countries; Germany and
                        Israel, for example.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Whether we
                        cooperate or not is a technical point. Either we tell them we oppose
                        cooperation on <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> or say we are prepared
                        to cooperate. But, I don’t believe we should be getting into a treaty. Maybe
                        it should be on an ad hoc basis, project by project.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: They know we don’t have the
                        necessary support for this.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We can tell them
                        that we are prepared to cooperate with them, but outside of a formal
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: I just don’t think we
                        should get into cooperation <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        agreements.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: <persName
                            corresp="#p_IFC_1">Fred</persName>, you are confusing the two issues—the
                        legal framework with whether or not cooperation should take place.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: We’ve already talked to the
                        Soviets about this and there is no clear understanding about this.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It is one thing
                        to say that we won’t cooperate on <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>. But
                        if the Soviets are determined to have a <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        agreement, I don’t understand why we shouldn’t go along with them.</p>
                    <pb n="398" facs="0432" xml:id="pg_398"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: It’s a question of Article
                        V (of the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>) obliging us to share <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> benefits with non-nuclears. We don’t want
                        to push <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> benefits, for non-proliferation
                        reasons.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The question is
                        whether a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet Agreement to cooperate
                        has anything to do with non-proliferation.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: The trouble is that our
                        national policies are affected by what Congress thinks and about what is
                        going on out in Colorado.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, we ought
                        to know what we want to do. We have to have a national policy before we try
                        to reach some sort of agreement with the Soviets. I think it’s better to
                        have a cooperation agreement. I think we ought to defer the issue. (To
                            <persName corresp="#p_SBA_1">Scowcroft</persName>) Let’s have a study of
                        this right away. We’re just not ready for that decision.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sonnenfeldt: The Soviets, however, will keep after us for some sort of
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: How would going on with a
                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> cooperation agreement benefit
                        us?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What would be
                        the losses? Who would be affected by an agreement?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: My impression is that
                        Germany might want <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>. They’ve done some
                        work with the Egyptians.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The Germans
                        won’t have <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> based on national policy.
                        We would tell them it’s not in their interest. We can’t say to the other
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> countries that we’ll help on <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> but if you ask us we can’t do it.
                        Non-weapons states have no capability for nuclear explosions. What would you
                        do if they want PNEs?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: If Brazil, for example,
                        asks for a 70<gloss target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss> device that wouldn’t be
                        interfering with the Threshold Treaty. It could be done.</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WVA_1">Walters</persName>: If we refused them they
                        would do it on their own.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Okay, we need a
                        national policy on peaceful nuclear explosions. We won’t get all the issues
                        unless we have a national policy. (To General <persName corresp="#p_SBA_1"
                            >Scowcroft</persName>) We need the study right away. It has been my
                        experience that a country’s interest in a nuclear capability is for weapons
                        purposes anyway. As long as they have the right to do <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>, they can still come up with an
                        explosion. There is only one excuse for a nuclear explosion, and that is for
                        weapons development. The Indians understand it.</p>
                    <p>Now, on nonproliferation. We have agreed to continue on with the Nuclear
                        Suppliers Conference. As I understand, the preparations for the conference
                        have stopped until we get a reply from the French. If we don’t get an answer
                        by March 10, we’ll start bilateral talks. I think we should have a detailed
                        plan and put it forward to this group.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM_1">Lodal</persName>: The working group is
                        already working on this.</p>
                    <pb n="399" facs="0433" xml:id="pg_399"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I will talk to
                            <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Sauvagnargues</persName> (French Foreign
                        Minister) about it after my trip to the Middle East. I think, however, that
                        we will have to move toward a suppliers conference by March 10.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: And hope in the meantime
                        that they don’t settle their deal with Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, that is a
                        good point. We should make the point with them, saying that we hope they
                        won’t do anything inconsistent with our approach to the conference.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: You may have to make the
                        same point with the Germans. They are about to conclude a deal with the
                        Brazilians.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, we should
                        do that.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The President has decided that the following will be the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> position for the next phase of the
                        negotiations on underground nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes (<gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>), beginning in Moscow on February 10,
                        1975:</p>
                    <p>1. The basic purpose of the negotiations is to develop a <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> agreement as called for in Article III of
                        the Threshold Test Ban Treaty (TTBT).</p>
                    <p>2. To insure that contained <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> do not
                        provide weapons-related benefits otherwise precluded or limited by the TTBT,
                        such <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> events <pb n="400" facs="0434"
                            xml:id="pg_400"/>could be no higher than 100 <gloss target="#t_KT_1"
                            >KT</gloss>. There would be provision for observers, whose rights would
                        include verifying geology, depth-of-burial, and purpose.</p>
                    <p>3. The President has decided that, in an otherwise acceptable agreement
                        providing for contained <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> to be limited
                        to 100 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> would forego observers of contained <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>. Alternatively, if adequate provision is
                        made for observers, contained <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> could be
                        permitted up to a yield of 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>. However,
                        the Delegation should not propose either of these positions to the Soviets
                        unless authorized by Washington.</p>
                    <p>4. The <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> agreement must be consistent with
                        existing treaty obligations, including the Limited Test Ban Treaty (<gloss

                            >LTBT</gloss> or to discuss possible radioactivity criteria under the

                    <p>5. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Delegation should present the
                        following proposal for excavation <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>.
                        These provisions are intended to insure that such <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNEs</gloss> do not provide weapons-related benefits otherwise
                        precluded or limited by the TTBT:</p>
                    <p>a. Each excavation <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> device must have a
                        total fission yield below an agreed maximum, but no greater than 0.5 <gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>b. To preclude atmospheric effects testing, each device must be emplaced at a
                        depth not less than 30 W <hi rend="superscript">1\3</hi> meters, where W is
                        the yield in <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>c. Observers should have rights which include verifying geology and
                        depth-of-burial, taking radiochemistry samples to measure the fission yield,
                        deploying temporary instruments to detect simultaneous and nearby contained
                        explosions, and access to relevant areas as needed.</p>
                    <p>d. There should be agreed limits on the yields of excavation <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>. In particular, the yield of any one
                        salvo could not exceed 500 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> and a limit on
                        the maximum individual yield of each excavation device would be agreed.</p>
                    <p>6. The President has decided that, provided there was adequate provision for
                        observers, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> could in principle
                        accept alternative formulations of the yield and verification requirements
                        set forth in paragraph 5. However, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        Delegation should not propose to the Soviets any such alternative
                        formulations unless authorized by Washington.</p>
                    <p>7. Timely information should be provided about each <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> event. This information should include purpose, location,
                        schedule, depths-of-burial, geophysical properties, expected results, and
                        actual results.</p>
                    <p>8. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has no objection in principle to
                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> cooperation. However, verification
                        requirements for a <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> agreement pursuant
                        to Article <pb n="401" facs="0435" xml:id="pg_401"/>III of the TTBT must be

                    <p>9. The Delegation should refrain from discussing the relationship of <gloss

                        objectives.</p>

                        Negotiations During Week of February 10, 1975.</p>
                    <p>1. Plenaries were held February 10th, 12th and 14th, with restricted session
                        with <persName corresp="#p_MID_1">Morokhov</persName>, Timerbaev and
                        Safronov February 12th.</p>
                    <p>2. At opening session, <persName corresp="#p_MID_1">Morokhov</persName>
                        expressed an optimistic attitude but his statement contained little
                        substance. He praised the Vienna <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>
                        technical panel and <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet technical
                        bilaterals, expressing much interest in “<gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss>-Thai Kra canal project.” <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1"
                            >Stoessel</persName> restated <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        criteria for any <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> agreement and stated
                        that <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> side had conducted extensive
                        review of issues during the recess and was prepared to present <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> views on appropriate limitations and
                        verification provisions for both contained and excavation <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>3. At second plenary, <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> side presented
                        proposal to limit yield of contained <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>
                        to 100 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> and provide for exchange of
                        information, and acquisition of data by observers as part of verification.
                        Soviet side presented no statement.</p>
                    <p>4. Purpose of restricted session on February 12 was to explain to Soviet side
                        that we had accommodated their desire not to discuss subject of observers in
                        plenaries during Round I, but that we must now deal with this matter and we
                        wished to discuss procedures with them. <persName corresp="#p_MID_1"
                            >Morokhov</persName> agreed that <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        side should present its views in plenaries or restricted sessions as we
                        wished but that the matter of observers <pb n="402" facs="0436"
                            xml:id="pg_402"/>is linked to cooperation and that Soviet side had not
                        yet received a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> response to their
                        proposal for a cooperation agreement.</p>
                    <p>5. At third plenary held morning February 14, <persName corresp="#p_MID_1"
                            >Morokhov</persName> offered brief preliminary views of <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> February 12 presentation, expressing
                        preference for dividing <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> into
                        categories of “under development” and “mastered,” rather than “contained”
                        and “excavation.” In absence of <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1"
                            >Stoessel</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BRW_1">Buchheim</persName>
                        presented illustrative outline of observer functions for contained <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_MID_1"
                            >Morokhov</persName> said that this subject had no interest for the
                        Soviet side but then he and other members of Soviet delegation asked a
                        number of questions. He also stated that the described observer functions
                        went beyond verification and would result in the acquisition of information
                        of technical and commercial value on <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        technology. Safronov asked several questions about the volume of information
                        required and logic behind these requirements. Myasnikov asked about
                        providing geological samples from exploratory drill holes rather than the
                        emplacement hole, and about the radius of observer activities. The <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> side made no substantive reply but
                        indicated we would further explain our contained position in next plenary,
                        scheduled for 11:00 a.m. February 17. Soviet side made it clear they
                        intended to hear all portions of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        position before providing substantive comments.</p>

                        with <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName>, <persName

                        included: (1) he asked what we now thought about <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> cooperation, (2) he stated that excavation <gloss

                        and that they must comply with <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>, (3)
                        he speculated about the possibility of a set or sequence of partial
                        agreements.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>Pursuant to our recent discussion, I am submitting this memorandum outlining
                        certain high priority actions which, as I see them, should be pursued
                        urgently to curb the further spread of nuclear weapons. I recommend that we
                        give somewhat higher priority in our arms control and defense policies to
                        the objective of curbing the proliferation of nuclear weapons; specifically,
                        that we take certain steps in addition to our present effort to coordinate
                        export controls among the key suppliers of nuclear technology.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion</p>
                    <p>1. Our current intelligence assessment is that South Korea is attempting to
                        develop nuclear weapons and can have an initial capability in ten years.
                        Taiwan will probably have such a capability in five years. Argentina could
                        have nuclear explosives in ten years. The Argentine program would in turn
                        prompt the Brazilians to follow close behind. The Union of South Africa is
                        moving towards a capability to build nuclear weapons. Pakistan has been
                        making efforts to acquire the means to manufacture plutonium. And
                        Iran—although a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty—is coming into
                        possession of the nuclear materials and know-how as a result of its large
                        purchase of reactors. Iraq would probably follow Iran’s example. There are
                        indications Libya is strongly interested in acquiring nuclear weapons and
                        indigenous technical know-how or becoming, through financial assistance, a
                        partner with such countries as Pakistan. These developments, in turn, could
                        impel some of the industrialized <hi rend="italic">potential</hi> nuclear
                        states to move into a weapons program.</p>
                    <pb n="404" facs="0438" xml:id="pg_404"/>
                    <p>If these trends cannot be checked, serious new threats to our security are
                        likely to arise in the 1980s—threats for which our military forces would be
                        ill-prepared. Also, should we fail to take more vigorous action now, we
                        would appear to be co-responsible for further proliferation because of our
                        close association with several countries now on the verge of going
                        nuclear.</p>
                    <p>2. Our effort to organize a supplier’s conference for tightening export
                        controls on nuclear materials and technology represents the most serious and
                        realistic effort any government has yet made to slow proliferation. However,
                        its success may depend to a large extent on the French attitude. And even if
                        we manage to achieve our objectives for the conference on export controls,
                        the situation would be improved but far from resolved. Without political
                        backup, the export controls will be inadequate in the end. A determined
                        government could circumvent these controls, especially the fragile
                        safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>
                    <p>3. The Non-Proliferation Treaty is important because some states, such as the
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> and Japan, are restrained by
                        essentially political considerations. The number of countries that cannot be
                        restrained by export controls will grow because nuclear technology is
                        inevitably becoming more accessible throughout the world. For them and some
                        others, the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> could be a useful barrier
                        against domestic pressures to develop a nuclear weapons capacity. In
                        addition, the Treaty helps maintain in many regions a network of commitments
                        among neighboring countries not to start a nuclear competition against each
                        other, and thus avoid precisely the kind of nuclear competition now
                        threatening between India and Pakistan or between Argentina and Brazil.</p>
                    <p>Today, however, the Non-Proliferation Treaty is at an impasse because Japan
                        and Italy might indefinitely delay their ratification. This could lead to an
                        unravelling of the Treaty. Without Italy’s ratification the Federal Republic
                        of Germany (and perhaps other Euratom countries) would probably not become
                        parties. Other signatories would then fail to ratify, or perhaps even
                        withdraw and embark on a nuclear weapons program.</p>
                    <p>To be sure, parties to the Treaty could withdraw from it in any event or
                        violate it, much as they could circumvent our export controls. Indeed,
                        Taiwan may now be in the process of doing both. Nor will the Treaty cover
                        all the countries of concern to us.</p>
                    <p>4. In addition to export controls and the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                            >NPT</gloss>, a third critical question is what action we take with
                        certain specific countries where we have influence and that are now actively
                        pursuing nuclear weapons. Export controls and the Non-Proliferation Treaty
                        are only as strong as the political resolve that backs them up. If some of
                        the smaller countries are seen to be pursuing nuclear weapons
                        unchecked—particularly <pb n="405" facs="0439" xml:id="pg_405"/>countries
                        over whom our influence is presumed to be strong—larger countries may
                        question their own decisions to renounce these powerful weapons, and perhaps
                        even their decisions to impose controls on commercial exports of nuclear
                        technology.</p>
                    <p>A first test case here is what we do about South Korea’s nuclear program, a
                        program which will have adverse effects on stability in East Asia and on
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> interests in that area, including
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> security commitment to South Korea.
                        Our influence on that country, if we choose to exercise it, could enable us
                        to change <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> nuclear policy, with
                        attendant benefits in a broader nonproliferation context. While the costs of
                        such action may be high, we should seriously weigh them against the dangers
                        that a South Korean nuclear weapons program would present.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendations</p>
                    <p>The specific actions I believe ought to be taken in the very near future
                        are:</p>
                    <p>—Using our influence in <hi rend="italic">South Korea</hi> to keep that
                        country, for the time being, from moving towards a nuclear weapons
                        capability. I would recommend that you request an interagency study, on an
                        urgent basis, to provide you with an assessment of specific policy options
                        (Tab A).</p>
                    <p>—Informing the <hi rend="italic">Japanese Government</hi> that we want them
                        to ratify the Non-Proliferation Treaty, so as to correct their mistaken
                        impression that we are rather indifferent. I recommend we do the same for
                        the Italian Government, should it fail to ratify soon (Tab B and C).</p>
                    <p>In light of the far-ranging implications for our overall arms control and
                        defense policies and in view of Congressional attitudes on nuclear
                        technology transfer, I would recommend the key issues regarding
                        proliferation be taken up at an <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> meeting
                        in the near future.</p>

                        Delegation.</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Summary:</hi> Spring 1975 session of the Conference of

                        Mar 4 in Geneva, will have fuller agenda than last year. Besides holdover
                        items of chemical weapons limitations and comprehensive nuclear test ban, as
                        result of 1974 <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> General Assembly
                        resolutions <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> will take up two new
                        subjects—environmental modification and arms control implications of
                        peaceful nuclear explosions—and will organize an experts’ study of the
                        question of nuclear free zones. In addition, recent congressional
                        legislation requires <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> action at this
                            <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> session to promote consideration of
                        conventional weapons limitations. This message outlines our approach to main
                        issues likely to arise during spring session. Detailed guidance will be
                        provided on specific topics as needed.</p>
                    <p>2. Environmental Modification: <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and
                        Soviet officials convened for second time February 24 to discuss restraints
                        on military use of En Mod, pursuant to agreement at 1974 summit. <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has presented draft multilateral
                        convention for Sovs’ consideration, without, however, taking decision that
                        convention is necessarily best vehicle for international En Mod restraints.
                        If that decision proves affirmative, and were Soviets ultimately to accept
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> approach as basis for joint <gloss
                            target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> initiative, the two countries conceivably
                        could present an agreed draft to <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> as
                        basis for negotiation pursuant to 1974 <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1"

                        would table draft text they introduced at <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1"

                            <gloss target="#t_Del_1">Del</gloss> should, as appropriate, reaffirm
                        our intention to engage in serious examination of relevant issues, while
                        noting that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> has not yet decided whether
                        effective measures to limit En Mod should take form of international
                        agreement. <gloss target="#t_Del_1">Del</gloss> should, when appropriate,
                        point out that <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has already unilaterally
                        renounced hostile use of climate modification. While taking care not to
                        promote interest in Soviet draft convention, in response to queries del
                        should note that it contains elements we cannot accept. Pending further
                        guidance, in any discussion of topic del should bear in mind <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> position that consideration of possible
                        measures on En Mod should focus on limiting military use of applications
                        having widespread, long-lasting or severe effects.</p>

                        Overriding objective for del, accordingly, will be to ensure that <gloss

                        study will involve highly-charged political issues not susceptible to

                            >UNGA</gloss> in having study entrusted to <gloss target="#t_CCD_1"

                        tactics paper indicates, we favor organizing study in manner that will
                        permit adequate control of project by <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss>
                        while permitting participants opportunity to state views, including
                        individual dissents. Objective is a study that will contribute to general

                        adequately reflecting <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> views and that will

                            >CTB</gloss>. However, del should as appropriate (e.g. in response to

                        verification requires some on-site inspection remains unchanged.</p>
                    <p>7. To avoid provoking queries about ongoing bilateral TTB/PNE negotiations,
                        del should take no initiative to raise <gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss>
                        with other dels. If others raise matter, however, del should avoid any
                        appearance of defensiveness and should be prepared to counter criticisms,
                        using <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> tactics paper guidance as well as
                        questions and answers to be provided separately. (Qs and As are now in

                    <p>9. Conventional Arms: Section 51(a) of Foreign Assistance Act of 1974
                        expresses sense of Congress that recent growth in conventional arms
                        transfers to developing countries is cause for grave concern; urges
                        President to propose that <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> consider as
                        high priority agenda item limitations on conventional arms transfers and
                        establishing mechanism for monitoring such limitations; and directs
                        President to report to Congress within six months after enactment of act
                        (i.e., by June 30, 1975) on steps taken to carry out this legislation.</p>
                    <p>10. Opening <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> statement will reiterate our

                        conventional arms control problems and refer to intention to raise subject
                        later in session. Statement on conventional arms (designed to meet
                        congressional requirements) will be provided del at later date.</p>

                        should informally renew our previous support for Swedish advocacy of greater
                        openness in reporting military expenditures. Annex to <gloss
                            target="#t_UNSYG_1">UNSYG</gloss> experts’ report on reduction of
                        military budgets (<gloss target="#t_ROB_1">ROB</gloss>) (prepared by <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> expert) made several useful points in this
                        connection and may be drawn upon. We wish to consider further the
                        possibility of a formal intervention on this subject later in session and
                        would welcome del’s recommendations.</p>
                    <p>12. Additional <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> Enlargement: There may be
                        pressure from one or more countries—notably Australia and possibly Ghana—for
                        their early inclusion in Committee. If subject is raised, del should explain
                        that in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> view Committee needs time to
                        assimilate recent enlargement by five members. If others ask general
                        attitude of <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> toward question of
                        additional enlargement, del should respond that we consider that <gloss
                            target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> cannot remain effective multilateral
                        negotiating forum unless it is limited in size. We would want to weigh
                        carefully whether any <pb n="409" facs="0443" xml:id="pg_409"/>further
                        enlargement should be considered in interest of broader representation if
                        this would mean loss in effectiveness.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The Threshold Test Ban <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> talks are
                        progressing more rapidly than expected. The Soviets have moved considerably
                        toward the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> position. They have:</p>
                    <p>—Agreed in principle to a yield limit on individual <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> shots, probably shot below 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1"
                            >KT</gloss>, so long as the total yield of a “salvo” is unlimited.</p>
                    <p>—Agreed to permit observers, including rights to make on-site seismic
                        measurements, provided the observers are couched or participants under a
                        “cooperative” agreement.</p>
                    <p>Thus, on both major aspects of our position—yield limits on <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> and on-site observers—the Soviets have
                        made major moves in our direction. The chances are high that some form of
                        agreement could be concluded before the Summit.</p>
                    <p>Soviet motivation is unclear. I suspect that <persName corresp="#p_MID_1"
                            >Morokhov</persName> has concluded that a <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> agreement would legitimize his <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> program and protect it from opposition within the Soviet
                        bureaucracy. He apparently faces considerable opposition within the Soviet
                        government; at one of Paul Dody’s recent “Pugwash” meetings, one of
                            <persName corresp="#p_MID_1">Morokhov</persName>’s men was opposed
                        openly by members of the Academy of Sciences when he took <pb n="410"
                            facs="0444" xml:id="pg_410"/>a strong advocacy position in favor of
                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>. There are other similar instances
                        where splits in the Soviet ranks have been evident.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets movement toward our position means you may wish to reassess our
                        policy toward the <gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss>, before we are locked
                        into a completed deal. We now have to take seriously the possibility that
                        the <gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss> will be ready for submission to
                        Congress later this year.</p>
                    <p>As I see it, you have two alternatives:</p>
                    <p>—Let the present course of events continue and submit the <gloss
                            target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss> for ratification once it is
                        negotiated.</p>
                    <p>—Try to “enhance” the <gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss>, either by adding
                        provisions which would call for follow-on <gloss target="#t_CTB_1"
                            >CTB</gloss> negotiations, or by explicit provisions to the agreement
                        which would result in an eventual <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>, say
                        5–10 years later.</p>
                    <p>If we proceed on the present course, there will probably be a considerable
                        ratification fight, although in the end, the treaty will probably be
                        ratified. Opponents will argue that the high threshold is counterproductive
                        to real arms control and that the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        agreement “legitimizes” pernicious <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>,
                        harming non-proliferation efforts. On the other hand, completing the
                        agreement will clearly signal to the Soviets that the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> sticks to its word, and it would represent
                        another step in improving relations. Everyone—on both the Soviet and
                        American sides—acknowledges that the agreement has only limited military
                        significance.</p>
                    <p>“Enhancing” the treaty by adding either general or specific <gloss
                            target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> provisions would make it considerably more
                        attractive to the Congress and the public (with the exception of some
                        element in the weapons development community). And in the long run, a <gloss
                            target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> would have some military significance by
                        gradually eroding the confidence each side has in its first strike
                        capabilities. Nevertheless, four major problems remain with the <gloss
                            target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">

                            >PNEs</gloss> would be a sham.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Verification.</hi> Our verification capability is

                        although we could probably keep it far short of their desires for nuclear

                    <quote>
                        <p>As the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament begins its 1975
                            deliberations, I would like to extend my best wishes and express my
                            fervent hope that its work this year will add new achievements to the
                            Committee’s substantial record.</p>
                        <p>The accomplishments of previous sessions have earned the respect of
                            nations throughout the world. The General Assembly of the United Nations
                            has entrusted to the Committee some of the most important and complex
                            problems of our time. The dedication and seriousness of <pb n="412"
                                facs="0446" xml:id="pg_412"/>purpose that have characterized the
                            work of the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> have made it a most
                            effective multilateral forum for dealing with arms control and
                            disarmament questions.</p>
                        <p>The Committee’s work resumes this year at a significant moment. One of
                            its accomplishments, the Convention on the Prohibition of the
                            Development, Production, and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological)
                            and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction, is about to enter into
                            force. The Convention is a positive measure of the progress that can be
                            made through responsible and constructive international negotiation.</p>
                        <p>A great many tasks—some continuing, some new—face the <gloss
                                target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss>. Few have simple solutions. No one can
                            guarantee that agreed solutions can be achieved for every issue. For its
                            part, the United States will do all in its power to promote agreement
                            wherever and whenever possible.</p>
                        <p>I am confident that this Committee, through the constructive dialogue
                            that is its hallmark, will continue to make its valuable contribution to
                            the promotion of peace and security through effective arms-control
                            measures.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>We are resuming our work at a time when disarmament efforts are receiving
                        increasing attention in the search for a more stable and secure world.
                        Convincing evidence of the growing interest in arms control solutions to
                        national and international security problems can be found in the extensive
                        treatment of disarmament questions at the 29th U.N. General Assembly. It is
                        also reflected in the unprecedented number of international meetings which
                        are currently dealing with the subject.</p>
                    <p>Here in Geneva, Soviet and American negotiators are working out the specific
                        provisions of a second-stage <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        [Strategic Arms Limitation Talks] agreement, the broad outlines of which
                        were agreed at the Vladivostok summit. In Moscow, representatives of the
                        United States and the Soviet Union are engaged in discussions aimed at
                        reaching the agreement governing peaceful nuclear explosions that is called
                        for in article III of the Threshold Test Ban Treaty. In Washington,
                        representatives of the two countries have been considering the question of
                        effective measures of restraint on environmental modification techniques. In
                        Vienna, members of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and the Warsaw
                        Pact are continuing their efforts to reach agreement on mutual and balanced
                        force reductions in Central Europe. In addition, the International Atomic
                        Energy Agency is the focal point for international examination of safeguards
                        on the peaceful uses of nuclear technology and of various aspects of
                        peaceful nuclear explosions. Finally, two months from now the conference to
                        review the operation of the Nonproliferation Treaty (<gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>) will begin in Geneva.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> occupies a unique and important
                        position in this overall effort. In 1975 our newly enlarged Committee can
                        expect a heavier <pb n="413" facs="0447" xml:id="pg_413"/>workload than it
                        has had in several years. The 29th General Assembly of the United Nations,
                        in addition to urging the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> to continue
                        its work on a comprehensive test ban and chemical weapons limitations,
                        called on the Committee to examine questions that have so far received
                        relatively little attention in this forum; namely, environmental
                        modification for military purposes, nuclear-free zones, and the arms control
                        implications of peaceful nuclear explosions (<gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNEs</gloss>). My delegation welcomes these new responsibilities and is
                        confident that the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> can make a valuable
                        contribution in each of these fields.</p>
                    <p>Among the large number of items on the international disarmament agenda, the
                        most pressing, in our view, concern nonproliferation and related nuclear
                        issues. My government was gratified that at the 29th U.N. General Assembly
                        many nations recognized that there is serious cause for concern in the
                        prospect of the further spread of independent nuclear explosive
                        capabilities. The United States feels that the wide support given to the
                        Nonproliferation Treaty and the many calls for broader adherence to that
                        treaty were constructive developments.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, a large number of delegations recognized that the
                        prevention of the further spread of nuclear-weapons capabilities cannot be
                        taken for granted and that a broad and determined international effort is
                        needed to strengthen the nonproliferation regime.</p>
                    <p>My government is urgently considering what courses of action would contribute
                        most effectively to achieving a more universal, reliable system of
                        safeguards against diversion of nuclear materials and technology to military
                        purposes. It is also considering what would be the most promising steps to
                        increase the political and economic incentives which could lead a country to
                        forgo the nuclear explosive option. My government looks to the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> Review Conference to assess how well the
                        treaty has functioned in the first five years of its existence, to consider
                        how the treaty can be more effectively implemented, and to provide an
                        impetus for the broadly based effort that will be essential if we are to
                        avoid a proliferation of nuclear powers.</p>

                        <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        Steps To Curb Nuclear Arms Race</p>
                    <p>The Review Conference will be concerned not only with the operation of those
                        provisions of the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> that deal directly
                        with the spread of nuclear-weapons capabilities but also with the
                        implementation of those provisions that were designed to halt and reverse
                        the nuclear arms race, notably article VI. In this connection I am pleased
                        to note that, since the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> last met, the
                        United States and the Soviet Union have taken another major step to curb
                        their competition in nuclear arms. At Vladivostok President <persName
                            corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> and General Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> set firm and equal numerical
                        limits on the strategic forces of both sides. Specifically, they agreed to
                        put a ceiling of 2,400 on the total number <pb n="414" facs="0448"
                            xml:id="pg_414"/>of intercontinental ballistic missiles,
                        submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers for each country.
                        They also agreed on a maximum number of 1,320 launchers for missiles that
                        could be armed with multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles (<gloss
                            target="#t_MIRV_1">MIRVs</gloss>). With the agreement to place all these
                        strategic delivery vehicles under the ceiling and to set an additional limit
                        on <gloss target="#t_MIRV_1">MIRVs</gloss>, this general framework for a new
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> accord goes well beyond the scope
                        of the interim agreement concluded in 1972.</p>
                    <p>Because of this breakthrough at Vladivostok, for the first time in the
                        nuclear age each side’s strategic calculations and force planning will not
                        be motivated by fear and uncertainty about a possible open-ended strategic
                        buildup by the other side. Instead, they can be based with confidence on
                        firm, established parameters. This can be expected to make a valuable
                        contribution to the stability of the strategic relationship.</p>
                    <p>Of perhaps greater long-range importance, the ceilings worked out by the
                        leaders of the two countries will provide a solid foundation for negotiating
                        future arms reductions. While many details remain to be settled before this
                        general framework can be transformed into a new agreement, the United States
                        is confident that such an agreement can be concluded this year and that
                        further negotiations on reducing the force ceilings can follow soon
                        thereafter.</p>
                    <p>My government is aware of the importance attached internationally to a
                        comprehensive test ban as a means of curbing the nuclear arms race. The
                        United States remains firmly committed to seeking an adequately verified
                        comprehensive test ban. The Threshold Test Ban Treaty, negotiated in Moscow
                        last summer, is not only a step toward that objective but will be in itself
                        a significant constraint on the nuclear arms competition between the United
                        States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>

                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> have yet to be resolved and that the use
                        of <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> is a highly complicated matter both
                        politically and legally. Recognizing these facts, the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> delegation at the recent General Assembly
                        called for thorough international consideration of the <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> question. We accordingly supported the
                        Assembly’s request in resolution 3261D that the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1"
                            >CCD</gloss> consider the arms control implications of peaceful nuclear
                        explosions.</p>
                    <p>Those implications have two aspects: implications for the development and
                        testing of nuclear weapons by nuclear-weapon states and implications for the
                        spread of nuclear-weapons capabilities among non-nuclear-weapon states.</p>
                    <pb n="415" facs="0449" xml:id="pg_415"/>
                    <p>With respect to the first of these categories, it is clearly important to
                        insure that nuclear explosions carried out ostensibly for peaceful purposes
                        are not used to gain weapons-related information in circumvention of agreed
                        limitations on weapons testing. This is the central task of the bilateral
                        negotiations now underway in Moscow, where the two sides are discussing
                        criteria to insure that <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> are consistent
                        with the Threshold Test Ban Treaty. An analogous question arises with
                        respect to any form of international test ban agreement. Indeed, this
                        question would be particularly crucial with a comprehensive test ban, since
                        in the absence of any authorized weapons testing, there would be a greater
                        incentive to seek weapons information in the course of a <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> program.</p>
                    <p>With respect to <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> implications for the
                        spread of nuclear-weapons capabilities, my government’s firm conviction
                        remains that it would be impossible for a non-nuclear-weapon state to
                        develop a nuclear explosive device for peaceful purposes without in the
                        process acquiring a device that could be used as a nuclear weapon. It has
                        been argued that the critical factor is not the capability to produce
                        nuclear devices but the intention of the country producing the device.
                        However, this is not the issue. The critical question is not whether we can
                        accept the stated intentions of any country, but whether a world in which
                        many states have the capability to carry out nuclear explosions—and in which
                        all therefore fear the nuclear-weapons capability of others—would not be
                        vastly less secure than a world that has successfully contained the spread
                        of nuclear explosive technology.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Study of Nuclear-Free Zones</p>
                    <p>A notable development at the last General Assembly was the heightened
                        interest in nuclear-free zones. Resolutions were adopted dealing with
                        nuclear-free-zone proposals for South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa and
                        with the Latin American Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty. Reflecting this renewed
                        interest, and motivated in part by the diversity of the regional initiatives
                        and the complexity of some of the issues involved, the General Assembly
                        requested that an ad hoe group of governmental experts, under <gloss
                            target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> auspices, undertake a comprehensive study
                        of the question of nuclear-free zones in all its aspects.</p>
                    <p>My delegation welcomes this step and hopes it will contribute to a better
                        understanding of the wide range of issues relating to nuclear-free zones.
                        Given the differences that exist from region to region, we think it would be
                        unrealistic to expect the experts to reach agreement on requirements for
                        nuclear-free-zone arrangements that could be applied universally. One useful
                        purpose of the study might be to identify issues where standardized
                        provisions could be feasible, and others where they would not.</p>
                    <pb n="416" facs="0450" xml:id="pg_416"/>
                    <p>Unlike earlier studies undertaken under the auspices of the Secretary
                        General, the study of nuclear-free zones will involve issues that are by
                        nature primarily political rather than technical. This is the first such
                        study to be carried out under the auspices of the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1"
                            >CCD</gloss>, and it was entrusted to this body with the understanding
                        that a number of states not represented in the Committee would participate.
                        My delegation has developed a number of ideas on the organization of this
                        project which we will be discussing with members of the Committee in the
                        next few days.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Restraints on Chemical and Biological Weapons</p>
                    <p>Turning to the area of restraints on chemical and biological weapons, I am
                        pleased to be able to report two important actions recently taken by the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government. On January 22 President
                            <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> signed the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> instrument of ratification of the Geneva
                        Protocol of 1925. I should point out that, although not party to the
                        protocol in the past, my government has always observed its principles and
                        objectives.</p>
                    <p>The President also signed on January 22 the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> instrument of ratification of the Biological Weapons
                        Convention, a product of the expert and painstaking efforts of this
                        Committee. As members of the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> are aware,
                        this convention is the first agreement since World War II to provide for the
                        actual elimination of an entire class of weapons; namely, biological agents
                        and toxins. With ratification procedures already completed by the three
                        depositary governments and by many more than the required 19 additional
                        governments, we expect the convention to enter into force in the very near
                        future. It is our hope that this will prompt many other governments to
                        adhere to the convention.</p>
                    <p>As members of the Committee are aware, article II of the Biological Weapons
                        Convention requires parties to destroy or to divert to peaceful purposes, as
                        soon as possible but not later than nine months after entry into force, all
                        agents, equipment, and means of delivery prohibited in article I. In this
                        connection I would like to state that the entire <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> stockpile of biological and toxin agents and weapons has
                        already been destroyed and our former biological warfare facilities have
                        been converted to peaceful uses. My delegation, and I am sure other members
                        of the Committee, would welcome similar confirmations of implementation of
                        article II from parties to the convention.</p>
                    <p>The ratification of the Geneva Protocol and the ratification and entry into
                        force of the Biological Weapons Convention are viewed by my government as
                        significant steps toward our common objective of the effective prohibition
                        of chemical and biological weapons.</p>
                    <p>My delegation is prepared at the current session to participate in the active
                        examination of possibilities for further effective restraints on chemical
                        weapons. An important element in this examination should <pb n="417"
                            facs="0451" xml:id="pg_417"/>continue to be a thorough analysis of the
                        verification question in relation to the possible scope of any
                        prohibition.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> interest in overcoming the dangers
                        of the use of environmental modification techniques for military purposes
                        was reflected in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet summit
                        joint statement of July 3, 1974, in which both countries advocated the most
                        effective measures possible to accomplish that objective. At the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> General Assembly last fall my government
                        indicated that it would be ready at the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss>
                        to consider this subject further. We pointed out that little is known about
                        the scientific and technological aspects of environmental modification and
                        that many of the applications posed for discussion are at present only
                        hypothetical. At the same time we stressed that we were prepared to
                        participate actively and positively in further discussion of this matter. We
                        would expect to contribute to the Committee’s deliberations in that
                        spirit.</p>
                    <p>In my statement today I have discussed a number of new responsibilities to be
                        assumed by the Committee. There is another issue I think should be added to
                        the list: the question of restraints on conventional arms. This Committee
                        has always given the highest priority to the control of weapons of mass
                        destruction. While my delegation regards this as entirely appropriate, we
                        see no reason why possible controls on conventional weapons, which account
                        for the largest share of world military expenditures, cannot be considered
                        concurrently. I plan to return to this subject in a later intervention.</p>

                        instrument of our time and said it is necessary to develop international
                        cooperation both in field of peaceful application of nuclear energy and in
                        preventing nuclear weapons proliferation. He noted with satisfaction that

                    <p>3. Referring to 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty, <persName corresp="#p_RAA_2"
                            >Roshchin</persName> said fact that control over the observance of this

                        the complete cessation of underground nuclear tests, a form of control may
                        be established on the basis of the experience derived from the elaboration
                        of the control system for the <gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss>. Such an
                        approach does not require international inspections. Turning to <gloss

                        agreed solutions to issues before the committee wherever and whenever
                        possible. In his own statement, <persName corresp="#p_MJJ_1"
                            >Martin</persName> commented that most pressing of large number of items
                        on international agenda concerned nonproliferation and related nuclear
                        issues. He said <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government is urgently
                        considering what courses of action would contribute most effectively to
                        achieving a more universal, reliable system of safeguards against diversion
                        of nuclear material and technology to military purposes. It is also
                        considering what would be most promising steps to increase political and
                        economic incentives which could lead a country to forego nuclear explosive
                        option.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_MJJ_1">Martin</persName> noted that since <gloss
                            target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> had last met, <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> and Soviet Union had taken, at Vladivostok, another major
                        step to curb their competition in nuclear arms. Because of this
                        breakthrough, for first time in nuclear age each side’s strategic
                        calculations and force planning will not be motivated by fear and
                        uncertainty about a possible open-ended strategic buildup by the other side.
                        While many details remain to be settled before general framework arrived at
                        Vladivostok can be transformed into a new agreement, <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> is confident that such an agreement can be concluded this
                        year and that further negotiations on reducing the force ceilings can follow
                        soon thereafter. He added that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                        remains firmly committed to seeking an adequately verified <gloss
                            target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss>,
                        negotiated in Moscow last year, is not only a step toward that objective,
                        but will be a significant constraint on the nuclear arms competition by the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"

                    <p>7. Amb <persName corresp="#p_MJJ_1">Martin</persName> commented that a number

                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> is a highly complicated matter
                        both politically and legally. <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> supported
                        recent <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> resolution requesting <gloss

                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>. It is clearly important to insure
                        that nuclear explosions carried out ostensibly for peaceful purposes are not
                        used to gain weapons-related information in circumvention of agreed
                        limitations on weapons testing. This is central task of bilateral

                        the process acquiring a device that could be used as a nuclear weapon.</p>

                        study of nuclear-free zones. He said it would be unrealistic to expect
                        experts to reach an agreement on requirements for nuclear-free zone
                        arrangements that could be applied universally. Study, however, might be

                        on conventional arms at <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> would be
                        desirable and appropriate and that he would return to this subject at later

                        alleged failure to carry out arms control commitments. He posed 13
                        tendentious questions to Soviets and <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        concerning the Threshold Test Ban Treaty and current <gloss

                        statement had already answered some of these and expressed hope that this
                        was sign of willingness to be responsive and forthcoming on the rest (text
                        pouched). Turning to subject of ad hoc group for study of nuclear-free
                        zones, <persName corresp="#p_GRA_1">Garcia Robles</persName> expressed view
                        the group should be fully autonomous in its work and assume full
                        responsibility for the study it was to prepare. Group could, if it wished,
                        consult the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> at the outset to learn what

                        that part of the study which “as usual, would include conclusions and
                        recommendations.” The group’s consultations with the <gloss
                            target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> should take place through informal
                        meetings and without the exercise of the co-chairmanship. Designation of

                        this question should be the result of exchanges at informal meetings of the

                        demonstrates necessity of pressing forward with urgency on issue of chemical

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">ISSUE</hi>: (S/SEN) On February 18, 1975, Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName> provided me with his recent
                        memorandum for the President (Tab A), which suggests several urgent
                        anti-nuclear proliferation proposals.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">DISCUSSION:</p>
                    <p>(S/SEN) In summary, the <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> paper finds a
                        number of nations giving out signals which can be interpreted as indicating
                        that they are considering developing a nuclear weapon capability. Several
                        proposals are advanced that could inhibit or delay this nuclear
                        proliferation. They are (1) to use our influence in South Korea to keep that
                        country from moving toward a nuclear weapon capability (<gloss
                            target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> recommends an urgent interagency study
                        to provide policy options), (2) to inform the Japanese and Italian
                        governments that we want them to ratify the Non-Proliferation Treaty in time
                        for the May 5, 1975 <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> Review Conference,
                        and (3) to take up key proliferation issues at an <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"
                            >NSC</gloss> meeting in the near future.</p>
                    <p>(S/SEN) Although I am in basic agreement with the <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1"
                            >ACDA</gloss> proposals, I would consider the possibilities of using
                        somewhat more forceful means of persuasion with the Japanese and Italian
                        governments to obtain timely ratification than are suggested in the <gloss
                            target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> paper.</p>
                    <p>(S/SEN) With regard to other countries which are leaning toward gaining
                        nuclear capabilities, we should initiate the “country studies” <pb n="423"
                            facs="0457" xml:id="pg_423"/>as recommended in the response to <gloss
                            target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 202. These studies would investigate all
                        the factors affecting potential nuclear weapons decisions in key non-nuclear
                        weapons states and the preferred strategy for deferring such decisions. The
                        situation in South Korea is particularly important and it is proposed that
                        all possible policy alternatives be examined on an urgent basis.</p>
                    <p>RECOMMENDATION: (U) It is recommended that you support the <gloss
                            target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> proposals, indicating a somewhat more
                        forceful position, as described above. Your support would appropriately come
                        as a memorandum from you to the Secretary of State (Tab B).</p>

                        harmonizing views of supplier coun<pb n="425" facs="0459" xml:id="pg_425"
                        />tries, “after efforts of several months and in light of the reaction of
                        other states,” and that in any event, if all suppliers obtained conditions
                        and principles equivalent to these, this would be a step forward. Note said
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> saw little prospect of achieving
                        more comprehensive agreement among relevant supplier countries and said
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> therefore “believed that in view of
                        the legitimate interests of our nuclear industry the conclusion of the
                        agreement with Brazil should not be delayed any longer.”</p>
                    <p>2. <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> note also answered specific questions
                        we had posed concerning projected <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                        >FRG</gloss>-Brazil agreement (para 5 <gloss target="#t_REFReftel_1"
                            >reftel</gloss>). <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> responses
                        indicated that no controls on plutonium were envisioned over and above
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards except for prior
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> consent to re-export. Note cited
                        both Brazilian and German opinion that all technology developed in
                        connection with <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>-Brazil cooperation
                        would be subject to <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards.
                        However it said implementation of this principle would be determined in the
                        safeguards agreement and that this would be negotiated between Brazil and
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> (without <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                            >FRG</gloss> participation). Agreement would preclude use of covered
                        material for any explosive device.</p>
                    <p>3. <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> note confirmed that cooperation
                        agreement envisaged provision of both uranium enrichment and reprocessing
                        facilities. It said that “concerning uranium enrichment, we have excluded
                        the particularly sensitive centrifuge technology” but there was
                        consideration of use of the nozzle separation process. Note concluded that
                        at industrial level, “there will be joint ventures which will offer
                        additional safeguards.”</p>

                        agreement would be especially awkward in light of fact that Iran is a full
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> party while Brazil refused to
                        support the treaty.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Von Staden</persName> said <gloss

                        reach and thought safeguards were good. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1"
                            >Iklé</persName> recalled some of weaknesses in safeguards system itself
                        including inadequate staff of inspectors, and mentioned even greater
                        uncertainties likely to surround inspection of complex facilities such as
                        reprocessing plants. He noted lack of economic rationale for these
                        facilities in countries like Brazil, which should give rise to question
                        about their motives for seeking them. <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>

                    <p>(S/SEN) I have studied the <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> memorandum
                        for the President on nuclear proliferation, dated February 18, 1975.</p>
                    <p>(S/SEN) Although I am in basic agreement with the <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1"
                            >ACDA</gloss> proposals, I would consider the possibility of using
                        somewhat more forceful means of persuasion with the Japanese and Italian
                        governments to obtain timely ratification than are suggested in the <gloss
                            target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> paper.</p>
                    <p>(S/SEN) With regard to other countries which are leaning toward gaining
                        nuclear capabilities, we should initiate the “country studies” as
                        recommended in the response to <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 202.
                        These studies would investigate all the factors affecting potential nuclear
                        weapons decisions in key non-nuclear weapons states and the preferred
                        strategy for deferring such decisions. The situation in South Korea is
                        particularly important and it is proposed that all possible policy
                        alternatives be examined on an urgent basis.</p>
                    <p>(U) The Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, concurs with me on this

                        <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 219 dated March 14, 1975 requested a
                        study of the issues involved in reaching an acceptable Agreement for
                        Cooperation with Iran concerning nuclear cooperation. While negotiations are
                        proceeding a number of key issues remain unresolved. Accordingly, this paper
                        reviews the current situation and possible options for the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to consider.</p>
                    <p>In brief, we are facing a serious dilemma since we are proposing to Iran more
                        rigorous controls over plutonium than we have heretofore included in our
                        other agreements including those with states that are not party to the
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>. While these special safeguards
                        might be satisfactory to Congress they are proving unacceptable to Iran
                        since the <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> views them as discriminatory,
                        in light of her status as an <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> party. Our
                        problem, therefore, is to devise a formulation that will prove acceptable to
                        both Iran as well as prospective congressional critics while preserving our
                        nonproliferation objectives.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">BACKGROUND</p>
                    <p>Iran is embarking on a major 20,000 <gloss target="#t_MW_1">MW</gloss>
                        nuclear power program and is interested in acquiring half of this capacity
                        (or about 6 to 8 major nuclear power plants) from the United States. The
                        estimated revenues to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> from this
                        arrangement is $6.4 billion, taking into account reactor components, fuel
                        supply and related services. The <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> also
                        is prepared to contribute to 20% of the cost of the proposed <gloss
                            target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss> private enrichment plant. This would
                        represent a flow of roughly an additional $1 billion to the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> should the <gloss target="#t_UEA_1"
                            >UEA</gloss> plant actually materialize.</p>
                    <p>Iran has decided now to introduce nuclear power to prepare against the
                        time—about 15 years in the future when Iranian oil production is expected to
                        begin to decline sharply. The introduction of nuclear power <pb n="428"
                            facs="0462" xml:id="pg_428"/>will both provide for the growing needs of
                        Iran’s economy and free remaining oil reserves for export or conversion to
                        petrochemicals.</p>
                    <p>Our ability to reach a mutually satisfactory agreement with Iran on the
                        proposed nuclear accord is expected to have very considerable political as
                        well as economic importance to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Iranian
                        relationships, in view of the Shah’s interest in seeing Iran move into
                        high-technology fields with <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        cooperation. Conversely, failure on our part to resolve the remaining issues
                        could have serious short, as well as long-term, adverse effects in our
                        relations, given the Shah’s sensitivity towards <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> attitudes and Iran’s strong desires to be treated in a
                        non-discriminatory manner and as a nation that often has supported <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> interests.</p>
                    <p>Should we not be able to resolve our differences the Shah is likely to view
                        our unwillingness to treat Iran as we have other <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                            >NPT</gloss> parties as a reflection on Iran’s stability and the
                        integrity of its commitments as well as an indication that the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> cannot be relied upon because of the
                        uncertainties of our political process. We do not discount the possibility
                        that a continued impasse on the accord could result not only in a decision
                        on Iran’s part to transfer its nuclear business elsewhere, but also in a
                        more serious deterioration in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Iranian
                        relationships. Failure to reach agreement with Iran because of insistence on
                        restrictions which may prove unacceptable to them, could injure rather than
                        promote our nonproliferation objectives, by forcing Iran to rely on less
                        cautious suppliers.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, however, it must be stressed that the <gloss
                            target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> is now involved in a reassessment of
                        appropriate conditions for nuclear supply, and is discussing such conditions
                        with other nuclear suppliers. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        position in the negotiations with Iran, accordingly, must take these factors
                        fully into account.</p>
                    <p>There also is urgency to our reviewing and determining the definitive <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> position on the proposed Agreement if we
                        have any hope or interest in bringing this matter to a satisfactory
                        resolution by mid-May when the Shah arrives. If any issues are still
                        unresolved we can expect the Shah to personally raise them at that time. The
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> has expressed a receptivity to
                        receiving a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> team in Tehran during April
                        20–30 to resume the negotiations and one of the purposes of this study is to
                        facilitate our ability to give the negotiators suitable guidance.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">
                        <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and Iranian Positions</p>
                    <p>While Iran has given us comments on several secondary issues, the following
                        key issues are known to remain.</p>
                    <p>As an element of our growing concerns over nuclear proliferation, we have
                        given Iran a draft agreement that would be more rigorous in controlling
                        plutonium than our past agreements with other countries, but less sweeping
                        than the constraints we proposed to Israel and Egypt. <pb n="429"
                            facs="0463" xml:id="pg_429"/>Also, although we have never gone into
                        specifics we have informed key congressional representatives that the
                        Iranian agreement would be tougher than past <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> nuclear agreements but not as tough as the
                        Israeli-Egyptian formulations, out of deference to the fact that Iran is a
                        party to the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> and strong supporter of
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards. We can anticipate
                        very critical congressional scrutiny of any agreement that we might
                        negotiate with Iran based on congressional concerns over nuclear exports as
                        well as hostility towards the Shah’s oil pricing policies.</p>
                    <p>The key provision at issue between ourselves and Iran is one that would give
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> the right to determine where any
                        plutonium produced through the use of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        materials and equipment can be reprocessed, fabricated or stored. This is
                        more liberal than the Israeli-Egyptian formulation, which precluded local
                        reprocessing in those troubled countries, but harsher than the agreements we
                        have concluded to date with other nations including those that are not
                        parties to the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>. To date our agreements
                        have normally provided that the recipient state can reprocess the material
                        it receives subject only to a determination by both parties that the
                        facility would permit adequate safeguards to apply.</p>
                    <p>In the case of our proposed agreement with Iran we also have sought to temper
                        our request for a veto on reprocessing with a proposed note that would
                        inform the <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> that we would look
                        sympathetically on Iran’s request to perform such reprocessing services. We
                        have indicated that one factor favoring <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        approval would be a decision on the part of Iran to establish any
                        reprocessing plant on a multinational basis with the active involvement of
                        the country helping to establish the facility.</p>
                    <p>Some believe that a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> right to specify
                        where <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> fuels can be reprocessed should
                        be included in all of our future agreements, since it would provide the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> with added and prudent flexibility
                        to deal with the evolving proliferation problem. We also have created an
                        impression that the product of our Iranian agreement might become our future
                        model—especially for our dealings with <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>
                        parties. The proposition of encouraging foreign reprocessing ventures to
                        evolve on a multinational basis is consistent with the line we are currently
                        pursuing with other major equipment suppliers.</p>
                    <p>Iran, however, has expressed reservations that we should have any such veto
                        rights and desires to be treated no less advantageously than other <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> partners. More basically she, like others,
                        aspires to acquire her own complete fuel cycle capabilities (including an
                        enrichment capability) and believes that as a party to the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> she should not be deprived of this
                        opportunity.</p>
                    <p>When the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> was negotiated we stressed that
                        the states participating in the Treaty would be treated more advantageously
                        than non-<pb n="430" facs="0464" xml:id="pg_430"/>parties. Moreover, we
                        indicated that all legitimate peaceful efforts, including reprocessing,
                        could be pursued so long as they were adequately safeguarded. Thus, our
                        subjecting an <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> party, like Iran, to more
                        rigorous controls could be viewed as undermining the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> as well as confidence in <gloss
                            target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards. Also to place our postulated
                        constraints in perspective, it must be stressed that the technology of
                        chemical reprocessing has been unclassified since 1958 and is within reach,
                        at least on a pilot scale, of any determined country with a moderate
                        capability.</p>
                    <p>Balancing these considerations is a growing recognition that the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> should be reinforced by the adoption of
                        additive supplier restraints and more selective treatment of countries with
                        whom we cooperate. Other key countries of concern, such as Pakistan, are
                        pressing to acquire some reprocessing capability and some feel that an
                        overly receptive <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> reaction to Iran’s
                        desires, including abandonment of our veto proposal, could detract from any
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> efforts to discourage such
                        developments. Also, as noted, the reactions our proposals will receive in
                        the Congress could be crucial to the entire exercise.</p>
                    <p>Despite Iran’s present benign attitude towards the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                            >NPT</gloss> and non-proliferation some are concerned over her possible
                        longer-term nuclear weapon ambitions should others proliferate.</p>
                    <p>Canada has a nuclear agreement with Iran which gives it a right to approve
                        where Canadian supplied fuels can be reprocessed. Iran, reportedly is not
                        satisfied with this arrangement.</p>
                    <p>The constraints we have proposed for Iran are consistent with those we are
                        now exploring with other suppliers for application to potentially unstable
                        countries and non-parties to the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>. We
                        regard our proposed consultations with other suppliers to be a serious
                        endeavor. Accordingly, although it is recognized that other suppliers are
                        not as conservative as we are and that some may not be prepared to accept
                        all of our proposals, we do not wish our position with Iran to undercut
                        these broader consultations even though Iran has joined the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>. In the course of our consultations with
                        other suppliers we have strongly endorsed the concept, that foreign
                        reprocessing plants should be established on a multinational basis wherever
                        practicable. We have not, however, been explicitly pressing the idea that
                        suppliers have veto rights over the location of foreign plants processing
                        their materials. However, we have cited the Israeli-Egyptian cases as
                        examples of our growing concern with reprocessing.</p>
                    <p>In contrast to the issue over the veto, Iran appears to give less importance
                        to our proposal that any reprocessing plant should be established on a
                        multilateral basis. Conceivably the Shah might see benefits in hosting a
                        multinational reprocessing plant, perhaps with Pakistan involvement and with
                        some assurance of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> technical assist<pb
                            n="431" facs="0465" xml:id="pg_431"/>ance. Such an approach could
                        establish Iran early as a major reprocessing center, thus deterring national
                        plants in the region and providing economic, political and security benefits
                        to Iran. Some believe, however, that the proposition of urging others to
                        establish their safeguarded plants on a multilateral basis is only
                        marginally useful, bearing in mind that <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1"
                            >IAEA</gloss> safeguards already are multinational in character.</p>
                    <p>Regardless of what course of action we choose, our negotiations with Iran are
                        likely to collapse, with serious adverse effects, unless she can be
                        persuaded that she is not being subjected to discriminatory treatment.</p>
                    <p>If more rigorous controls were applied to all <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                            >NPT</gloss> countries as part of an overall program, Iran might not
                        object if she perceives that her non-proliferation interests, like ours, are
                        being fostered. This, however, will be directly related to how reasonable
                        she construes our proposals to be. Therefore, should we continue to press
                        for more rigorous controls our objective should be to convince Iran that the
                        measures we are proposing will further our common non-proliferation
                        objectives. We should also indicate that rather than discriminating against
                        Iran, we are seeking Iran’s assistance to formulating a model which will be
                        the basis for future agreements with other <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                            >NPT</gloss> states.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Fuel Supply</p>
                    <p>We also are facing some important but hopefully, more soluble issues with
                        Iran concerning other aspects of the proposed fuel supply. Iran desires to
                        receive <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> material for its own reactor
                        use as well as for fabrication in Iran for use in third countries with whom
                        we have agreements. <hi rend="italic">Since we have readily accommodated
                            such demands in the case of several other agreements we are prepared to
                            meet this latter request</hi>.</p>
                    <p>A more complicated issue relates to the overall quantities of fuel that we
                        should be prepared to furnish to Iran. Basically, three options have been
                        considered. Under <hi rend="italic">the first</hi>, we would stand firm on
                        the current 8000 <gloss target="#t_MW_1">MW</gloss> ceiling in the draft
                        agreement. Under <hi rend="italic">the second</hi>, we would be prepared to
                        raise the ceiling, slightly, to cover only the anticipated needs associated
                        with estimated total <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> reactor sales.
                        Under <hi rend="italic">the third</hi>, we would be prepared to permit
                        sufficient flexibility in the agreement to enable, but not oblige us, to
                        fuel non-<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> reactors as well. Two
                        significant sub-options have been identified in this latter regard. We could
                        raise the ceiling in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Iranian
                        Agreement to as high as 20,000 <gloss target="#t_MW_1">MW</gloss> should the
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> press the point. This would cover
                        all of Iran’s currently estimated reactor needs. Alternatively the agreement
                        might include a 8000 <gloss target="#t_MW_1">MW</gloss> to 10,000 <gloss
                            target="#t_MW_1">MW</gloss> ceiling plus a proviso that Iran could
                        receive such additional quantities for use in defined domestic Iranian
                        reactors as represent Iran’s contracted share of the product of any <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> facility in which it invests. Iran’s
                        proportionate share (20%) <pb n="432" facs="0466" xml:id="pg_432"/>of the
                            <gloss target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss> facility, which is equivalent to
                        27,000 <gloss target="#t_MW_1">MW</gloss>, would be more than sufficient to
                        enable it to meet all of its own needs.</p>
                    <p>To place this issue in perspective it should be stressed that the ceilings in
                        our agreements are permissive, and not obligatory, and simply set the outer
                        limits of what can be transferred. Generally, we have felt that it would
                        enhance <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> attractiveness as a fuel
                        supplier to be amenable to meeting the needs of foreign reactors regardless
                        of their origin, and thus support our non-proliferation objectives.</p>
                    <p>If the Iranians press to have the ceiling raised it would appear
                        counter-productive to rigidly adhere to the 8000 <gloss target="#t_MW_1"
                            >MW</gloss> ceiling since this figure would not even cover the fuel
                        requirements of the 10,000 <gloss target="#t_MW_1">MW</gloss> in <gloss

                        country out of the total 20,000 <gloss target="#t_MW_1">MW</gloss> program.
                        This would suggest that <hi rend="italic">as a minimum</hi> we should be
                        readily prepared to raise the ceiling to 10,000 <gloss target="#t_MW_1"
                            >MW</gloss> on the assumption that we would be fueling our own reactors
                        and that Iran’s investment in <gloss target="#t_EURODIF_1">EURODIF</gloss>
                        would enable it to meet the needs of its German and French reactors. Some
                        believe that this should be our preferred approach, in contrast to raising
                        our ceiling higher, since by raising our ceiling we could “free” Iran’s
                        share of <gloss target="#t_EURODIF_1">EURODIF</gloss> fuel for other
                        purposes (such as stockpiling or disposition) which might conceivably run
                        counter to our international energy objectives aimed at oil consumer
                        self-sufficiency.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, confining our ceiling to a 8000 <gloss target="#t_MW_1"
                            >MW</gloss> or 10,000 <gloss target="#t_MW_1">MW</gloss> figure would
                        automatically bar the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> from competing to
                        fuel a larger share of the Iranian program, and ignores the fact that the
                        ceilings in our agreements are permissive and not obligatory. It would also
                        appear to be inequitable to welcome Iranian investment in the <gloss

                        <gloss target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss> venture, which may be a crucial factor

                        indigenous reactor use. Moreover, any concerns about “stockpiling” could be
                        met by our adopting a policy that would provide that any <gloss

                        Department and <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> discussed with <gloss

                        Stelzenmuller <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> concerns re proposed
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> nuclear sale to Brazil. The
                        following points were made.</p>
                    <p>2. <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is concerned about supply of full
                        fuel cycle capabilities (enrichment and reprocessing) inherent in proposed
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> sale to Brazil. <gloss
                            target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> sale would set precedent for transfers to
                        both <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> and non-<gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                            >NPT</gloss> parties and set standards for specific provisions of such
                        sales, thus preempting the multilateral understanding on nuclear exports
                        that we are currently seeking.</p>
                    <p>3. The <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> has stated that the Brazil
                        agreement represents a step forward in nonproliferation efforts and there is
                        little prospect of getting more comprehensive agreement. <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> acknowledges that the conditions for sale
                        include many of the elements <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has
                        proposed: application of agency safeguards both to the supplied equipment,
                        supplied and produced materials and technology, provision prohibiting use of
                        these for nuclear explosives and provisions for adequate physical security.
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> also notes that <gloss
                            target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> has attempted to get further conditions
                        such as <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards on all Brazilian
                        nuclear activities and a general commitment not to develop or acquire
                        nuclear explosives, but has not been successful in this regard. Therefore,
                        while the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> acknowledges that the <gloss
                            target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> proposed conditions are extensive, they
                        also fall short of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> suggested policies.
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> feels <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                            >FRG</gloss> may be prejudging the outcome of possible multilateral
                        agreement and therefore urges that <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>
                        reconsider decision to proceed at this time.</p>
                    <p>4. If the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> nevertheless intends to
                        proceed with sale to Brazil, <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> suggests
                        the following additional elements be included in the covering agreement:</p>
                    <pb n="440" facs="0474" xml:id="pg_440"/>
                    <p>A) Provision for continuing involvement by the supplier in reprocessing and
                        enrichment programs, to include joint ownership, voice in policy decisions
                        and technical/operational presence.</p>
                    <p>B) Clear definition in bilateral agreement of guidelines for implementation
                        of <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards covering technology to
                        minimize possibility of legal questions concerning whose technology is
                        involved in developing new facilities.</p>
                    <p>C) Special provisions to assure effectiveness of <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1"
                            >IAEA</gloss> safeguards on enrichment and reprocessing plants,
                        including supplier concurrence on <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>
                        facility attachments, and limitation to low-enriched cascades.</p>
                    <p>D) Specific provision for application of bilateral safeguards by supplier
                        country if <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards are
                        removed.</p>
                    <p>E) Inclusion of provision for additional supplier control over timetable for
                        developing fuel cycle facilities, such as joint <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                            >FRG</gloss>/Brazil determination of appropriate developmental
                        schedule.</p>
                    <p>5. <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> planned on discussing the conditions
                        and terms highlighted above in context of a suppliers conference. Due to
                        imminence of proposed <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> sale, and in
                        light of joint interest in non-proliferation and previous productive <gloss

                        that we should discuss above conditions re this specific export case
                        bilaterally as soon as possible either in Washington or Bonn.</p>

                    <p>Recent fragmentary information developed during Army tests of some stockpiled
                            <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> munitions indicates that one of our
                        two nerve agents (VX) <hi rend="italic">may be</hi> deteriorating. If this
                        proves to be the case, the longevity of our stockpile would be questionable
                        and we might need binaries to maintain an acceptable stockpile.</p>
                    <p>We will not be able to evaluate and answer this question of deterioration for
                        several months, as additional testing is needed. It, therefore, seems
                        unlikely that we will be in a position to put the fundamental question on
                        binaries to the President before the summer.</p>
                    <p>Following last summer’s Summit, <persName corresp="#p_VY_1"
                            >Vorontsov</persName> delivered to you a Soviet draft of a <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> treaty. This draft treaty gives us trouble
                        because it calls for destruction of stockpiles, a ban on further production,
                        and a prohibition on <gloss target="#t_RD_1">R&amp;D</gloss>. Since most of
                        these measures are unverifiable, we clearly will not be able to go nearly as
                        far as the Soviets suggest in this draft.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets have periodically asked if we are prepared to discuss their draft
                        treaty or to undertake bilateral discussions of a joint <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> initiative as provided for by the Summit
                        Communiqué of July 3, 1974 and reaffirmed at Vladivostok. The Soviets are
                        anxious that we have <pb n="442" facs="0476" xml:id="pg_442"/>some bilateral
                        contact soon, and this would be helpful for the purpose of deflecting <gloss
                            target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> pressures.</p>
                    <p>All agencies agree that we should accede to this request and have Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJJ_1">Martin</persName> meet with Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAA_2">Roshchin</persName> during the next few
                        days. Since we are not in position to hold substantive talks on possible
                            <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> restrictions, the interagency
                        proposal is for <persName corresp="#p_MJJ_1">Martin</persName> to address
                        certain questions to <persName corresp="#p_RAA_2">Roshchin</persName>
                        concerning the Soviet draft treaty. We would also make a brief joint
                        statement at the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> noting that <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet contacts on <gloss target="#t_CW_1"

                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Begin text:</hi> This letter summarizes the second round
                        of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet negotiations on an agreement
                        governing nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes (<gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNEs</gloss>) in accordance with Article III of the Threshold Test Ban
                        Treaty (TTBT). The first round of these negotiations, which <pb n="443"
                            facs="0477" xml:id="pg_443"/>took place in Moscow from October 7 until
                        November 6, 1974 was summarized in letter to <gloss target="#t_NAC_1"
                            >NAC</gloss> dated 16 January 1975. The second round began in Moscow on
                        10 February 1975 and closed on March 22 for a working recess of about one
                        month.</p>
                    <p>3. In Round II the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> maintained, as in
                        Round I, its position that to be acceptable a TTBT/PNE agreement must
                        satisfy the following criteria, which were explicitly accepted by the
                        Soviets in Round II:</p>
                    <p>(A) <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> must not provide weapon-related
                        benefits otherwise precluded or limited by the TTBT.</p>
                    <p>(B) The fact that <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> activities are not
                        contributing to such benefits must be adequately verifiable.</p>
                    <p>(C) The agreement must be consistent with existing treaty obligations,
                        including the Limited Test Ban Treaty (<gloss target="#t_LTBT_1"
                            >LTBT</gloss>).</p>
                    <p>4. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> position on contained <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> remained as in Round I, namely, that:</p>
                    <p>(A) In view of the greater uncertainty to be expected in verifying the yields
                        of <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> (relative to that expected for
                        explosions at specified test sites) with national technical means, contained
                        explosions should be limited to a maximum yield of 100 kilotons.</p>
                    <p>(B) It is also necessary to verify that the local circumstances are
                        consistent with the stated peaceful purpose.</p>
                    <p>(C) The primary elements of yield verification for contained explosions are
                        teleseismic measurements, information exchange and observer functions. The
                        information exchange would include advance information on the purpose, date,
                        time, depth, yield, coordinates, and the real geological and geophysical
                        properties of the medium at and near the burst point, to include a
                        description of the geological section, and of the basic physical properties
                        of the lithologically distinct rock units present, such as: density, rock
                        strength, seismic velocity, porosity, degree of water saturation and depth
                        of water table. The statement of purpose would include a project plan, and a
                        schedule of activities related to the event which would include:</p>
                    <p>(1) A full and clear description of the planned event;</p>
                    <p>(2) Details on the explosives emplacements;</p>
                    <p>(3) Planned times of the emplacements;</p>
                    <p>(4) Planned times of individual and group explosion;</p>
                    <p>(5) Depths of burial of the explosives;</p>
                    <p>(6) Relationship to nearby geological features and other relevant features
                        which either influence the objectives of the explosion or constrain the
                        yields, depths or other characteristics.</p>
                    <p>(D) After the explosions, actual yields and results would be exchanged.</p>
                    <pb n="444" facs="0478" xml:id="pg_444"/>
                    <p>5. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> put forth its position on
                        excavation <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> as follows:</p>
                    <p>(A) Limit in the yield of a salvo of 500 kilotons.</p>
                    <p>(B) An unspecified limit on the yield of individual excavation explosions to
                        be agreed between the sides. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        delegation did not propose a specific number for this limit.</p>
                    <p>(C) A fission yield limit on each explosive.</p>
                    <p>(D) A specified minimum depth of burial.</p>
                    <p>(E) Provision for information exchange and observer functions in order to
                        augment national technical means of verification of all of the above limits.
                        Information exchange would be the same as listed in para 4 (C).</p>
                    <p>6. By the end of Round II the following Soviet proposals had been made:</p>
                    <p>(A) A yield limit of 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss> for single
                        contained events. The Soviets proposed that groups of contained explosions
                        be allowed with aggregate yields larger than the agreed upper limit on
                        single contained explosions if the group array is so designed that each
                        individual explosion in the group can be distinguished and its yield
                        measured by practical verification arrangements. The <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> agreed to consider this proposal.</p>
                    <p>(B) A limit of 500 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss> for individual
                        excavation explosions, with a small number to be allowed having yields above
                        the limit. No limit on the yield of excavation salvos, although there were
                        indications of flexibility on this point.</p>
                    <p>(C) The Soviets presented ideas on information exchange, based on the
                        following yield regions:</p>
                    <p>(1) Yield region one: individual and aggregate yields up to 50–70 <gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss>. Pre-shot information to be provided on
                        date, time, location, aggregate yield and purpose, post shot information or
                        actual yields and results.</p>
                    <p>(2) Yield region two: Individual and aggregate yields from 50–70 <gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss> to 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss>.
                        In addition to information exchange for yield region one, information
                        provided in yield region two would include depth, and geological and
                        geophysical data.</p>
                    <p>(3) Yield region three: Individual yields less than 150 <gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss>, aggregate yields greater than 150 <gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss>. In addition to preceding information, the
                        following additional information would be exchanged: number of explosives,
                        yield of each, and relative positions in space and time.</p>
                    <p>(4) Yield region four: Aggregate yields greater than 150 <gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss> and at least one individual yield greater
                        than 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss>. Additional data exchanged for
                        yield region four would include data on possible uncertainty in actual
                        yields.</p>
                    <pb n="445" facs="0479" xml:id="pg_445"/>
                    <p>(D) Indicated willingness to accept the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        proposals on limiting fission yield and depth of burial, but have not yet
                        indicated what verification provisions would be acceptable.</p>
                    <p>(E) In contrast to their attitude toward observers in Round I, the Soviets
                        now appear willing to accept observers for at least some <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> events provided that this can be described
                        in a framework of cooperation.</p>
                    <p>7. The Soviets placed less stress on <hi rend="roman">
                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> cooperation than in Round I. The

                            cooperation in principle; however necessary yield limitations and

                        among suppliers, would be detrimental to <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"

                        and could increase commercial pressure on suppliers to permit export of

                            target="#t_USDel_1">U.S. Del</gloss> urged that <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                            >FRG</gloss> not prejudge what might be agreed to multilaterally and
                        therefore delay agreement with Brazil on sensitive exports (but not
                        reactors) until safeguards and controls on these exports could be discussed
                        multilaterally and common understandings reached.</p>
                    <p>3. <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> said that they could not delay
                        decision very much longer, that common understandings did not look very
                        likely, and that they believed safeguard conditions negotiated with Brazil
                        exceeded possible common understandings. <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                            >FRG</gloss> stressed the major commercial significance of this sale of
                        reactors and said that Brazil would not make the reactor deal if enrichment
                        and reprocessing capabilities not included. <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                            >FRG</gloss> expressed concern that <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>

                            target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss>: Review of Spring Session.</p>
                    <p>1. During the spring session, which concluded on April 10, the <gloss
                            target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> did not engage in any concrete arms
                        control negotiations but it was the forum for several significant policy
                        statements. The committee also laid the groundwork for a very active summer
                        session and for the ad hoc study group on nuclear-free zones.</p>
                    <p>2. An unusually large number of informal meetings were held during this
                        session to deal with a variety of procedural matters. The informal meetings
                        proved to be a rather unwieldly means for reaching decisions and had to be
                        supplemented by intensive corridor consultations, but this type of meeting
                        has a growing attraction for many members of the committee. Part of this
                        attraction is no doubt due to the fact that the informal meetings were often
                        the scene of very lively and active exchanges in contrast with the
                        relatively unstimulating plenary sessions.</p>
                    <p>3. The spring session was also notable for the attention given to the <gloss
                            target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss>’s work methods. The large number of 1974
                        General Assembly arms control resolutions, which referred a number of new
                        issues to the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss>, prompted several
                        delegations (mostly the Canadians and Romanians) to urge that the committee
                        adopt a more systematic approach to its work in order to ensure that all
                        matters before it were dealt with adequately. These views were received
                        sympathetically by many members of the committee, particularly by the rather
                        large number of delegation heads who were making their first appearance at
                        the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss>. Several of these new
                        representatives, including the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>
                        Ambassador, were clearly dissatisfied with the committee’s lack of a
                        detailed, fixed agenda. In addition, the absence of concrete treaty
                        negotiations <pb n="448" facs="0482" xml:id="pg_448"/>naturally gave
                        delegations more time and reason for considering organizational and
                        procedural improvements. Despite these widespread desires for procedural
                        changes, only one formal proposal was put forward (by Romania) and it was
                        modest in scope. There was no efforts made to eliminate the co-chairmanship.
                        The new provisions covering work methods that were eventually adopted at the
                        April 10 plenary (Geneva 2472) were largely aimed at providing a more
                        predictable schedule for the committee’s annual sessions. Even on this
                        point, a new provision pertaining to future examination of the committee’s
                        work program was expressed in vague and general terms. Nonetheless, many
                        delegations probably share the hope expressed by the Mexican representative
                        that these changes will lead to more substantial modifications in the
                        committee’s procedures and organization.</p>
                    <p>4. The formal statements that were made during plenary meetings on
                        substantive issues broke little new ground and tended to be wide-ranging and
                        rather generalized. No new formal proposals or initiatives were put forward.
                        Several delegations, however, addressed the committee for the first time as
                        new members of the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss>, and among these the
                        representatives of Iran and the Federal Republic of Germany made notable
                        statements of their government’s attitude towards a variety of arms control
                        issues. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Rep also made a lengthy
                        statement on the question of possible restraints on conventional arms.
                        Otherwise, plenary statements tended to be repetitive and often indicated
                        that members of the committee were marking time and waiting for initiatives
                        from the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and/or Soviet Union on a
                        number of major issues before the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>5. The impatience of other delegates for such initiatives was particularly
                        evident in the case of chemical weapons. Soviet bloc, non-aligned and
                        Western delegations referred repeatedly to the fact that they were waiting
                        for the joint U.S./Soviet initiative on chemical weapons referred to in the
                        1974 Moscow Summit communiqué. Japanese Ambassador Nisibori, still
                        disgruntled because this reference in the communiqué had overshadowed his
                        delegation’s draft <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> convention, was
                        particularly insistent in his queries about the joint initiative. The
                        Soviets amplified their pressuring in bilateral contacts with us and it was
                        apparently only with some difficulty that the Soviets restrained themselves
                        from being more pointed in their plenary statement of the closing day
                        regarding the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> posture on the <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> issue. <gloss target="#t_USDel_1"
                            >USDel</gloss> thus found itself in a very awkward position regarding
                            <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> during the spring session, though
                        matters were helped somewhat by the fact that <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> had now ratified the 1925 Geneva Protocol and the <gloss
                            target="#t_BW_1">BW</gloss> Convention.</p>
                    <p>6. Many delegations also made it clear that they were awaiting further steps
                        by the co-chairmen with regard to the committee’s deliberations on
                        environmental modification restraints. Virtually all delega<pb n="449"
                            facs="0483" xml:id="pg_449"/>tions seem to feel the need to become
                        better informed about this new area of work and they look toward the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        as the only sources of expertise. These sentiments were reflected in the
                        Swedish delegation’s proposal for an informal meeting on the subject and
                        this has now been scheduled for the summer session. In addition, our allies
                        have made it clear that they feel it would be highly desirable for the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to put forward a draft <gloss
                            target="#t_EnMod_1">EnMod</gloss> convention at the summer session to
                        counter the troublesome and unacceptable text. <gloss target="#t_USDel_1"
                            >USDel</gloss> shares allies’ view.</p>
                    <p>7. Discussion of nuclear arms control issues during the spring session was
                        rather cursory but many Western, non-aligned and Soviet bloc delegations
                        expressed their concerns about the need for strengthening the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> regime. In this connection a number of
                        delegations called for nuclear disarmament measures by the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and the Soviet Union. They reiterated
                        comments expressed last session about the inadequacies of the <gloss
                            target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss> and were only slightly more positive in
                        their comments on the Vladivostok Summit agreements regarding <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> statement at the opening of the spring session, however,
                        probably helped moderate some of the critical views and skepticism of other
                        delegations about these agreements.</p>
                    <p>8. Indian Rep was obliged on several occasions to defend India’s 1974 nuclear
                        test, particularly in connection with a proposal pushed by the Japanese
                        regarding the committee’s discussion of the arms control implications of
                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>. The Indian Delegation’s
                        defensiveness on the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> issue obviously
                        influenced its approach to a number of procedural matters that the committee
                        discussed and led the Indians to engage in diversionary and obstructionist
                        tactics to counter arrangements that they apparently felt might weaken their
                        position at the committee. Ultimately, however, the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1"
                            >CCD</gloss> was able to reach a compromise on scheduling an informal
                        meeting on <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> for the summer.</p>
                    <p>9. Throughout the spring session our working relationship with the Soviet
                        Union Delegation remained good despite the problems posed by the <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> issue cited above. Statements by the Soviets
                        and their allies were restrained as far as treatment of the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> was concerned and our personal contacts
                        with Soviet Bloc diplomats remained friendly and businesslike. Among the
                        Western allies, coordination was reasonably good. The Canadians were helpful
                        and cooperative but as usual were uninhibited about speaking out regarding
                        issues on which they had policy differences with the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> The new <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> Delegate
                        adopted a cautious and cooperative approach. Italians were largely inactive.
                        Dutch were very helpful in setting up <gloss target="#t_NFZ_1">NFZ</gloss>
                        group. The British Delegation, under a new Ambassador, operated rather
                        unsteadily. The Japanese Delegation maintained its free-wheeling style of
                        recent years under Ambassador Nisibori and, as noted above, remained
                        hypersensitive on the <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> issue.</p>

                    <p>10. During the final week of the spring session, the ad hoc group of experts
                        to study nuclear free zones held its first organizational meetings. The
                        selection of participants in this group had involved protracted
                        consultations and negotiations at the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss>
                        and preoccupied the committee’s members during the first half of the spring
                        session. The participation issue was ultimately resolved, however, on a
                        basis that was satisfactory to all members of the committee and the
                        successful launching of the group had a positive effect on the atmosphere at
                        the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> itself. Mindful of existing
                        difficulties and problems in the way of concrete negotiations in other arms
                        control areas, many members of the committee regarded the nuclear free zone
                        study as possibly the most productive endeavor with which the <gloss
                            target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> will be associated during this year.</p>

                    <p>Developments over the past year, in particular the Indian nuclear explosion
                        and the Soviet position that some accommodation be made for <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> in the TTBT have brought a degree of

                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>) issues. In addition to the issues arising
                        in the preparation of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> position for
                        Round III of the TTBT III negotiations, several other principal areas at

                        to other countries?</p>
                    <p>(4) How far should the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> go in developing

                    <p>These issues will arise in the near future during several international

                        stimulation, recovery of oil from oil shale, several storage applications,
                        mining, and electric power production. <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1"
                            >ERDA</gloss> is now considering proposing future work on at least some
                        of these applications. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has no
                        current excavation interest.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union has a continuing program in both contained and excavation
                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> applications. They have stated an
                        interest in eleven <pb n="452" facs="0486" xml:id="pg_452"/>contained <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> applications and have claimed that three
                        contained and one excavation application have been reduced to practice. One
                        of these, (gas condensate storage) has been described fully in public.
                        Further, they have requested that the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>
                        develop health and safety guidelines for <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNEs</gloss>, including excavation projects.</p>
                    <p>France and the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> are studying oil storage,
                        and the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> is financing an Egyptian study
                        for a major hydroelectric project, including nuclear excavation as an
                        option. A number of technical, political and legal (e.g., <gloss
                            target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>) problems remain to be resolved before
                        nuclear excavation projects could be carried out.</p>
                    <p>While <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> and competing advanced
                        technologies are projected in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to
                        have generally similar costs, these estimates are very uncertain. Contained
                        applications, except hydrocarbon storage, would require at least 5–10 years
                        of successful development in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to
                        establish technical suitability for commercial use, with additional time for
                        resolving regulatory issues.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets may be planning to indicate at the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                            >NPT</gloss> Review Conference or in other fora that they have reduced
                        certain <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> applications to practice and
                        are ready and willing to provide <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        service to <gloss target="#t_NNWS_1">NNWS</gloss> parties. If this happened
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> could be asked whether it is also
                        willing to provide such services.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Strategy Options</p>
                    <p>Assuming that a decision is made to adopt an overall strategy, the basic
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> strategy options would be to continue
                        the present approach or adopt either a more positive or more cautious
                        attitude toward: (i) the prospects for <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                        >PNEs</gloss>, (ii) assistance to other countries in <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> studies, and (iii) development of
                        international agreements for <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> services.
                        These strategies interrelate with our non-proliferation policy, and, to a
                        considerably lesser extent, with the TTBT Article III negotiations and
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet competition internationally.
                        Another factor is the level of effort in the domestic <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> program that would be a precondition for
                        each strategy.</p>

                            >PNE</gloss> program.</p>
                    <p>b. Is consistent with present <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> position

                    <p>c. Fails to stop politically motivated criticism of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> for not implementing Article V promptly.</p>

                    <p>b. Could tend to weaken <gloss target="#t_NNWS_1">NNWS</gloss> rationale for

                    <p>c. Would be approach most consistent with the present low-level of funding in
                        the domestic <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> program.</p>
                    <p>d. Would reinforce <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>

                    <p>b. Without similar Soviet stance, effectiveness would be reduced and there

                    <p>c. Could provide more excuse for weapon development under the guise of <gloss

                    <p>b. Would tend to minimize any advantages to the Soviets that might result

                        nuclear devices, because the perception of utility will be greater.</p>
                    <p>b. If the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> were unable or unwilling to

                    <p>c. If the more positive approach were applied to excavation applications, the

                        make it clear that the Conference is merely one of several forums for our

                        accession to the Treaty by non-party states. <hi rend="italic">But there is

                    <p>Our approach to the Conference will be largely defensive, meeting charges by
                        the non-nuclear weapon states that the nuclear powers have undermined the

                        that the nuclear powers have not done enough to:</p>
                    <p>—guarantee adequately the security of non-nuclear states against the threat
                        or use of nuclear weapons;</p>
                    <p>—ensure that international safeguards are not more onerous for <gloss

                        through preferential treatment to <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>

                    <p>—make available the “potential benefits” of peaceful nuclear explosions.</p>
                    <p>Rhetorically, we will meet these objections by emphasizing the progress that
                        has been made since the Treaty went into effect. However, the following
                        specific issues, discussed in more detail in the interagency paper at Tab B,
                        need policy decision in order to determine our position at the
                        Conference.</p>
                    <pb n="456" facs="0490" xml:id="pg_456"/>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Security Assurances.</hi> Several non-nuclear weapon
                        states (<gloss target="#t_NNWS_1">NNWS</gloss>) have already indicated that
                        they will press for assurances by the nuclear powers not to use or threaten
                        to use nuclear weapons against them. The Verification Panel working group,
                        in its paper at Tab D, developed several options, focusing on two
                        alternatives to our present policy of opposing general non-use commitments.
                        The first of these, <hi rend="italic">non-use assurances for parties to
                            nuclear-free-zone arrangements</hi>, does not benefit states because of
                        their <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> status, and thus would not help
                        us in responding to pressures at the Review Conference. While we might
                        consider this policy at some point, there is no sense in considering this as
                        an initiative at the Review Conference.</p>
                    <p>The second alternative, <hi rend="italic">non-use assurances to <gloss
                                target="#t_NNWS_1">NNWS</gloss> party to the <gloss
                                target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> except in response to an armed attack
                            assisted by a nuclear weapons state</hi>, is modeled after Protocol II
                        of the Latin American Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. This option was suggested as
                        a useful way to head off more extreme initiatives at the Review Conference.
                        Supporters argue that it merely rules out something we would never do
                        anyway—namely, the use of nuclear weapons in retaliation to a purely
                        conventional attack by an <gloss target="#t_NNWS_1">NNWS</gloss> acting
                        alone. Thus, it is said to cost nothing in terms of deterrence, while
                        providing an incentive for <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>
                        adherence.</p>
                    <p>In our view, the value of such an assurance is subject to some doubt. It
                        would not be a major influence on the key <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                            >NPT</gloss> holdouts, such as Israel, Egypt, and Pakistan. Furthermore,
                        while the assurance would not rule out nuclear strikes against Pact
                        countries in a Soviet-supported attack on <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss> (or a North Korea attack supported by China), the
                        declaration can nevertheless be expected to inject some uncertainty in the
                        minds of our allies—at a time when we want to make the strongest
                        reaffirmation of our support. Thus, we believe you should move the
                        Verification Panel principals toward a consensus that at this time, we
                        should make no change in our present position of unwillingness to give
                        general non-use commitments.</p>
                    <p>In order to appear somewhat forthcoming at the Conference, we should be able
                        to work with our allies to develop a negative assurance formulation that
                        does not go beyond existing obligations, such as those already assumed under
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Charter.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">International Safeguards.</hi> We can expect complaints
                        by <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> parties that the safeguards they
                        assume under the Treaty are more onerous than those imposed on non-parties
                        by supplier countries as a condition of export. To match the obligation
                        assumed by <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> parties, we would have to
                        require as a condition of supply that non-parties put all of their peaceful
                        nuclear activities under <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards.
                        The French at least will not go along with this. But a consensus is emerging
                        among suppliers that an agreed list of items should be put under <gloss
                            target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards of common duration and scope.
                        It would be fully consistent <pb n="457" facs="0491" xml:id="pg_457"/>with
                        this consensus to announce at the Review Conference, either singly or with
                        other suppliers, that we will give major weight in future nuclear export
                        decision to the comprehensiveness of the safeguards on the recipient’s
                        peaceful nuclear activities.</p>

                    <quote>

                        <p>• We would announce at the Conference that <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                                >NPT</gloss> adherence will be one of several factors given
                            favorable consideration in future <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            decisions on the rates charged by the Export-Import Bank for financing
                            nuclear exports.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>Giving preferences to <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> parties without
                        similar commitments by other suppliers can place the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> at a disadvantage in competing for business from non-party
                        states and might stimulate independent development by non-parties that would
                        increase the risk of proliferation. These two <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1"
                            >ACDA</gloss> proposals probably avoid these difficulties. They allow
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to improve its treatment of <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> parties without imposing any new
                        restrictions in its dealings with non-parties.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, neither proposal is particularly well thought out. Giving
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> parties preference in our bilateral
                        technical assistance programs would have no practical impact because
                        virtually all <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> technical assistance is
                        funnelled through the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>. Implementation
                        of the credit rate preference would require further consultations with the
                        Export/Import Bank and could involve special Congressional legislation.
                        Thus, <hi rend="italic">we believe your best approach would be to point out
                            at the meeting that these initiatives would have to be further developed
                            before they could be aired at the Review Conference.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> has also proposed that these two
                        initiatives be used to discourage nations from acquiring their own chemical
                        reprocessing facilities by giving preference in allocating technical
                        assistance and by giving favorable export credit rates to those states
                        willing to forego reprocessing plants.</p>
                    <p>Reprocessing is undoubtedly a major proliferation problem. Through this
                        process, weapons-usable plutonium is extracted from the spent fuel rods used
                        in power reactors. The process is so expensive that none of the countries
                        trying to obtain a national facility (including Pakistan, Korea, the
                        Republic of China, and Brazil) can justify it on strictly economic
                        grounds—raising some question about their real intentions. Finally, although
                        some safeguards are possible on reprocessing plants, they are very difficult
                        technically; it would not be difficult to divert enough material to make
                        several bombs per year even if a <pb n="458" facs="0492" xml:id="pg_458"
                        />plant were under international safeguards. For these reasons, we have
                        tried to discourage acquisition of national facilities in our bilateral
                        discussions with these countries and have made a major effort among the
                        nuclear suppliers to get agreement on a multinational approach to
                        reprocessing plants.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Nonetheless, it probably does not make sense to discuss
                            reprocessing at the Review Conference. The suppliers meeting is a better
                            forum for dealing with the issue.</hi> The <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                            >NPT</gloss> does not discuss specific processes such as reprocessing,

                        avoid its Article IV obligation to share nuclear technology.</p>
                    <p>At the Review Conference we should probably content ourselves with seeking
                        support for an expedited international study of this subject, urging states
                        contemplating the purchase of these facilities to hold off on their
                        decisions until the results of the study are available. This will give us

                    <p>The guidance on this point is well established; we must successfully complete

                        follow-on negotiations aimed at reductions. You will want to emphasize at
                        the Verification Panel meeting that this is the extent of the commitment we

                        indicated that they will attend.</p>
                    <p>In preparing for this meeting, we have discussed in a series of bilaterals
                        our views in five areas of nuclear control:</p>

                    </quote>
                    <p>We have supplied to the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> the paper at Tab I
                        which summarizes our views on the above points and, without attribution,
                        gives the views of other suppliers. It is our expectation that this summary
                        will be the basis for substantive discussions at the exploratory meeting,
                        and the starting point for the other countries in developing positions for
                        the Conference itself. The rest of the discussions in London will center on
                        procedural questions, and our delegation will be guided by the instructions
                        at Tab H.</p>
                    <p>Our main purpose at the London meeting will be to edge the suppliers closer
                        to a full-fledged conference in June and July, at which we hope to reach
                        common understandings on supply policies. At next week’s meeting we want to
                        review the assorted national positions, but without seeking any commitments,
                        so as not to scare anyone away. This point needs to be emphasized at the
                        Verification Panel meeting.</p>
                    <p>The most sensitive issue involves provision of chemical reprocessing
                        facilities to <gloss target="#t_NNWS_1">NNWS</gloss>. France and the <gloss
                            target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> are about to conclude deals to provide
                        reprocessing facilities to South Korea and Brazil respectively. Because such
                        plants produce quantities of weapon-usable material and are difficult to
                        safeguard effectively, there is risk of diversion of bomb material. These
                        plants—though they will have <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>
                        safeguards—have generated considerable controversy. <gloss
                            target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> and some bureaus in State want us to
                        intervene strongly to halt the sales. Neither France nor the <gloss
                            target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> is likely to reverse itself, but we may be
                        able to obtain a concession <pb n="461" facs="0495" xml:id="pg_461"/>of
                        multinational ownership which would be added deterrence against
                        diversion.</p>
                    <p>Our policy has been to seek multinational reprocessing plants as a hedge
                        against diversion. To badger others on the basic issue of selling
                        reprocessing facilities runs the risk of jeopardizing common understandings.
                        The Verification Panel principals need to understand this.</p>
                    <p>One other argument against reprocessing facilities in <gloss
                            target="#t_NNWS_1">NNWS</gloss> is that they are not economical. The
                        other suppliers may see that argument as an attempt to preempt their
                        commercial opportunities. In discussing the reprocessing issue, it should be
                        predominantly on proliferation grounds, not economic. We can, however,
                        support and even accelerate the international study of the need for and
                        economic aspects of reprocessing now underway in the <gloss

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We have to have
                        a <gloss target="#t_WSAG_1">WSAG</gloss> right after this meeting, so we had
                        better get moving. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Fred</persName> (Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>) would you give us a
                        run-down on how you view the upcoming Review Conference?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: We view the Review
                        Conference as an opportunity to reaffirm our committment to the
                        Non-Proliferation Treaty and to promote accession to the Treaty by non-party
                        states. We do not plan to address any new problems. We hope to keep it
                        strictly to a reaffirmation of the Treaty. We believe we will come under
                        attack on two things: (1) that we have not done enough to guarantee
                        adequately the security of non-nuclear states against the threat or use of
                        nuclear weapons; and (2) that we have not been forthcoming enough on
                        technical assistance.</p>
                    <pb n="463" facs="0497" xml:id="pg_463"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me make one
                        point. We are going to stand on our record at this Conference and at any
                        other conferences. The United States is not going to any international
                        conference with a defeatist attitude. We’re going there as a world power.
                        We’ll negotiate in good faith, but I want to make it clear to everybody that
                        the United States is too tough to be pushed around. I don’t want any of this
                        masochistic self-criticism in which we so often specialize.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: You’re stealing my
                        thunder.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Thunder
                        away!</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: I think I can dispense with
                        the technical issues very quickly. We expect the less developed countries to
                        attack us on our record of assistance to them in the nuclear field. They
                        will argue that considerably more assistance has gone to non-parties to the
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> than to parties to the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Who will attack
                        us, India?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: India won’t be there. I’m
                        thinking of Mexico and some of the other Latin American countries.</p>
                    <p>We think that there are two difficult issues we will face. The first is
                        negative security assurances (or non-use assurances). This is the question
                        of whether nuclear weapons states will give assurances that they will not
                        use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What is the
                        negative security issue?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Well, it boils down to
                        whether nuclear weapons states are prepared to say that they will not use
                        nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states (<gloss target="#t_NNWS_1"
                            >NNWS</gloss>). We think that a flat “no” would be awkward. We have
                        looked at various options in the working group.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Are you saying
                        that the nuclear weapons states are prepared to renounce use of nuclear
                        weapons against non-nuclear weapon states?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: We are saying that we will
                        not use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapons states. There are
                        contingencies to that. The Defense Department prefers not to get into this
                        issue right now and to avoid any change in present policy.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What does the
                        State Department prefer?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sonnenfeldt: Absolutely no change. We support <gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                            >DOD</gloss> in that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Well, there is an implied
                        difference. There are at least two choices of how to make a non-use
                        assurance.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What do you
                        mean, two choices? We either will use nuclear weapons or refuse to use
                        nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: The first choice is that we
                        refuse—that we agree not to use nuclear weapons against non-weapons states.
                        The second choice is to make this assurance with an exception for
                        non-nuclear states in alliance with the nuclear powers.</p>

                            target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> is against this?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: We don’t think that
                        this is a good time to change our position.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: And State is
                        against this?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sonnenfeldt: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Your
                        understanding is that we will have to handle criticism on this point.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: We will be having further
                        discussions with the allies on this. We could publish a statement. I think
                        that our best ploy is to leave it open in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss>. We could use part of the Japanese text that talks about
                        avoiding the use of force generally in relations between states.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What’s that?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: That the Japanese have our
                        support for this text. (Hands the Secretary a copy of the Japanese
                        text).</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sonnenfeldt: I can’t say that this moves the thing very far.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What other
                        issues are there?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Technical assistance, we
                        think, will probably be brought up. We think that something can be done in
                        that field. One thing we could do, for example, is give preferential
                        treatment in terms of credits to parties to the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                            >NPT</gloss>. One percentage point, for example. Congress will probably
                        want some type of legislation to back that up, however. We could say at the
                        Review Conference that we will seek congressional agreement for preferential
                        treatment toward <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> parties.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Will
                        reprocessing come up or be handled only in the suppliers context?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Reprocessing (where,
                        weapons-usable plutonium is extracted from the spent fuel rods used in power
                        reactors) may come up. We think that our best tack would be to be supportive
                        of that (the approach in the suppliers’ context).</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: On the point of
                        assurances. I have not raised that subject with the President. The
                        President, however, is not about to change any commitment of any kind at
                        this time. There will be no redeployment of weapons without his specific
                        approval. I do not want any discussion of this issue. The President asked me
                        to make this clear at the first opportunity in an interagency forum, so
                        don’t get case-by-case on this. This position suggests that we cannot give
                        non-use assurances.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Maybe we can go along with
                        the Japanese text.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sonnenfeldt: No. I think it focuses too much on nuclear weapon
                        states.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: This is a left-handed
                        blow to the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> Conference. The implication
                        is that we are trying to do away with special treatment for <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> parties.</p>
                    <pb n="465" facs="0499" xml:id="pg_465"/>
                    <p>Mr. Sonnenfeldt: This is crazy.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It says here
                        (reads from Japanese text). The implication is that it must be nuclear
                        weapons.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: The Japanese text
                        might be modified.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, let’s all
                        analyze it. Our basic policy is not to give that type of assurance. In the
                        wake of Indochina, we do not want to give the impression of backing down
                        anywhere.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Our allies want to make a
                        general offer of our assurance to countries not tied to alliances.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Is India going
                        to be there?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: No, India will not be
                        there.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sonnenfeldt: The Swedes, for one, want us to do that.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: And the African
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: So, we’re clear
                        on the security assurances.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Right.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We’ll let
                            <persName corresp="#p_SBA_1">Brent</persName> (Gen. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SBA_1">Scowcroft</persName>) work it out with Defense and
                        let you know whether we can accept the Japanese language. We’ll do it in the
                        working group. There is still time. On Monday you can discuss it in the
                        working group.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: I would like to pursue the
                        question of giving credit rate preference to favorable countries through the
                        Export-Import Bank, if I could. (Export-Import Bank President) <persName
                            corresp="#p_CW_1">Casey</persName> is in favor of it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sonnenfeldt: How much money are you talking about, $100,000?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: No, it would be much more
                        than that.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: Yes, but that would
                        involve going to Congress.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Yes, I know, but I believe
                        we could win this one.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Requiring
                        congressional approval is the best negative assurance I know of!</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sonnenfeldt: Another angle would be that whichever country is authorized
                        Ex-Im bank credits they not be discriminatory and not be used against an
                        ally who is not a party to the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> versus a
                        non-ally and a member of the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Spain is one, for
                        example.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sonnenfeldt: That’s one that I had in mind.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: I think we can be flexible
                        enough to handle that problem.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I see no problem
                        with that. Are there any others?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Those are the essential
                        ones.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Okay. There are
                        a number of other issues. <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>? Are we all
                        agreed on the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> issue?</p>
                    <pb n="466" facs="0500" xml:id="pg_466"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: No, <gloss
                            target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss> has some problems. They would like to
                        use the Review Conference to gain some leverage on the <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> issue in the Threshhold Test Ban Treaty
                            (<gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss>) talks and in the <gloss
                            target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SRC_1">Seamans</persName>: Well, we are in general
                        agreement with everybody on the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> issue.
                        We do think, however, that we ought to have a stand-by position at the
                        Review Conference and see if we can exploit it.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I have no
                        disagreement with that. The Nuclear Proliferation Treaty obligates us to
                        share our nuclear conclusions with member states. As I understand it, the
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> says that only the level of
                        programs must be shared with the other countries. It doesn’t obligate us to
                        give more than we know.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SRC_1">Seamans</persName>: All it says is that it
                        must be at some modest level.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’m in favor of
                        saying at the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> that we will stick to our
                        modest program.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Yeah, we’ll just repeat our
                        long-standing language. In the <gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss>, we’re
                        already working with the Soviets on an agreement governing <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Okay, are there
                        any other problems?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: No, not really.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: There are some other
                        problems that might come up outside the Review Conference—like the Iranian
                        nuclear deal.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Okay, who will
                        be doing the talking at the Suppliers Conference?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">Vest</persName>: You have already talked to
                        the French about that. The French expect to hear from them, so everyone will
                        be there—seven in all. I think it will be strictly experimental and that it
                        will not go far in substance. The Japanese and the Germans are cautious. We
                        expect to get a common level of understanding by June or July.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Will the Soviets
                        be there?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">Vest</persName>: Yes. The British have taken
                        on the task of running the show.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Are you going to
                        go? (to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: No, I won’t be there. We
                        are sending only a very small team. There are two things, however, we think
                        will come up: the German deal with Brazil, and our deal with Iran. The
                        Germans are insistent upon setting up some sort of deal with Brazil. It is
                        likely that Iran will also come up.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sonnenfeldt: We have a fairly tough policy point with respect to the
                        Iranians. Our priorities are about to clash. The Iranians will argue their
                        principal economic concern—benefits from access to nuclear power—against
                        whatever it does to nonproliferation.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, if we
                        don’t sell it to them, the French will.</p>
                    <pb n="467" facs="0501" xml:id="pg_467"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: What if the Shah decides to
                        get it from Europe?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: There is 100% support
                        in Congress for an agreement with controls.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Suppose the
                        agreement says never to have national reprocessing?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: That’s a subject of
                        further study.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What is the
                        ideal position?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Multilateral
                        reprocessing.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But that’s pure
                        ideology.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: What do you think about the
                        chance of bilateral processing?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I think a 50–50
                        chance would be realistic.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Then there is not much left
                        in the Suppliers Conference. Also, Congress will object.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sonnenfeldt: That’s the question we need to decide.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, we might
                        just as well stand for what we believe is right and let Congress take the
                        blame.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: The Defense Department
                        feels that we should try the multilateral approach to reprocessing.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: And the French . . .</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If we get every
                        one of the suppliers to agree, I see no problem. I don’t expect that will be
                        possible, however. If not, maybe then we let the Iranian deal go forward. We
                        can stall the Iranians until we find out if we can get a multilateral
                        agreement. On the whole, I would prefer not to have national reprocessing
                        plants. I feel that the question is if we cannot get an agreement to that,
                        should the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> then refuse to sell nuclear
                        reactors to countries with reprocessing plants?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: I hope that we are not
                        at that point yet.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I know.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Another point regarding
                        reprocessing is not to urge a 10 year duration.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The Iran
                        negotiations should be confined to what we need to decide now. It ought to
                        be handled first at the Suppliers Conference—get a full picture of the
                        prospects for multilateral reprocessing.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sonnenfeldt: The <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> involves
                        instructions on how to deal with this problem.</p>

                    <p>The President has reviewed the study directed by <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1"
                            >NSSM</gloss> 219 and has noted the comments and recommendations of the
                        agencies. The President has decided that in negotiating an Agreement on
                        Cooperation in the Civil Uses of Atomic Energy with the Government of Iran,
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> shall:</p>
                    <p>—Permit <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> material to be fabricated into
                        fuel in Iran for use in its own reactors and for pass-through to third
                        countries with whom we have Agreements.</p>
                    <p>—Agree to set the fuel ceiling at a level reflecting the approximate number
                        of nuclear reactors planned for purchase from <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> suppliers. We would, as a fallback, be prepared to
                        increase the ceiling to cover Iran’s full nuclear requirement under the
                        proviso that the fuel represents Iran’s entitlement from their proposed

                            >U.S.</gloss> Any additional entitlement could be disposed of by Iran

                        Cooperation.</p>
                    <p>—Continue to require <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> approval for
                        reprocessing of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> supplied fuel, while
                        indicating that the establishment of a multinational reprocessing plant
                        would be an important factor favoring such approval. As a fallback, we could

                        in a multinational plant in Iran if the country supplying the reprocessing

                    <p>As you recall, following last summer’s debacle wherein the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> had to abort some and discontinue other
                        foreign contracts for enriched uranium to fuel nuclear reactors, the
                        President approved a <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> to look at the
                        fundamental question of how the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> will
                        carry out President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>’s
                        commitment to be a reliable supplier of nuclear fuel to the free world.</p>
                    <p>The basic pending decision is whether the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> Government will undertake to build additional enrichment
                        facilities or will we continue to <hi rend="italic">wait</hi> for a private
                        company to take on this responsibility. There is one company (<gloss
                            target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss>) which has evinced interest in getting
                        into this business, but, thus far in the year of negotiations, it has not
                        been able to line up customers to make the venture look viable. <gloss
                            target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss> is now asking for a variety of government
                        supports to make its private entry feasible.</p>
                    <pb n="470" facs="0504" xml:id="pg_470"/>
                    <p>In the meantime, our international position as a supplier of nuclear fuel is
                        badly eroding. Some examples are: The Brazilians are just concluding a
                        multibillion dollar nuclear deal with the Germans because they no longer
                        view us as a reliable nuclear partner. The British have canceled enrichment
                        contracts with us and placed them with the Russians. France has made a major
                        entry into the international enrichment market by starting construction of a
                        large enrichment plant and may be on the verge of a commitment to a second
                        plant.</p>
                    <p>We have tried over several months to move the decision to the President as to
                        whether or not the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> can afford to
                        persevere in its attempt to establish private uranium enrichment in the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> if the transition cost is going to
                        be so great in foreign policy and foreign trade. But we have been held up
                        because <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1"
                            >ERDA</gloss> have, at one time or another, urged delay while the <gloss
                            target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss> deal is further examined.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss> has now concluded that the <gloss
                            target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss> deal is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> worthy
                        of support and proposes that the government commit to build a new plant. We
                        would, at the same time, start taking enrichment contracts (domestic and
                        foreign) again.</p>
                    <p>I understand that <persName corresp="#p_LJT_1">Lynn</persName> has asked you
                        to agree to continue the delay in putting the fundamental question to the

                            target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss> could take months. (The truth of the
                        matter is that the <gloss target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss> deal would, in any
                        event, have to be so propped up with government support and money that we

                        <persName corresp="#p_LJT_1">Lynn</persName> makes no mention in his

                    <p>Your options are to press for presentation of this issue to the President
                        now, or to delay further (possibly some months) to see if the <gloss

                    </list>
                    <p>With the next round of the TTB/PNE negotiations now scheduled to begin June 3
                        and the interagency work nearing completion, I want to convey to you my
                        assessment of the critical choice that is involved.</p>
                    <p>We still face the main stumbling block from the 1974 summit that prevented us
                        from completing the threshold test ban treaty in the first place, namely the
                        claimed Soviet interest in excavation explosions with individual yields
                        above the 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> threshold. In line with
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>’s commitment to
                        follow-on negotiations on this problem, the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss> devised a set of limitations (primarily a limit on fission
                        yield) and corresponding verification requirements to apply to individual
                        excavation explosions larger than 150 kilotons, and these have been under
                        active discussion with the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>Cutting through the forest of detail, I see two possible outcomes for
                        agreement:</p>
                    <p>Outcome 1. <hi rend="italic">Soviet Acceptance of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> Conditions on Excavation PNEs</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>If all of our proposed limitations and verification arrangements for large
                        excavation explosives are accepted by the Soviets, we would have placed
                        significant short-term limitations, but not definitive limitations, on the
                        potential for weapon testing through <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>.
                        We still need to reach agreement with the Soviets on important details in
                        our position <pb n="472" facs="0506" xml:id="pg_472"/>on verification
                        modalities: in particular, (1) on collection of “melt samples” at excavation
                        sites, and (2) on verification of geometry and dimensions of any cavities
                        beneath emplacements of explosive devices which could strongly affect or
                        prevent measurement of fission yield. The Soviets have so far been negative
                        toward such provisions.</p>
                    <p>Outcome 2. <hi rend="italic">Soviet Acceptance of a 150 Kiloton Limit on
                            Individual <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> In Exchange for <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Concessions on Salvo Yield and
                            Verification Provisions</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Alternatively, we could respond to Soviet reluctance to accept our required
                        verification measures by offering the following modified terms for a
                        simplified <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> agreement (that would be
                        consistent with our 1974 summit commitment):</p>
                    <p>(1) Limit the yield of individual excavation explosives to 150 kilotons. (A
                        Soviet concession.)</p>
                    <p>(2) Permit distinguishable salvo explosions to have a high aggregate yield,
                        up to 500 kilotons or even 1 megaton. (A <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> concession.)</p>
                    <p>(3) Remove the fission yield limitation and, hence, the requirement for
                        collection of melt samples. (A <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        concession.)</p>
                    <p>(4) Trim down verification provisions to those necessary to establish the
                        fact that the yield of any individual explosion does not exceed 150
                        kilotons. (A <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> concession.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Outcome 2</hi> would handle <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNEs</gloss> in a manner readily understandable to all audiences,
                        including the Senate. It would not involve the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> with provisions or observations which could prejudice our
                        position on the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>, or on the
                        separability of <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> from weapons. It would
                        provide an explanation of why the threshold was set at 150 <gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>—a level considerably higher than the <hi
                            rend="italic">current</hi> limit of our detection capability.</p>
                    <p>Yet, <hi rend="italic">Outcome 2</hi> would also give the Soviets the freedom
                        to carry out large-scale <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> projects
                        through salvo explosions. It would meet our commitment to negotiate special
                        provisions for <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> by permitting them to
                        exceed the threshold in salvos and by permitting them to be detonated
                        outside of test sites.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Outcome 1</hi>, on the other hand, would leave us with an
                        agreement that would still have significant liabilities, even if the Soviets
                        accepted all the provisions critical to verifying restraints on weapons
                        testing through PNEs:</p>
                    <p>—We would have signed an agreement making explicit provisions for <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> observation of radioactivity from
                        excavation <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>, an activity which is
                        likely to be associated with a violation of the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> interpretation of the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1"
                            >LTBT</gloss>. We would face the possibility of being placed in the
                        position of participating in an event which we consider a violation of one
                        agreement in order to verify compliance with another one.</p>
                    <p>—We would have given legal status to a technological distinction between
                        excavation <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> and advanced weapons tests.
                        While we can <pb n="473" facs="0507" xml:id="pg_473"/>insist on the validity
                        of this distinction for countries which long tested nuclear weapons, third
                        countries will, nevertheless, use this to support assertions that <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> can indeed be distinguished from nuclear
                        weapons.</p>
                    <p>—We will have lost the possibility of using <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNEs</gloss> as part of the explanation for setting the threshold on
                        weapons tests at 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>, considerably higher
                        than the verifiable limit.</p>
                    <p>—If the weapon test threshold were lowered in the future (Soviet and <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> domestic pressures might move us in that
                        direction) the separate limitation on <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>
                        could become an increasingly troublesome loophole for Soviet tests of
                        military significance that would be unavailable to the United States.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusion</p>
                    <p>On balance, <hi rend="italic">Outcome 2</hi> seems clearly preferable to <hi
                            rend="italic">Outcome 1.</hi> If we stick fast to our verification
                        requirements, it seems reasonable to expect that Outcome 2 would also be
                        preferable to the Russians, since it would minimize involvement of <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> observers in their <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> shots and avoid any risk that we would
                        secure useful information about the design of their devices as a by-product
                        of verification.</p>
                    <p>Thus, we should make all our concessions towards Outcome 2. We should make no
                        concessions on verification modalities for <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNEs</gloss> above 150 kilotons which would not only steer the Soviets
                        toward Outcome 1 but would actually compound its liabilities by raising
                        doubts about our ability to verify compliance with the agreement.</p>

                        conference organizational matters. Only controversial note was Nigerian
                        challenge of immediate approval of South African request for observer
                        status. Conference President ruled that question be deferred for
                        consideration by General Committee. General debate begins Tuesday, May 7.

                    <p>2. Waldheim, in opening address to conference, called for full implementation
                        of <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>’s provisions and adherence to it by
                        countries that have not yet become parties. He noted importance of promoting
                        peaceful uses of nuclear energy with special regard to needs of developing
                        countries, but gave particular emphasis to inter-relationship between
                        objectives of preventing spread of nuclear weapons and curbing nuclear arms
                        race. He said in this regard that implementation of <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                            >NPT</gloss>’s provisions dealing with nuclear disarmament would have
                        most important consequences for future. Citing Security Council Resolution
                        255, Waldheim said that <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> has played
                        important role in providing security guarantees to non-nuclear weapon
                        states, and indicated that <gloss target="#t_Revcon_1">Revcon</gloss> would
                        have opportunity to discuss this question further.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_EAS_1">Eklund</persName> gave brief remarks on role
                        of nuclear power in meeting worldwide energy demands, but stressed
                        importance of research reactors as possible sources of weapons-grade nuclear
                        materials. We understand he will make longer statement later in week.</p>
                    <p>4. As prearranged, Mrs <persName corresp="#p_TI_1">Thorsson</persName>
                        (Sweden) was elected President of Conference by acclamation; Ambs <persName

                        Conference.</p>
                    <p>5. Conference formally adopted rules of procedure that had been finalized in
                        Preparatory Committee meetings in February. Only amendment to rules was
                        increase in number of Vice Presidencies (from 24 to 26) to give effect to
                        informal understanding at <gloss target="#t_Prepcom_1">Prepcom</gloss> that
                        Euratom countries, should they become parties prior to <gloss
                            target="#t_Revcon_1">Revcon</gloss> opening, would be granted two
                        additional <gloss target="#t_VP_1">VPs</gloss>. Western Vice Presidents are
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UK_1"
                            >UK</gloss> (as depositary powers) and Australia, Ireland, Denmark,
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>, and the Netherlands (as members of
                        WEO Western European and others— regional group). Mongolia was elected
                            <gloss target="#t_VP_1">VP</gloss> from Asian group. We were told that
                            <persName corresp="#p_GRA_1">Garcia Robles</persName> (Mexico) had
                        protested Mongolian designation as Asian group member, rather than as
                        Eastern group member, but had been overruled by other members of non-aligned
                        group.</p>
                    <p>6. There had been indications earlier in day that non-aligned would insist,
                        contrary to “gentleman’s agreement” at <gloss target="#t_Prepcom_1"
                            >Prepcom</gloss>, that their group be given two additional <gloss
                            target="#t_VP_1">VPs</gloss> to compensate for Euratom. They did not,
                        however, press matter in plenary. (There was speculation that “Group of 77,”
                        which is represented by fewer delegations at <gloss target="#t_Revcon_1"
                            >Revcon</gloss> than expected, was having difficulty finding additional
                        delegations willing to serve as <gloss target="#t_VP_1">VPs</gloss>.)</p>
                    <p>7. Conference next turned to question of observers. Noting rule of procedure
                        that states that have neither signed nor ratified <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                            >NPT</gloss> may apply for observer status and be accorded that status
                        on decision of conference, <persName corresp="#p_TI_1">Thorsson</persName>
                        indicated that Algeria, Cuba, Israel, and South Africa had asked to be
                        seated as observers. <persName corresp="#p_CBA_1">Clark</persName> (Nigeria)
                        took floor to request that conference decisions on applications for observer
                        status be postponed until credentials of some applicants (mentioning only
                        South Africa by name) could be examined by Credentials Committee. <persName
                            corresp="#p_TI_1">Thorsson</persName> stated that granting of observer
                        status and establishing credentials of conference participants (i.e.,
                        parties and signatories) were two different matters, but, after
                        interventions by Sudan and Zaire in support of Nigerian position, agreed to
                        take up matter in General Committee.</p>
                    <p>8. At brief meeting of General Committee following plenary session conference
                        agenda and work program were adopted. <persName corresp="#p_CBA_1"
                            >Clark</persName> (Nigeria) again raised question of application of
                        South Africa and others for observer status, suggesting it would be useful
                        if chairman sought advice of the Secretariat on the possibility of
                        submitting the question to the Credentials Committee and asking that matter
                        not be brought to a head too quickly. <persName corresp="#p_GRA_1">Garcia
                            Robles</persName> noted that, since the states in question were in fact
                        present at the conference, a decision to approve their observer status would
                        not be required unless and until they attempted to submit documents, which
                        is the only other right they have. He <pb n="476" facs="0510"
                            xml:id="pg_476"/>therefore thought no harm would be done in waiting two
                        or three days before facing issue. The Rep of Zaire suggested that each
                        application be considered separately on its own merits, and wondered whether
                        South Africa could not simply attend conference on same basis as general
                        public. <persName corresp="#p_TI_1">Thorsson</persName> continued to express
                        doubts that issue was a credentials question, but indicated that more time
                        was needed before decision could be taken.</p>
                    <p>9. It has been rumored that Israel’s observer status may also be challenged.
                        Egyptian <gloss target="#t_DelOff_1">DelOff</gloss> told us that his del
                        appreciates possible adverse repercussions if Israeli application not
                        accepted. SovDel shares Egyptian view that turning away Israel would be a
                        mistake, but thinks that other Arab dels may be more inclined to press
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>10. We have had indications that consensus may be developing in African group
                        not to press matter to a decision. Countries in question would simply
                        continue to observe conference without formal decision being made to accord
                        them observer status. South African and Israeli <gloss target="#t_DelOff_1"
                            >DelOffs</gloss> both informed us they have no intention to submit
                        documents to conference participants. If necessary, we will make arguments
                        outlined in paras 3 and 4 of State 103269 and will further explore the
                        procedures suggested in para 5 of that message. We would also take position
                        that there is no need to examine credentials of observers since they are not
                        conference participants.</p>

                        Treaty at Review Conference</p>
                    <p>It is my privilege to convey a message to this conference from the President
                        of the United States:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>This Review Conference offers an opportunity to focus new attention on
                            our vital obligation to arrest the spread of nuclear weapons. It is a
                            responsibility that confronts all nations equally and impartially.
                            Nuclear energy can and should promote the fortunes of nations assembled
                            at this conference. But its destructive potential can and must be
                            contained.</p>
                        <p>Support for the Nonproliferation Treaty is a major tenet of American
                            policy. Consequently, I hope this conference will:</p>
                        <p>—Convey the importance of nonproliferation to the security of all
                            nations, hence to global stability;</p>
                        <p>—Promote international cooperation in peaceful uses of nuclear energy,
                            while insuring that it not be misused as a means of mass
                            destruction;</p>
                        <p>—Encourage the further development and wider application of effective
                            safeguards and physical security measures for nuclear materials and
                            facilities; and</p>
                        <p>—Review the considerable progress that has been made in arms control and
                            disarmament since the treaty was signed, and promote efforts to build on
                            what has been achieved.</p>
                        <p>We welcome the important recent additions to the roster of parties to the
                            Nonproliferation Treaty, as well as the indications that others are
                            moving toward adherence. We recognize that the treaty’s promise is not
                            yet fully realized, but we take satisfaction from what has been
                            achieved. We further recognize that no treaty by itself can prevent the
                            proliferation of nuclear weapons. Yet we remain convinced that the
                            Nonproliferation Treaty is an essential means of advancing this
                            purpose.</p>
                        <p>Although we still have a long way to go, we see in reviewing the record
                            that the cooperative undertaking to create a more stable world community
                            is well underway.</p>

                        <p>I take this occasion therefore to rededicate the United States to the
                            support of the Nonproliferation Treaty and to the high purpose of a
                            stable peace which animates it.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>Few international endeavors are more deserving of our attention and energy
                        than containing the destructive potential of the atom. The stakes involved
                        are enormous.</p>
                    <p>We cannot be complacent—and indeed we are not—about the nuclear arsenals that
                        now exist. We must press ahead to make more comprehensive the limitations
                        which have been imposed and begin to reduce the potential for destruction, a
                        potential that we can scarcely grasp.</p>
                    <p>But it would be a fatal error if we assumed that we could move forward in
                        reducing the threat of nuclear destruction while nation after nation began
                        to build its own nuclear arsenals. We cannot move forward and backward at
                        the same time. The risk of nuclear destruction—by design, miscalculation, or
                        accident—cannot be reduced if nuclear competition drives a dangerous wedge
                        between neighboring nations throughout the world.</p>
                    <p>Let there be no mistake. The dangers resulting from nuclear proliferation are
                        shared by all, nuclear powers and non-nuclear-weapon states alike.</p>
                    <p>We therefore have a common interest in the success of the Nonproliferation
                        Treaty. It is my government’s hope that this conference will focus attention
                        on the treaty’s essential role in promoting the security of all states and
                        that it will provide a stimulus for cooperative international effort to make
                        the treaty as effective and universally applicable as possible.</p>
                    <p>The basic provisions of the treaty, articles I and II, have been followed
                        faithfully by the parties. The safeguards resulting from article III make an
                        important additional contribution to the security of all states.</p>
                    <p>But in our judgment, the effectiveness of all three articles can be
                        strengthened best by securing the widest possible adherence to the treaty.
                        Hence, it is most gratifying that several states have recently completed
                        their ratification. The Republic of Korea ratified the treaty. Just last
                        week major industrial countries of Western Europe also became parties to the
                        treaty: Belgium, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the
                        Netherlands.</p>
                    <p>We welcome all the new parties. Several of them have attained world
                        leadership in peaceful applications of nuclear technology. This offers
                        telling evidence that the treaty is consistent with progress in the peaceful
                        uses of the atom. In fact, the treaty not only supports peaceful uses but
                        helps preserve the world order without which peaceful uses could not survive
                        and expand.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The First Five Years of the Treaty</p>
                    <p>In its first five years, the treaty has clearly served to increase the volume
                        of international nuclear commerce. The United States, for example, has
                        entered into international arrangements for the enrichment of uranium to
                        meet the needs of some 150 power reactors in non-nuclear-weapon states,
                        having a total capacity of about 120,000 megawatts. In addition, the United
                        States has exported 35 nuclear reactors since 1970. Most of this cooperation
                        has been with states now party to the Nonproliferation Treaty or with
                        signatories whose ratification appears imminent.</p>
                    <p>The United States has shared its peaceful nuclear technology generously. It
                        has provided information, offered training, supported research programs,
                        supplied uranium enrichment services, and sold or donated research and power
                        reactors embodying the most advanced technology.</p>
                    <p>Aid to the developing countries has also increased considerably since the
                        treaty was opened for signature. We believe the developing countries party
                        to the treaty should be given favored consideration in nuclear assistance.
                        Last year, my government announced that parties will be given preference in
                        the allocation of our in-kind contributions to the technical assistance
                        program of the International Atomic Energy Agency. At the same time, we are
                        increasing substantially the amount of our voluntary contribution for
                        1975.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Safeguards Over Peaceful Uses</p>
                    <p>A major purpose—indeed, a major accomplishment—of the Nonproliferation Treaty
                        is to make possible the expansion of peaceful nuclear cooperation. But, as
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> stated to the
                        United Nations last fall [Sept. 23, 1974], our policy of widely supplying
                        nuclear fuels and other nuclear materials “cannot continue if it leads to
                        the proliferation of nuclear explosives.”</p>
                    <p>The rapid expansion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy has raised massive
                        new problems. One is meeting fuel-reprocessing needs in the safest and most
                        economic way. Another is the disposal of the rapidly accumulating nuclear
                        wastes. Fortunately, we still have some time to work out solutions. There is
                        no economic need for reprocessing for several years to come, and spent fuel
                        can still be kept in temporary storage. But nations must cooperate to solve
                        these problems soon to protect the health and safety of all the people.</p>
                    <p>The promotion of peaceful uses of the atom is inseparably linked with
                        safeguards to inspire international confidence that fissionable materials
                        are not being diverted to destructive purposes. We can all take pride in
                        what has been done about safeguards. Specifically, the International Atomic
                        Energy Agency has accomplished a great deal. Its efforts deserve the
                        wholehearted support of us all.</p>
                    <pb n="480" facs="0514" xml:id="pg_480"/>
                    <p>Virtually every party to this treaty with nuclear facilities requiring
                        safeguards has negotiated an agreement with the Agency; and almost every
                        nuclear facility now operating in the non-nuclear-weapon states is subject
                        to Agency safeguards or will be in the near future. This is a good
                        record.</p>
                    <p>But much remains to be done. We need to insure:</p>
                    <p>—That all parties to the treaty conclude agreements with the Agency;</p>
                    <p>—That safeguards are effective and efficient; and</p>
                    <p>—That safeguards cover, as comprehensively as possible, the nuclear
                        facilities of non-nuclear-weapon states not party to the treaty and preclude
                        diversion of nuclear materials for any nuclear explosive device.</p>
                    <p>Also, we have to concern ourselves seriously with the threat of theft and
                        other criminal seizure of nuclear material. We hope this conference will
                        recognize the need for international measures to deal with this grim
                        danger.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Peaceful Nuclear Explosions</p>
                    <p>Article V, as we all know, was included in the treaty to insure that the
                        non-nuclear-weapon states adhering to the treaty would not be deprived of
                        any potential benefits of peaceful nuclear explosions that might be realized
                        by the nuclear-weapon states.</p>
                    <p>In the United States, there has been much research and experimentation on the
                        use of nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes. But we have not yet reduced
                        any application to practice, nor have we obtained any commercial benefits
                        from this technology. If and when we should succeed in doing so, we would of
                        course make those benefits available as called for in the treaty.</p>
                    <p>Questions remain to be resolved regarding the feasibility and practicability
                        of peaceful nuclear explosions. Moreover, no request for such explosions has
                        ever gone beyond the stage of preliminary feasibility studies. For these
                        reasons, there has so far been no practical necessity to conclude the
                        international agreement or agreements mentioned in article V. However, the
                        United States stands ready to negotiate the requisite agreements when the
                        practical need develops.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime, the United States is prepared to participate in
                        consideration of the institutional arrangements that may be required to make
                        the benefits of peaceful nuclear explosions available internationally.
                        Toward this end, important steps have already been taken within the
                        framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency. My government, as one
                        of the potential suppliers of such services, has agreed to assist the Agency
                        in a study of the related legal problems.</p>

                        <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet Arms Control Agreements</p>
                    <p>When this treaty was opened for signature in 1968, the only other postwar
                        arms control agreements were the Antarctic Treaty, the “Hotline” Agreement,
                        the Limited Test Ban Treaty, and the Outer Space Treaty. While these were
                        solid accomplishments, they did not reduce the levels of existing nuclear
                        armaments.</p>
                    <p>At the signing ceremony of the Nonproliferation Treaty, my government and the
                        Soviet Government announced that we would open negotiations to limit
                        offensive and defensive strategic arms. The relationship between the treaty
                        and this announcement was clear: the successful negotiation of this treaty
                        had strengthened mutual confidence between the two largest nuclear-weapon
                        powers and promised to keep nuclear arms control from becoming totally
                        unmanageable.</p>
                    <p>Since then, serious and intensive negotiations on strategic arms limitations
                        have continued steadily and received personal attention at the highest level
                        of the two governments. The first fruits of these negotiations were the
                        improved “Hotline” Agreement and the Agreement on Measures to Reduce the
                        Risk of Outbreak of Nuclear War.</p>
                    <p>The culmination of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks in 1972 brought the
                        Treaty on Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems limiting each side to two narrowly
                        circumscribed complexes. In my country it led in fact to dismantling an
                        anti-ballistic-missile complex already well under construction. By
                        renouncing major anti-ballistic-missile systems, the United States and the
                        Soviet Union gave up a potential new weapons system that they were in a
                        unique position to exploit. No other country could have built such
                        systems.</p>
                    <p>Along with the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, an interim agreement was worked
                        out to limit the number of strategic offensive launchers on both sides for
                        five years, a period that would provide time to achieve more comprehensive
                        limits.</p>
                    <p>At the summit meeting in the summer of 1974, the leaders of the United States
                        and Soviet Union took a further important step by negotiating the Threshold
                        Test Ban Treaty. I should point out that this was not only an important arms
                        control measure in its own right; it was also a positive step toward a
                        comprehensive test ban, to which we remain firmly committed.</p>
                    <p>Last November, at Vladivostok, a major milestone was reached when President
                            <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> and General Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> established specific
                        guidelines for a new agreement to limit strategic offensive arms. Based on
                        this accord, negotiations are now underway here in Geneva. The new agreement
                        is to limit strategic offensive armaments, including strategic bombers and
                        missiles equipped with multiple reentry vehicles (<gloss target="#t_MIRV_1"
                            >MIRVs</gloss>), to equal totals on each side.</p>
                    <pb n="482" facs="0516" xml:id="pg_482"/>
                    <p>The implications of this breakthrough are far-reaching. By putting an overall
                        ceiling on strategic armaments, we establish a promising basis for further
                        reductions. We look forward to follow-on negotiations on further limitation
                        and reductions as soon as the Vladivostok agreement is complete.</p>
                    <p>An encouraging precedent has already been set: only two years after the
                        Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty imposed comprehensive, equal ceilings on these
                        systems, both sides agreed to reduce the permitted deployment levels by
                        one-half.</p>
                    <p>Five years have now elapsed since the Nonproliferation Treaty went into
                        effect. This period is only one-sixth of the nuclear era that began at the
                        end of the Second World War. Yet, in this short time, far more has been
                        accomplished in the control of nuclear arms than in the preceding 25 years.
                        In historical perspective, the treaty has proven to be both a prerequisite
                        and a catalyst for progress toward nuclear disarmament. That process is
                        underway. And it is up to all of us to encourage and sustain it.</p>
                    <p>The Nonproliferation Treaty is indispensable to nuclear disarmament. It is
                        indispensable to achieving the maximum peaceful benefits of nuclear energy.
                        It is indispensable to the security of all. The task of this conference is
                        to provide the support and forward movement that are needed to enable the
                        treaty to fulfill its great promise.</p>

                        Week.</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Summary:</hi> Apart from organization of conference and
                        election of officers, first week devoted entirely to opening statements of
                        delegations. Principal themes were need for greater and faster progress in
                        achieving <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> and reductions in nuclear
                        weapons arsenals; desire for negative security assurances; and calls for
                        preferential treatment for <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> parties. <hi
                            rend="italic">End summary.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>2. Most delegations (other than <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, <gloss
                            target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> and Soviet bloc) stressed need for <gloss
                            target="#t_NWS_1">NWS</gloss> to reduce their nuclear arsenals,
                        asserting that <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> had not had this
                        result, and would stimulate a qualitative arms race.</p>
                    <p>3. Second most common theme was desirability of <gloss target="#t_CTB_1"
                            >CTB</gloss> (in many cases put as a ban on nuclear weapons tests, with
                        special provision for PNEs) as the single most important step that could now
                        be taken under Article VI.</p>
                    <p>4. A large number of delegations disparaged the value of Security Council Res
                        255 and called for undertakings by the <gloss target="#t_NWS_1">NWS</gloss>
                        not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against <gloss
                            target="#t_NNWS_1">NNWS</gloss> parties to the treaty (limited, in some
                        proposals, to those who were not members of alliances). Several pointed to
                        the possibility of such undertakings in connection with appropriate nuclear
                        free zones. The Japanese privately advised us that they would be content to
                        hold back on their proposal until most opportune time, but stressed the
                        importance to them, for domestic consumption, of taking such an
                        initiative.</p>
                    <p>5. There was widespread support for measures to improve the physical security
                        of nuclear materials, but no detailed suggestions. There was also widespread
                        agreement on the importance of <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>
                        safeguards.</p>
                    <p>6. A substantial number of delegations stated that nuclear supplier states
                        should require, as a condition of nuclear supplies, that recipient countries
                        that are <gloss target="#t_NNWS_1">NNWS</gloss> not party to <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> must subject their entire nuclear fuel
                        cycle to <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards, as <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> parties are themselves <pb n="484"
                            facs="0518" xml:id="pg_484"/>required to do. (The <gloss
                            target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>,
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss> did not advocate this solution). Several delegations
                        attempted to press the Soviets into making a voluntary safeguards offer such
                        as that made by the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>7. A number of delegations called for preferential treatment for <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> parties in international nuclear
                        cooperation and in technical and financial assistance to <gloss
                            target="#t_LDC_1">LDCs</gloss> as well as increases in the amounts
                        thereof. Several supported the idea of multinational reprocessing
                        plants.</p>
                    <p>8. Discussion of <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> was not extensive.
                        None of the delegations asserted that <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        technology had reached the point where it was clearly of benefit to the
                        parties and none expressed a desire to have a specific project carried out.
                        (But after a showing, during Friday’s luncheon break of Soviet films on
                        creating a reservoir and extinguishing a gas well fire, several delegations
                        privately indicated that this showed that <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNEs</gloss> could be useful.) The Nigerian delegate inferred from the
                        fact that the <gloss target="#t_NWS_1">NWS</gloss> had excepted <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> from the <gloss target="#t_TTB_1"
                            >TTB</gloss> and were negotiating a separate agreement on the subject
                        that they must see value in them. A large number of delegations considered
                        it important to set up an international <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        regime and to negotiate the agreement or agreements that would ensure that
                        the <gloss target="#t_NNWS_1">NNWS</gloss> parties could obtain <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> services on a non-discriminatory basis
                        when and if they proved of value. The <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>
                        idea of a <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> committee of the <gloss
                            target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> was mentioned by only a handful of
                        delegations. The Soviet statement that they were prepared to make <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> services available to <gloss
                            target="#t_NNWS_1">NNWS</gloss> whether or not they were parties to the
                        treaty was noted by the Philippines (which complained about the cost to the
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> of the new <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> unit in the Secretariat) and one or two
                        other delegations.</p>
                    <p>9. The Swiss—whose intervention was among the most negative of the
                        week—raised the issue of laser fusion. We subsequently furnished their
                        delegation, as well as the Australians, Dutch, Philippines and <gloss
                            target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> (all of whom requested it) with the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> statement on this subject. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MID_1">Morokhov</persName> (head of the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> del), Rometsch (<gloss
                            target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>) and the German delegation all said
                        privately that they were pleased with the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> handling of this problem.</p>
                    <p>10. A rather persistent theme was the need for the conference to come out
                        with concrete results and binding commitments, rather than mere rhetoric.
                        This desire was reflected in the Mexican and Romanian initiatives reported
                        septels.</p>
                    <p>11. Launching of the tripartite draft declaration ran into difficulties. A
                        number of delegations thought it was too bland, and privately expressed the
                        view that much would have to be added to it to make it fly. The Soviets
                        convened a group which preliminary soundings had indicated might be
                        considered “sympathizers”—including the Czechs, Austrians and Belgians—but
                        then proceeded to press them so hard to <pb n="485" facs="0519"
                            xml:id="pg_485"/>co-sponsor the draft without substantial change within
                        24 hours, that they balked. The <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> then held
                        a meeting of the <gloss target="#t_EC9_1">EC–9</gloss>, who decided it would
                        be a tactical mistake to surface the draft at this time, but said they would
                        offer comments and suggestions on it early next week.</p>
                    <p>12. The idea of a second review conference in 1980 received widespread
                        support (other than from the Soviet bloc). See also the Mexican resolution
                        on this subject, reported septel.</p>
                    <p>13. The issue of passing on the applications of Algeria, Cuba, Israel and
                        South Africa for observer status remained unresolved. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_TI_1">Thorsson</persName> and the committee chairmen will
                        meet again on this subject Tuesday morning. <persName corresp="#p_BWH_1"
                            >Barton</persName> (Canada) plans to make an effort to get agreement on
                        admitting them en bloc, but if separate consideration is required, his
                        fall-back would be to defer consideration of the South African application
                        (with the expectation that it would never be brought to the floor) and
                        meanwhile South African delegate would in fact continue to be present at the
                        meetings, but without a nameplate.</p>
                    <p>14. At this point, no supplementary instructions appear necessary (except as
                        requested in septel on Mexican res), but delegation would appreciate being
                        advised (i) when and if it can be authorized to make a statement, or support
                        a recommendation, on export credit financing; (ii) when and if it appears
                        possible to authorize the delegation to say anything beyond present
                        instructions with respect to the intention or determination or willingness
                        of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss> to follow the current <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> negotiations promptly with negotiations on possible
                        reductions and/or qualitative restrictions; and (iii) any relevant
                        congressional developments on safeguards or nonproliferation.</p>
                    <p>15. If usable analysis of qualitative restrictions included in the <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> I agreements is available, delegation
                        would appreciate receiving it.</p>
                    <p>16. Net assessment so far is that conference less negative than expected,
                        largely due to the fact that the balance of interest groups represented is
                        more favorable. Nevertheless, we expect to be given a hard time, even from
                        friendly delegations, especially on Article VI, <gloss target="#t_CTB_1"
                            >CTB</gloss> and negative security assurances. This prospect is all the
                        greater in view of the fact that the chairman of the committee considering
                        these matters is Amb <persName corresp="#p_CBA_1">Clark</persName> of
                        Nigeria, who is not expected to run a taut ship and whose sympathies are
                        strongly against our position.</p>

                    <p>Confidential talks on common understandings regarding nuclear export
                        safeguards and controls were held in London on April 23. The seven countries

                        discussed and views were exchanged on the types of controls that each
                        country would like to see implemented. There was generally agreement that
                        suppliers should require as a condition of nuclear export that:</p>

                        <p>—The recipient accept <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards
                            on such exports, with alternate safeguards being substituted only in
                            special cases and after consultation with the other suppliers.</p>
                        <p>—The recipient agree to apply adequate physical security measures to such
                            exports.</p>
                        <p>—Retransfers carry the same conditions governing the original export.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>There was also an indication of willingness to have bilateral consultation
                        among suppliers to discuss specific exports to sensitive countries or
                        regions where the risk of instability or conflict is present.</p>
                    <p>The only area where considerable differences existed was on the types of
                        safeguards and constraints to be implemented in the transfer of enrichment
                        and reprocessing facilities and technology. While not objecting to our
                        proposal to require multinational ownership and operation of such
                        facilities, the French would not support the condition <pb n="487"
                            facs="0521" xml:id="pg_487"/>that these exports be predicated on the
                        acceptance by the recipient of full safeguards on its entire fuel cycle and
                        a general non-proliferation commitment. The <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                            >FRG</gloss> generally supported the French position and others,
                        regardless of their specific views, would not agree to conditions more
                        stringent than the French will accept.</p>
                    <p>In preparation for the next meeting in London on June 18, the participants
                        asked the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to formulate and circulate a
                        new paper taking into account the views expressed in the exploratory meeting
                        as a basis for finding consensus. The Verification Panel Working Group has
                        prepared a draft of such a paper (Tab A). The areas in which agreement
                        existed are included as before, and the paper deals with the issue of
                        enrichment and reprocessing on a basis consistent with the strongest
                        safeguards condition thought to be acceptable to the French. Four conditions
                        would be imposed relative to reprocessing and enrichment.</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>—There would be mutual agreement between supplier and recipient as to
                            where nuclear material could be reprocessed and stored.</p>
                        <p>—Nuclear material could not be enriched in any enrichment facility to
                            weapons grade without the written consent of the supplier nation.</p>
                        <p>—Reprocessing and enrichment facilities would be multinationally owned,
                            involving as a minimum the direct participation by the supplier in its
                            management and technical operations.</p>
                        <p>—Any replicated facility would fall under the same restraints as were
                            applied to the original transfer.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Based on the various views expressed at the April meeting, and in the
                        interest of reaching consensus, this paper presents possible provisions for
                        safeguards and controls related to transfers, to any non-nuclear weapons
                        state for peaceful purposes, of (a) source and special fissionable
                            material;<note n="2" xml:id="d146fn2">As used in this paper, source and
                            special fissionable material are as defined in Article XX of the Statute
                            of the International Atomic Energy Agency. [Footnote is in the
                            original]</note> (b) facilities, equipment and components especially
                        designed for the processing, production, or use of special fissionable

                        construction, fabrication or operation of certain civil nuclear facilities

                        especially designed for such facilities. In connection with an agreement on
                        such provisions, suppliers will need to define an export “trigger” list
                        denoting quantities or assays of source and special nuclear material, and
                        relevant facilities, equipment and components. Suppliers will also need to
                        agree on common criteria for assessing significant technology transfer as
                        specified in paragraph A–4(a) below.</p>

                    <p>“It is very critical. I will be making a decision in the relatively near

                        sources of enriched uranium. We must do it. The basic problem is whether you
                        do it through government on the one hand or private enterprise on the other.
                        We will have a decision; we will get going because we cannot tolerate
                        further delay.</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brandon</persName>. Mr. President, there is
                        a great concern in the world about the proliferation of nuclear matter, and
                        the more nuclear power<pb n="494" facs="0528" xml:id="pg_494"/>plants are
                        going to be built, the more the United States is going to supply them, the
                        more of that material will be available in the world.</p>
                    <p>“I was wondering whether—the question is the reprocessing of this material. I
                        wonder whether it would be possible to find a multilateral way of trying to
                        reprocess this material, because there is a question of prestige with so
                        many governments involved.</p>
                    <p>“The President. We are concerned about the proliferation of nuclear
                        capability. We are trying to upgrade the safeguards when powerplants are
                        sold or made available. We think there has to be continuous consultation on
                        how we can do it technically and how we can do it diplomatically.</p>
                    <p>“We are going to maximize our effort, because if the number of nations having
                        nuclear armaments increases significantly, the risk to the world increases,
                        it multiplies. So, this Administration will do anything technically,
                        diplomatically, or otherwise to avert the danger that you are talking

                    <p>3. Full text of oral démarche as follows:</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Begin text:</hi> you will recall that on January 16,
                        Acting Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SW_2">Stabler</persName>
                        gave you a note verbale on the subject of Soviet nuclear tests and the
                        Moscow Treaty of August 5, 1963, which bans nuclear tests in the atmosphere,
                        in outer space, and underwater.</p>
                    <p>In that note, the Government of the United States drew the attention of the
                        Government of the Soviet Union to the fact that radioactive debris, directly
                        associated with the Soviet nuclear tests of August 29 and November 2, 1974,
                        had been collected outside of the borders of the Soviet Union by the United
                        States Government. These tests, therefore, became the 18th and 19th Soviet
                        nuclear explosions which, having caused radioactive debris to be present
                        outside of the Soviet borders, were made the subject of United States
                        Government communications to the Government of the Soviet Union on the
                        subject of Soviet compliance with the terms of the Treaty of Moscow.</p>
                    <p>The United States Government has reviewed the March 12 oral response of the
                        Government of the Soviet Union to the United States note verbale. This
                        statement, to the effect that appropriate Soviet authorities were and are
                        taking measures directed at fulfillment of the requirements of the Moscow
                        Treaty, does not offer sufficient reassurance. The United States Government
                        wishes to again state its expectation that the Soviet Government, as an
                        original party to the Moscow Treaty, will not only be taking measures
                        directed at fulfilling its treaty requirements, but will succeed in
                        fulfilling these requirements.</p>
                    <p>The Government of the United States wishes to stress once again that it joins
                        the Soviet Government in attaching great importance to the compliance of all
                        parties with the provisions of the 1963 Treaty of Moscow. The United States
                        Government is fully aware that the Soviet Government expects it to act in a
                        manner which will ensure its compliance with the Moscow Treaty, and assures
                        the Soviet Government that it is taking measures adequate to achieve this
                        end. The United States Government desires a similar assurance from the
                        Government of the Soviet Union that the Soviet Government will not cause
                        radioactive debris to be present outside its national territory. <hi

                    <p>The Threshold Test Ban Treaty (TTBT) signed in Moscow on July 3, 1974,
                        limited nuclear weapons tests to a maximum yield of 150 kilotons (<gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>). It also provided for follow-on
                        negotiations regarding peaceful nuclear explosions (<gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNEs</gloss>), which were not covered in the TTBT. Two rounds of
                        negotiations have been held in Moscow during October-November, 1974 and
                        February-March, 1975 and considerable progress has been made towards
                        reaching an agreement.</p>
                    <p>The next phase of the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> negotiations began
                        in Moscow on June 3 with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1"
                            >Stoessel</persName> continuing in charge of the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> Delegation. Based on the status of the negotiations and
                        the Verification Panel Working Group studies, I have drafted for your
                        approval instructions to the Delegation (Tab 1) and a note to be passed to
                        the Soviets in your channel (Tab 2). The main features of this approach
                        would be to:</p>
                    <p>—Reiterate our proposed 100 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> limit on
                        contained <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>, with provision for
                        observers. We could withdraw the observer provision if the Soviets accept
                        the 100 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> limit. Alternatively, if the
                        Soviets insist that larger contained <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>
                        are needed, we could accept a limit of 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1"
                            >KT</gloss> with observers.</p>
                    <p>—Reiterate our position that <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> events must
                        be fully consistent with the Limited Test Ban Treaty (<gloss
                            target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>) and question the Soviets on how major
                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> excavation projects could be
                        carried out consistent with the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>. In
                        our view, the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> would have to be
                        amended to permit the large radioactivity releases which would result from
                        major <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> excavation projects, and Congress
                        is unlikely to agree to amendment of the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1"
                            >LTBT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>—Privately propose to the Soviets a limit of 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1"
                            >KT</gloss> for individual excavation explosions, with provisions for
                        observers. Such a limit <pb n="497" facs="0531" xml:id="pg_497"/>would
                        ensure that the Soviets were not using <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>
                        for weapons test purposes otherwise prohibited by the TTBT. The Soviets have
                        indicated that they need individual explosive yields of several hundred
                        kilotons—preferably 500 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>—for a large canal
                        excavation project they have in mind to stabilize the water level in the
                        Caspian Sea. If they strongly insist on yields above 150 <gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>, we could reluctantly accept a limit of 250
                            <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>, but with considerably more
                        restrictive verification measures, including collection of radioactive
                        samples in the vicinity of the explosions.</p>
                    <p>—Continue to propose 500 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> as the aggregate
                        limit on multiple-shot excavation <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        salvos, but privately offer a higher limit of one megaton in exchange for
                        Soviet agreement to a yield limit of 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>
                        on each individual explosive device contained in the salvo. We would propose
                        similar ceilings for contained salvos, but with additional on-site
                        instrumentation to ensure that the individual yield limit is not
                        exceeded.</p>
                    <p>—Indicate to the Soviets that we would be willing to consider favorably their
                        proposal for <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> cooperation in the context
                        of adequate verification provisions. The Soviets have indicated that it
                        would be easier for them to allow observers (or “representatives” as they
                        prefer to call them) if the two sides have a <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> cooperation agreement.</p>
                    <p>The above approach is the same in substance as that recommended in the
                        interagency paper on <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>’s prepared for the
                        Verification Panel. It has the concurrence of all agencies.</p>
                    <p>A fuller analysis of the issues is provided in a Briefing Paper at Tab 3.</p>

                    <p>The President has approved the following instructions for the negotiations on
                        underground nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes (<gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>) which resumed in Moscow on June 3, 1975.
                        These instructions supplement those contained in <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1"
                            >NSDM</gloss> 287.</p>
                    <p>1. If individual explosions in a contained <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> salvo can be identified and their yields adequately
                        measured through agreed verification procedures, contained salvos with
                        aggregate yields up to 500 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> could be
                        permitted. With respect to verification of individual yields for contained
                        salvos with aggregate yield above 100 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>,
                        the Delegation should propose use of the <gloss target="#t_SLIFER_1"
                            >SLIFER</gloss> technique for determining yield.</p>
                    <p>2. The Delegation should reiterate our position that all <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> must be fully consistent with existing
                        treaty obligations, including the Limited Test Ban Treaty (<gloss
                            target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>). In addition, it should state that
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> studies indicate that it does not
                        appear to be possible to carry out major excavation <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> projects without violating the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1"
                            >LTBT</gloss>. The Delegation should solicit Soviet views on how they
                        plan to conduct <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> excavation projects
                        without violating the provisions of the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1"
                            >LTBT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>3. After presenting the above position on the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1"
                            >LTBT</gloss> issue, the Delegation should reiterate the position on
                        excavation <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> given in <gloss
                            target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 287, with the exception of continuing to
                        propose a 0.2 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> limit on <pb n="499"
                            facs="0533" xml:id="pg_499"/>the fission yield of each excavation <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> device. In this context, the Delegation
                        should:</p>
                    <p>(a) Reject the Soviet proposed gamma-mapping technique as inadequate for the
                        determination of fission yield.</p>
                    <p>(b) Propose that the distance between any two explosives in an excavation
                        salvo be limited to a distance greater than the emplacement depth of the
                        deeper of the pair of explosives.</p>
                    <p>(c) Insist on the right of drillback to recover below-ground melt samples for
                        any excavation event in which adequate above-ground samples are not
                        available.</p>
                    <p>4. The basic means for yield verification of all <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNEs</gloss> should be national technical means (teleseismic and
                        photographic) augmented by provisions for information exchange and on-site
                        observers. Observers should have rights to verify independently the
                        information exchanged. However, for events smaller than 50 kilotons,
                        independent verification by observers of information exchanged is not
                        required and the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> could forego the
                        exchange of detailed geological information and detailed project
                        descriptions.</p>
                    <p>5. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is willing to declare an
                        intention to cooperate in the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> field on
                        the basis of reciprocity and mutual benefit, in ways consistent with
                        applicable domestic laws. However, verification requirements for a <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> agreement pursuant to Article III of the
                        TTBT must be worked out before proceeding to discuss specific arrangements
                        for U.S./USSR <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> cooperation.</p>
                    <p>6. The President has decided that, in principle, the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> prefers a 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> limit on
                        individual excavation <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> and, in this
                        context, would be willing to accept a one megaton limit on the aggregate
                        yield of all salvos (contained and excavation) and forego the fission yield
                        limit and associated melt samples verification technique for excavation
                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>. While this position is approved
                        in substance, it should not be put forth by the Delegation until authorized
                        by Washington.</p>

                            >UK</gloss> have refused thus far to grant an exception in <gloss

                        a nuclear reactor to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. While we
                        have some reservations concerning the possible transfer of sensitive
                        technology, our position on the <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss>
                        exception has been based on our general policy of requiring the application

                            <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 261, which reiterated this policy

                        approve an exception in <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> to the
                        proposed sale of a West German-made nuclear reactor to the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. The equipment involved is a
                        computer-controlled 1,300 megawatt nuclear power plant containing a
                        pressurized water reactor, valued at $540 million, and 550,000 kilograms of
                        natural uranium, which will be enriched in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss> and used for the first fueling of the reactor, valued at
                        $75 million. The natural uranium furnished by the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                            >FRG</gloss> will be enriched in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss> and returned to the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>
                        for fabrication into fuel elements. The German firm negotiating the sale,
                        Kraftwerke-Union (<gloss target="#t_KWU_1">KWU</gloss>), will supply the
                        nuclear reactor and fuel; no production technology will be furnished to the
                        Soviets by the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>, and the <gloss
                            target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> has indicated that none of the equipment
                        or technology to be used in the plant is of direct <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> origin or is to be manufactured under a <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> licensing arrangement. There is
                        nevertheless some concern <pb n="501" facs="0535" xml:id="pg_501"/>that the
                        sale would lead to transfer of information and know-how which could assist
                        the Soviet naval nuclear propulsion program, and enhance their commercial
                        competitiveness in the nuclear power field.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> plans to locate the reactor in
                        Kaliningrad (formerly Königsberg, East Prussia) and to pay for the project
                        by exporting power from the plant to West Berlin and the <gloss
                            target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> via Poland and the <gloss
                            target="#t_GDR_1">GDR</gloss>. The transmission line from the reactor
                        would run through Poland and <gloss target="#t_GDR_1">GDR</gloss> territory
                        to the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>. Because the line will supply
                        the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> as well as West Berlin, any cut-off
                        would affect both. Thus, the political inhibitions against any Soviet
                        pressure on West Berlin arising from the arrangement would be strengthened.
                        The <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> has assured us that West Berlin’s
                        reserve capacity could in any case provide 80 percent of the city’s power
                        needs in case of a cutoff; the line between West Berlin and the <gloss
                            target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> could also carry a reverse power flow from
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> sources to augment this
                        capacity.</p>
                    <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Schmidt</persName> personally attaches
                        great importance to this project, as he considers that the successful
                        negotiation of these terms would constitute the most concrete Soviet
                        acknowledgment to date of the relationship between the <gloss

                    <p>At our request, <persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Schmidt</persName> asked the

                            >IAEA</gloss> safeguards on the reactor, but the Soviets refused. It is
                        unlikely that the Soviets would reverse their traditional position, i.e.,
                        that safeguards are pointless for advanced weapons powers, and are not
                        required of weapon states under the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                        >NPT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> and other Soviet leaders
                        emphasized to <persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Schmidt</persName> the importance
                        which they attach to the proposed sale, and they undertook to negotiate with
                        Poland and the <gloss target="#t_GDR_1">GDR</gloss> the requisite
                        rights-of-way for the power transmission. These talks may be deadlocked, and
                        if an impasse develops while the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        appears uncompromising in <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss>, then the
                        German press and public reaction might be to incorrectly place all of the
                        blame for the failure of the sale on the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss>, rather than recognizing the inter-Eastern bloc
                        disagreements. To avoid this politically undesirable outcome, a <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy shift which would permit the

                        requirement, if deemed appropriate, should be timed with the above in
                        mind.</p>
                    <p>The West German press has devoted considerable commentary to this subject,
                        much of which has erroneously accused us of blocking the German sale for our
                        own commercial advantage. (French officials have implied that they too
                        consider the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> position to be
                        commercially motivated.) German Government officials have continued to push
                        for a favorable <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> decision, and
                        Ambassador von Staden raised it with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"

                        approve the sale?</p>
                    <p>In deciding whether the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> should in
                        principle approve the sale, we must balance the commercial and strategic
                        risks of permitting some Western reactor technology to be transferred to the
                        Soviet Union against the political and material costs of opposing the
                        sale.</p>
                    <p>The strategic issue is very largely confined to such indirect assistance as
                        the proposed sale might provide to Soviet military programs through transfer
                        of western technology. Soviet stockpiles and production of fissionable
                        material are considered more than adequate for both military and civil
                        requirements. The probability of diversion of feed material supplied by the
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>, or the fissionable reactor
                        products, to Soviet military programs, is therefore considered to be very
                        low.</p>
                    <p>There is, however, a degree of risk that certain unclassified but important
                        technology and information could be indirectly transferred which would be
                        helpful in improving the Soviet naval nuclear propulsion program. There is
                        no evidence that specific sensitive components or technology relevant to
                        this program would be directly transferred, and this is considered unlikely.
                        However, some are concerned that the interrelationship between commercial
                        and military nuclear systems technology could permit, through
                        person-to-person contact over a lengthy period of time, inadvertent Soviet
                        access to information which could be helpful to their naval nuclear program.
                        Particularly if the sale involves Soviet visits to <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                            >FRG</gloss> plants, “black art” engineering know-how and proprietary
                        information may be inadvertently transferred. However, it is recognized that
                        sales by other Western countries pose fewer problems of this kind than
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> sales.</p>
                    <p>The possibility of technology transfer could also provide some limited
                        commercial benefits to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Soviet
                        light-water reactor technology appears to be inferior to that of the West in
                        some areas (e.g., welding, instrumentation, quality control, etc.), and much
                        of Soviet motivation may be to acquire Western technology to assist in
                        solving such problems. While again the amount of relevant technology that
                        might be transferred is not quantifiable, it could to some degree strengthen
                        the Soviet competitive position in the world reactor market. Given the
                        preeminent position of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> in this
                        field, however, the likelihood that this kind of assistance could result in
                        a substantial shift in the Soviet competitive position is not great.</p>
                    <p>While recognizing that there is inevitably some possibility that significant
                        technology may be inadvertently transferred in any nuclear <pb n="503"
                            facs="0537" xml:id="pg_503"/>export, some believe that on the basis of
                        our present knowledge, the risk involved in the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                            >FRG</gloss> sale is low. Moreover, it is worth noting that the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> agreed almost ten years ago to <gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> procedures which would permit the
                        export of reactors to bloc countries, provided only that <gloss
                            target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards, which do not affect the
                        technology transfer problem, were required. The <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> has in fact sold a large research reactor to Romania,
                        indicating that we have not in the past considered the technology transfer
                        problem to be significant where a sale involved primarily hardware.</p>
                    <p>The primary political considerations are the potential economic and political
                        benefits to Berlin, which underlie the intense interest of the <gloss
                            target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> in completing the sale. The proposed
                        arrangement is extremely important to assuring an adequate supply of
                        electrical power to West Berlin, and <persName corresp="#p_SH_1"
                            >Schmidt</persName> is personally committed to the effort to conclude a

                            >FRG</gloss>. While the Soviets would probably welcome a positive <gloss

                        in the matter would be significant in terms of the overall U.S./USSR

                        application for an exception on acceptance by the Soviet Union of <gloss
                            target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards on the reactor. Since it is
                        virtually certain that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> will not
                        accept the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards conditions,
                        this position is tantamount to a veto of the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                            >FRG</gloss> application.</p>
                    <p>The rationale for our present safeguards position in <gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss>, however, may be difficult to defend
                        as it applies to exports to advanced nuclear-weapons states such as the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. International safeguards are
                        designed to identify, and thereby to deter, the diversion of fissionable
                        material to nuclear explosive programs. This is done by international
                        inspection of and accounting for material flows within the reactor fuel
                        cycle. Particularly where it is clear that a nuclear power has an adequate
                        independent capability to produce sufficient fissionable material to meet
                        the needs of his military and civil nuclear programs, and therefore no
                        motive to divert imported materials, it may be questioned whether the
                        application of safeguards has more than a symbolic significance. In this
                        regard it is significant that the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> does
                        not require that nuclear weapons states accept <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1"
                            >IAEA</gloss> safeguards on their peaceful nuclear facilities (an
                        exemption which both the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and <gloss

                    <p>The United States however has consistently adhered to a policy of requiring
                        safeguards as a condition of <hi rend="italic">all</hi>
                        <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> nuclear assistance, including that to
                        other nuclear weapons states such as France, the <gloss target="#t_UK_1"
                            >UK</gloss>, and the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>. We have done
                        so in part because the importation of unsafeguarded nuclear materials or
                        equipment may involve valid concerns about diversion, particularly in the
                        case of nuclear weapons states whose indigenous stockpiles or production
                        capabilities are a constraining factor for military programs. Moreover, even
                        where diversion is not of real concern, we have felt that the acceptance of
                        safeguards by nuclear weapons states is indeed important for symbolic and
                        political reasons. Uniform application of safeguards reduces the
                        discriminatory aspects of the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> to which
                        many non-nuclear weapons states object, both as recipients and as potential
                        exporters of nuclear assistance; and thereby enhances the acceptability of
                        the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>. Thus, it was largely in support of
                        political and non-proliferation objectives that the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> voluntarily
                        offered to place our own civilian power programs under <gloss

                        no significant effect in reducing or controlling the risk. In effect, our
                        current <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> position relies on the

                            xml:id="pg_505"/>and the result has been to obscure the true issue of
                        possible transfer of strategic technology.</p>
                    <p>The alternative to existing <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy in
                            <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> would be to insist upon <gloss
                            target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards as a condition of exceptions
                        only where the risk of diversion of fissionable materials can be
                        persuasively argued (<hi rend="italic">always</hi> in the case of
                        non-nuclear weapons states). Where other strategic concerns such as
                        technology transfer justified a veto, we would continue to disapprove <gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> exceptions, but not on the grounds of
                        safeguard application. In the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> case
                        under consideration at present, this would mean dropping or finessing the
                        safeguard condition, and resting the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        position solely on the question of technology transfer.</p>
                    <p>Adopting such a policy within <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> would
                        not necessarily affect existing <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy
                        with regard to safeguards requirements on <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> exports. We could continue to insist upon safeguards on
                            <hi rend="italic">all <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        </hi> nuclear exports, and could continue to urge that other countries
                        pursue a similar policy to support mutual nonproliferation objectives. To do
                        this, however, would place <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> firms at a
                        competitive disadvantage within the limited Soviet market, unless and until
                        the Soviet Union is willing to accept safeguard conditions. Moreover, this
                        shift in our policy in <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> could
                        adversely affect our nonproliferation interests by permitting non-weapon
                        states to charge that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is moving
                        back toward discriminatory application of safeguards on nuclear exports. We
                        could, however, respond to such charges by saying that although we continued
                        to believe that all states should be willing to accept safeguards on their
                        peaceful nuclear facilities, to advocate this position internationally, and
                        to make it a requirement on <hi rend="italic">
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        </hi> nuclear exports, it was not reasonable to coerce other nations to
                        adopt our viewpoint through voluntary cooperative mechanisms such as <gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss>. The shift could nonetheless have an
                        adverse impact upon the forthcoming <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>
                        review conference and upon international reactions to the common supplier
                        policies we are trying to establish.</p>
                    <p>Another alternative would be to modify our <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1"
                            >COCOM</gloss> policy on safeguards and at the same time drop the
                        safeguards requirement as a condition of licensing <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> sales to nuclear-weapons states, on a selective and
                        case-by-case basis. This would permit <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        industry to compete on an equal basis for the Soviet market, but might have
                        even more serious consequences for our non-proliferation interests.</p>

                    <p>Several additional proposals have been suggested which would substitute some
                        other type of restriction, more acceptable to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss>, for the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards
                        requirement. For example, we might insist that the spent fuel rods from the
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> reactor, or the fissionable
                        materials extracted from them (or equivalent amounts), be returned to the

                        proposals would be to permit the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> sale
                        to proceed, while fulfilling the substance of safeguards without actual
                        inspection on Soviet territory. It could then be argued that the functional
                        equivalent of safeguards had been achieved. The main difficulty of these
                        proposals is that they do little to support either our strategic or
                        non-proliferation objectives. The risk of technology transfer is unaffected,
                        while the political benefits of a non-discriminatory safeguards policy may
                        be diluted.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>It is important that in deciding upon our position with respect to the <gloss
                            target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> proposal, we take into account the
                        desirability of maintaining an even-handed approach to exports to the <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss>. This problem will not arise if we hold to our current
                        position of insisting upon <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>
                        safeguards, since the same condition would be applicable to the <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> under <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1"
                            >NSDM</gloss> 261.</p>
                    <p>A <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> veto based on the technology transfer
                        issue would also avoid this problem, at least for the present. While it is
                        possible that some future nuclear exports might pose widely dissimilar
                        technological risks in the two countries, and hence result in
                        “discriminatory” treatment, this does not appear very likely and could be
                        handled on a case-by-case basis.</p>
                    <p>Modification of our policy on <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss>
                        safeguards requirements as discussed above could result in “discriminatory”
                        treatment. Theoretically, because of its smaller indigenous stockpiles and
                        production capacity, it must be assumed that the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                            >PRC</gloss> would be somewhat more tempted to divert imported nuclear
                        materials or equipment to support military programs. However, only
                        light-water power reactors and slightly enriched fuel are likely candidates
                        for sale to the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> in the foreseeable
                        future; the <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 261 study’s conclusion,
                        that diversion of these items by the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> is
                        highly unlikely, apparently remains valid.”</p>
                    <p>Adoption of one of the safeguard substitutes for the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                            >FRG</gloss> sale to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> could
                        pose more difficult problems. These options are designed to permit us to
                        drop the requirement for actual inspection on Soviet territory, while
                        maintaining some meaningful ability to detect any significant diversion of
                        reactor products by monitoring the electrical power output of the facility
                        as delivered to the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> and West Berlin.
                        This possibility is unique to arrangements where the exported reactor is
                        used solely for supply of power outside the territory of the recipient.
                        Nevertheless, by crossing the line of “substitute safeguards,” we could open
                        ourselves to requests for other kinds of substitutes from the <gloss

                        PROPOSAL TO HAVE NEXT ENRICHMENT PLANTS BUILT BY PRIVATE INDUSTRY</p>
                    <p>This paper attempts to review the safeguard and non-proliferation aspects of
                        the Administration’s proposal to have the next major increment of <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> enrichment capacity, financed, constructed
                        and operated by <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> private industry. In
                        this regard the following principal questions are addressed:</p>
                    <p>(a) Will the proposal significantly add in any way to the risks that the
                        enriched uranium produced by the proposed new plants will fall into
                        unauthorized hands in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>?</p>
                    <p>(b) Is the proposal likely to compromise in any significant way the rigorous
                        classification and related constraints that now apply to sensitive <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> enrichment technology?</p>
                    <p>(c) Is the proposal likely to contribute in any way to the problem of
                        international proliferation by encouraging the spread of <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> or other enrichment technologies around
                        the world?</p>
                    <p>To place these questions in perspective it should be noted that the
                        Government has, for approximately 30 years, relied on private contractors to
                        operate the three <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> diffusion plants. At
                        the present time sensitive technology involved in the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> gaseous diffusion plants and centrifuge
                        facilities is classified as Restricted Data and the facilities themselves
                        are subjected to government requirements for physical security protection,
                        nuclear materials accountability as well as governmental inspection and
                        inventory verification. There are severe criminal penalties for anyone who
                        discloses <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Restricted Data to an
                        unauthorized person. Also, pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act, special

                        Additionally, no <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Restricted Data,
                        including that pertaining to enrichment, may be transferred to another

                        cooperation, which would be subject to congressional review. With the
                        exception of an early arrangement with the United Kingdom, which was
                        terminated several years ago, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has
                        not transferred any classified enrichment technology to any other nation. In
                        general the other countries engaged in major enrichment projects (including
                        France, <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>, Netherlands,
                        South Africa and the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>) have also kept
                        their programs highly classified. The German jet nozzle process which may be
                        made available by the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> to Brazil is,
                        however, not classified. With these factors in mind the following paragraphs
                        address the principal questions noted above.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Disposition of the Plant Products</p>
                    <p>The proposed program favoring private installation is not expected to reduce
                        in any way the various constraints that now govern the distribution of
                        enriched uranium domestically as well as overseas. Indeed, since 1954, the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has operated under a regime of
                        private ownership of nuclear power reactors, as well as fuel fabrication and
                        chemical reprocessing plants. Private ownership of enriched uranium and
                        plutonium also have been permitted for over ten years. The proposition of
                        having the next enrichment plants operated by the private sector therefore
                        should not introduce any inherently new risks into the picture, and the
                        enriched uranium produced by these plants will be subjected to the full
                        range of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> domestic and export
                        regulations.</p>
                    <p>Only authorized persons will be enabled to possess such materials and exports
                        only will take place pursuant to an inter-governmental agreement for
                        cooperation, as well as an approved export license. Such a license is issued
                        only after a thorough review of all relevant implications and following a
                        determination that the export would not be inimical to the interests of the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Our agreements for cooperation
                        governing the export of enriched uranium call for the application of
                        international safeguards on the materials transferred as well as all
                        generations of plutonium produced therefrom. These controls are designed to
                        detect and thus deter any diversions to military uses. Comprehensive <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> bilateral safeguards come into effect if
                        the international safeguards terminate for any reason. Moreover,
                        quantitative limitations are placed in these agreements on the total amount
                        of enriched uranium that may be transferred to a cooperating country and
                        fuel is exported only when it is needed in a defined peaceful project.
                        Moreover, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has various ancillary
                        rights designed to reinforce the <pb n="512" facs="0546" xml:id="pg_512"
                        />safeguards and guarantee provisions. These include opportunities to
                        actively participate in the decision as to where the transferred fuel might
                        be reprocessed. All of these constraints which now govern the exports of
                        government-produced enriched uranium would apply with equal force to the
                        products of the proposed new private enrichment plants.</p>
                    <p>It also should be noted that the <gloss target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss> plant
                        will be designed to produce only the low enriched uranium that is needed for
                        most <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-type nuclear power reactors.
                        Moreover, since the government would continue to control all exports, <gloss
                            target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss> would consult at an early stage with the
                        government to verify the acceptability of any prospective foreign investor
                        wishing to obtain access to its product.</p>
                    <p>The principal responsibility for assuring that adequate safeguards and
                        physical protective measures will apply to the proposed new private plants
                        will fall on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <gloss target="#t_NRC_1"
                            >NRC</gloss> intends to proceed promptly with the development of the
                        necessary safeguards and associated protective measures; these may have a
                        bearing on the optimal design of the plant and may figure in the initial
                        licensing actions. Since several years will be required to construct the
                        facility <gloss target="#t_NRC_1">NRC</gloss> will benefit from any further
                        advances that are made in safeguard techniques, including the experience
                        acquired by the International Atomic Energy Agency in this area.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> the question arises
                        as to whether the <gloss target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss> plant and the
                        proposed follow-on gas centrifuge facilities will now fall under the terms
                        of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Presidential offer to place the
                        entire <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> nuclear program under <gloss
                            target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards excluding only those
                        activities having a “direct national security significance.” This is an
                        issue that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government would propose
                        to address at such time as the proposed new facilities near completion. If
                        it appears at that time that the subject facilities meet the test of the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> offer then we would be prepared to
                        have them subjected to <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards.
                        If, however, these enrichment facilities are judged at that time to have
                        direct national security significance they will not be incorporated under
                        the scope of the offer.</p>

                        by “Privatization?”</p>
                    <p>The government will continue to require the classification and security
                        protection of that aspect of gaseous diffusion and gas centrifuge technology
                        which is judged to be sensitive and necessary to protect for national
                        security purposes. In general, and because of non-proliferation
                        considerations centrifuge technology is considered to be more sensitive than
                        the gaseous diffusion process.</p>
                    <pb n="513" facs="0547" xml:id="pg_513"/>
                    <p>With the increase in the number of enrichment plants in the United States it
                        is anticipated that a greater number of appropriately cleared <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> citizens will have access to enrichment
                        technology. The principal factor occasioning this increase will be the
                        expansion in our capacity and scale up of the centrifuge, rather than the
                        proposal to move to private ownership, per se. Had the government elected to
                        install the capacity itself it too would have had to rely on private
                        contractors to design, build and operate the plants. Every effort, however,
                        will continue to be made to restrict the dissemination of sensitive design
                        parameters, components (seals and compressors) and manufacturing processes.
                        Moreover, the concept of “need to know” will continue to apply to such
                        access. <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss> is now performing a
                        classification review of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> gaseous
                        diffusion process to determine if any declassifications can be made which
                        would assist in the production and procurement of components, and the
                        construction of an enrichment plant. Much useful data, enabling prospective
                        investors to meaningfully assess the economics and efficiency of the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> gaseous diffusion process, already has
                        been declassified.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Is Private Enrichment Likely to Contribute to the
                        Spread of the Nuclear Enrichment Technology Around the World?</p>
                    <p>On the whole we believe that a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> move to
                        now place new capacity promptly in place will deter the installation of
                        additional foreign capacity and foster our non-proliferation objectives,
                        including the acceptance of safeguards.</p>
                    <p>Although the transfer to the private sector can be expected to build up a
                        private equity in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> enrichment technology
                        and possibly some incentive for foreign ties, no widespread dissemination of
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> information to other nations is
                        foreseen at this time. As noted, sensitive enrichment technology will remain
                        classified and prospective foreign investors will not have access to such
                        classified information. Moreover, the export constraints and controls as now
                        apply to government-generated information will apply to information and
                        technology advancements generated by <gloss target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss>
                        and other elements of the private sector. We can expect prospective private
                        enrichers to be fairly sensitive on their own about protecting their
                        technological leadership and proprietary information in this field.</p>
                    <p>Any proposed sharing of technology with other countries would have to be
                        taken up as a separate matter and would necessarily involve affirmative
                        governmental approvals of the necessary arrangements. In this regard, within
                        the context of the activities of the International Energy Agency, the United
                        States has expressed a willingness to explore cooperation in either the
                        gaseous diffusion or gas centrifuge fields. We have made it clear, however,
                        that in the first instances, we would <pb n="514" facs="0548"
                            xml:id="pg_514"/>expect any such proposals on the <gloss

                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> enrichers. Thereafter, any such
                        proposals would have to be carefully evaluated by the government taking into
                        account various explicitly stated criteria, including compatibility of the
                        arrangements with surety of supply for the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> domestic market and with <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> national security interests. At this stage the specific
                        character of any cooperative arrangements that might so develop is not
                        known. However, the recent decision favoring “the introduction of private
                        industry” is not expected to alter the picture since (a) all proposals for
                        technology sharing will be subjected to a very intensive review and (b) the
                        current IEA ground rules were, in fact, developed with advent of <gloss

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Overall Conclusions</p>
                    <p>Overall, this paper concludes that the Administration’s proposal to have the

                        privately built will not have any adverse effects on <gloss target="#t_US_1"

                        prudent controls will be necessary in the future, these will be dictated
                        primarily by the growth in the industry and technological advances, rather
                        than the mode of facility ownership.</p>

                        persuade the Koreans to abandon their plans to purchase a reprocessing plant
                        from France. In view of recent public controversy surrounding our attempts
                        to head off a similar <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> sale of a
                        reprocessing plant to Brazil and recognizing the particular concern in the
                        Korean case of minimizing any adverse impact on our security relationship,
                        it is clear that a policy level decision is required prior to implementation
                        of any such approach. Consequently, at a <gloss target="#t_VPWG_1"
                            >VPWG</gloss> meeting last week, we tasked the bureaucracy to prepare an
                        options paper on these issues. State (<gloss target="#t_SP_1">S/P</gloss>)
                        initially accepted this task but is now attempting, with <gloss
                            target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> concurrence, to treat the issue as an
                        internal State matter which they would forward to Secretary <persName

                    <p>The State/<gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> opposition to <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> review in this case is apparently based on
                        a fear that if they yield on this point, then all other proliferation
                        initiatives will be controlled by <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>. We
                        believe there are two compelling reasons for asserting our control in this
                        area:</p>
                    <p>—First, this issue has important implications for both <gloss

                        interests and it is essential that these agencies be fully involved through
                        the interagency process.</p>
                    <p>—Second, non-proliferation policy involves numerous and diverse actions which
                        we have been trying to integrate under a comprehensive review process to
                        ensure orderly and consistent decision making. Allowing our tasking to be
                        ignored in this manner would seriously <pb n="516" facs="0550"
                            xml:id="pg_516"/>undermine the Verification Panel process in this area
                        and could also weaken our control of other arms control issues as well.</p>

                            >Eagleburger</persName>). This paper does not address the possible
                        impact of such an approach on our defense relationship with Korea but
                        implicitly assumes that the defense relationship can be decoupled from this
                        problem.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Previous Bilateral Approaches</p>
                    <p>In previous expressions of our concern we have given the South Koreans an
                        aide-mémoire which interprets our Agreement for Cooperation as providing for
                        an effective <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> veto right over
                        reprocessing of spent fuel from <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-built
                        reactors. The <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> is studying this
                        interpretation and is expected to respond soon. Canada who is also
                        negotiating the sale of one of its reactors to Korea, has expressed similar
                        concerns and may condition the sale on <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss>
                        foregoing fuel reprocessing.</p>
                    <p>In a bilateral discussion prior to the Nuclear Suppliers Conference, we told
                        the French that we were considering approaching the Koreans on this issue.
                        They replied that if we succeeded in persuading the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1"
                            >ROK</gloss> to cancel its plans, they would have no objection provided
                        that their reprocessing firm, St. Gobain, would be reimbursed for its
                        roughly four million dollars in expenditures to date.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Prospects</p>
                    <p>Reprocessing will not be necessary for South Korea’s nuclear power economy
                        for several years and, in view of current controversy over the dangers of
                        plutonium recycle, perhaps not for the foreseeable future. Both officials
                        concerned with civil power development and those in favor of weapons
                        production could probably be persuaded to defer the reprocessing effort, if
                        necessary, to avoid jeopardizing acquisition of essential nuclear power
                        reactors. We are pessimistic about longer term prospects, however, since the
                        basic incentives for <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> nuclear weapons
                        development will remain and they could either approach another supplier or
                        eventually build their own reprocessing plant.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Remaining Issues</p>
                    <p>In reaching your decision on this issue, you should also consider its
                        implications for our overall nonproliferation policy. As a result of <gloss
                            target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> and French opposition, it is now clear
                        that the Nuclear Suppliers Conference, if successful, will result in
                        controls on reprocessing that are considerably less stringent than those we
                        would impose on South Korea. Following the conclusion of a Suppliers’
                        agreement, it is conceivable that the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss>
                        would approach another supplier such as the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                            >FRG</gloss> and purchase a reprocessing plant under the agreed
                        guidelines and we would then find it more difficult to interfere. In such an
                        event, our own nuclear industry could claim that it should be permitted to
                        export under the same conditions as the other suppliers.</p>
                    <pb n="519" facs="0553" xml:id="pg_519"/>
                    <p>The real question as we work toward the goals of conclusion of a Suppliers
                        Agreement, of strengthened <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards
                        and of increased <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> ratification is
                        whether we will be willing to accept these as adequate controls both in
                        terms of permitting <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> exports on this
                        basis and not objecting to bilateral arrangements between other suppliers
                        and client states. In this regard, a comprehensive review of our
                        non-proliferation policy is in progress in the <gloss target="#t_VPWG_1"
                            >VPWG</gloss> and may serve as a useful basis for determining the extent
                        to which we should continue to play an activist role in bilateral approaches
                        rather than being content with the international regulatory mechanisms we
                        are developing. However, the Korean problem is somewhat time-urgent and this
                        study will not be completed in time to serve as a basis for your decision on
                        the Korean approach.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Options</p>
                    <p>The State proposal would have the advantage of closely following the Canadian
                        démarche and would exert maximum pressure on the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1"
                            >ROK</gloss> to abandon its plans. It would also be timely and perhaps
                        improve the prospects for pending Congressional approval of the
                        Export-Import Bank loan and Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing of a
                        final shipment for the KORI–I reactor. It would have some risk, however, of
                        antagonizing the Koreans and, through public disclosure, irritating the
                        French who have already complained about publicity on the Suppliers
                        Conference. If successful, the question would also remain of who would
                        reimburse the French for their four million dollars in development
                        costs.</p>
                    <p>Alternatively we could wait for the Korean responses to our Aide Mémoire and
                        the Canadian démarche. If they accept our conditions, it would distinctly
                        lessen the risk of diversion through reprocessing of spent fuel from <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> reactors, and we could rely on their
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> obligations and the Suppliers
                        Agreement as further barriers to proliferation. If they cannot reprocess
                        fuel from either the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> or future Canadian
                        reactors, then South Korea might decide without further pressure to defer
                        its reprocessing plans. If they reject our aide-mémoire we could then
                        consider a somewhat stronger approach than the one outlined in the
                        cable.</p>

                        and trying to assess the significance of that fact we cannot come to any
                        optimistic conclusion—and that is the agreement between West Germany and
                        Brazil to provide nuclear reactors and other equipment. Our assessment is
                        like that of others—that Brazil is on the path to the production of nuclear
                        weapons and want to use the help provided by West Germany. Am I right that
                        this isn’t a theoretical problem but a problem of practical policy? It
                        concerns our two states as parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
                        Incidentally, Germany is party to the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>,
                        but Brazil is not.</p>
                    <p>“You are located closer to Brazil geographically and politically. And we
                        believe you are more aware of how West Germany is breathing in this
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>“<persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We don’t believe Brazil
                        has decided to build nuclear weapons but this deal creates the possibility
                        and we are concerned for the future. When a complete fuel cycle is provided,
                        it provides the possibility to obtain fuel. But we are concerned and have
                        expressed our concern publicly.</p>
                    <p>“We had hoped this suppliers’ conference would agree on safeguards. But if it
                        doesn’t, we would be prepared to exchange views bilaterally, because it is a
                        dangerous development.” (Ibid., <ref target="frus1969-76v16#d162">Document

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Regional Factors</p>
                    <p>If Korea begins to build a reprocessing plant in addition to the essential
                        nuclear reactors we have agreed to supply, it will be widely assumed that it
                        is seriously working on a nuclear weapons program. This perception would be
                        potentially destabilizing in all of northeast Asia. North Korea would
                        certainly press its allies for a similar capability, and both China and the
                        Soviet Union might see potential nuclear threats to their own territory.
                        Perhaps most important, development of nuclear weapons in Korea could tip
                        the balance on proliferation in Japan.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Korean Intentions</p>
                    <p>Korea’s policy towards future development of a nuclear weapons capability
                        seems fairly clear from intelligence regarding their armament program plans
                        and from Park’s statement indicating that exercise of the nuclear option
                        would depend on the continuation of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        security guarantees. Unfortunately, this Korean attitude is well-known in
                        Congress and in the international arms control community. It will make it
                        very difficult for the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to continue
                        normal civil nuclear commerce with Korea unless some specific protective
                        measures are taken.</p>
                    <p>Reprocessing will not be necessary for South Korea’s nuclear power economy
                        for several years and, in view of current controversy over <pb n="522"
                            facs="0556" xml:id="pg_522"/>the dangers of plutonium recycle, perhaps
                        not for the foreseeable future. Both officials concerned with civil power
                        development and those in favor of weapons production could probably be
                        persuaded to defer the reprocessing effort, if necessary, to avoid
                        jeopardizing acquisition of essential nuclear power reactors. We are
                        pessimistic about longer term prospects, however, since the basic incentives
                        for <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> nuclear weapons development will
                        remain and they could either approach another supplier or eventually build
                        their own reprocessing plant.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Korean Assurances</p>
                    <p>Korea has taken some steps recently in order to reassure us and others that

                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> when Canada made it a condition of
                        acquisition of Canadian reactors, they recently accepted our tortured
                        interpretation of our bilateral nuclear agreement that gives the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> veto rights on reprocessing of spent fuel
                        from <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> supplied reactors, and have
                        provided similar assurances to Canada.</p>
                    <p>The Koreans undoubtedly have their limits, though, and the request from the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> for them to forego a planned
                        reprocessing plant may approach that limit. Compounding this is the fact
                        that they might also have to pay certain termination costs as discussed
                        below.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The French Connection</p>
                    <p>The reprocessing plant that the Koreans are planning to acquire is of French
                        origin. In a bilateral discussion prior to the nuclear suppliers conference
                        we told the French that we were considering approaching the Koreans on this
                        issue. They replied that if we succeeded in persuading the <gloss
                            target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> to cancel its plans, they would have no
                        objection provided that their reprocessing firm, St. Gobain, would be
                        reimbursed for its $4 million in expenditures to date.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Implications for Non-Proliferation Policy</p>
                    <p>In reaching your decision on this issue, you should also consider its
                        implications for our overall non-proliferation policy. As a result of <gloss
                            target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> and French opposition, it is now clear
                        that the Nuclear Suppliers Conference will result in controls on
                        reprocessing that are less stringent than those in the <gloss
                            target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>-Brazil nuclear accord and considerably
                        less stringent than those we would impose on South Korea. In a recent
                        bilateral discussion, the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> informed us
                        that they would wait until after the conclusion of the Suppliers Conference
                        to finalize their umbrella agreement with Iran probably with the expectation
                        that we would not oppose exports which were in accordance with the
                        Suppliers’ agreement. Similarly, following the conclusion of a Suppliers’
                        agreement, it is conceivable that the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss>
                        would approach another supplier <pb n="523" facs="0557" xml:id="pg_523"
                        />such as the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> and purchase a
                        reprocessing plant under the agreed guidelines and we would then find it
                        more difficult to interfere.</p>
                    <p>The real question as we work toward the goals of conclusion of a Suppliers
                        Agreement, of strengthened <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards
                        and of increased <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> ratification is
                        whether we will be willing to accept these as adequate controls both in
                        terms of permitting <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> exports on this
                        basis and not objecting to bilateral arrangements between other suppliers
                        and client states. In this regard, a comprehensive review of our
                        non-proliferation policy is in progress in the <gloss target="#t_VPWG_1"
                            >VPWG</gloss> and may serve as a useful basis for determining the extent
                        to which we should continue to play an activist role in bilateral approaches
                        rather than being content with the international regulatory mechanisms we
                        are developing. However, this study will not be completed in time to serve
                        as a basis for your decision on the Korean approach.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Options</p>
                    <p>The State proposal would have the advantage of closely following the Canadian
                        démarche and would utilize our special leverage to exert maximum pressure on
                        the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> to abandon its plans. It would also
                        be timely, and if the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> agrees, would
                        improve the prospects for pending congressional approval of the
                        Export-Import Bank loan and Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing of fuel
                        shipment for the KORI–I reactor. The approach would have some risk, however,
                        of antagonizing the Koreans and, through public disclosure, irritating the
                        French who have already complained about publicity on the Suppliers
                        Conference.</p>
                    <p>If successful, the question would also remain of who would reimburse the
                        French for their four million dollars in development costs. On the basis of
                        a preliminary examination, we have not identified any reasonable method of
                        paying the French directly—which would be interpreted in Congress as “buying
                        them off,” or of compensating the Koreans through our <gloss
                            target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> or Military Assistance (they are already
                        unhappy over reduced amounts in the latter program). Thus, it appears that
                        we would have to either force the Koreans to absorb these costs or ignore
                        the French demand at the risk of losing their cooperation in the Suppliers
                        Conference.</p>
                    <p>Alternatively, we could rely on Korea’s <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>
                        obligations—including safeguards in its facilities and nuclear explosive
                        deployment prohibitions, their assurances that they will not reprocess fuel
                        from Canadian or <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> reactors, and
                        additional barriers coming out of the Suppliers’ Agreement, to satisfy our
                        concerns. Unfortunately, such undertakings can be considered as mere “paper
                        assurances” and some elements of Congress see it in these terms. In
                        addition, if the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> proceeds with this
                        reprocessing plant, its neighbors would assume it is seriously working
                        towards a nuclear weapons capability.</p>

                        to begin in Moscow on September 5. With the exception of an allowance for
                        some <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> above 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1"
                            >KT</gloss>, most of the remaining differences between the two sides
                        appear amenable to resolution.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                    <p>In our May private note we had proposed that all individual <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> yields be limited to 150 <gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> with an aggregate yield limit on <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> groups of one megaton. We pointed out that
                        this would enhance public <pb n="525" facs="0559" xml:id="pg_525"
                        />acceptance of both the TTBT and <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        agreement, and would permit less complex verification provisions. Just prior
                        to your Geneva meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>
                        in July, the Soviets accepted this basic approach, but asked that a “limited
                        number” of individual excavation <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> be
                        allowed to exceed the 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> threshold. They
                        also proposed that observers be permitted between 100 and 150 <gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> only at the discretion of the host side and
                        for all <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> above 150 <gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>, observers would be allowed at the
                        discretion of the verifying side. At our request, they tabled this position
                        at the conclusion of the last round of <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        talks.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Outstanding Issue</p>
                    <p>The major outstanding issue is the Soviet proposal to allow a “limited
                        number” of individual excavation <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> with
                        yields greater than 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>. <persName
                            corresp="#p_IFC_1">Fred Iklé</persName> has written to you expressing
                        his view that we should not permit explosions above the 150 <gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> threshold. Our comments are at Tab C.
                        Whether to permit a small number of excavation shots with yields above 150
                            <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> is a difficult question since <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> above the threshold could cause serious
                        verification problems and would undoubtedly lead to strong Senate and public
                        criticism that such shots would violate the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1"
                            >LTBT</gloss>. On the other hand, the right to have <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> above the threshold has been a key Soviet
                        objective from the outset of the <gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss> talks,
                        and was the reason that a separate <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        negotiation was necessary. It is unclear whether they would be willing to
                        abandon that goal.</p>
                    <p>We do not believe that the exceptions issue needs to be resolved at this
                        time. There is general bureaucratic agreement that, if only for tactical
                        reasons, we should begin this round by opposing any exceptions, as we did in
                        our May private note. We would also table ad referendum treaty language
                        consistent with our May note although a small amount of editing by the
                        Verification Panel Working Group remains to be done in the next few days.
                        The <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> authorizes the delegation to
                        table the draft treaty which we will convey upon completion of this work.
                        This would bring our Moscow position into agreement with our position in
                        your channel. It would also be responsive to Soviet concerns that we should
                        begin negotiating treaty language and would represent considerable <gloss

                        “exceptions.”</p>
                    <p>We plan to continue work on an analysis of the exceptions issue, taking into
                        account the Soviet positions in the next few weeks, with the goal of a
                        decision, probably requiring a <gloss target="#t_VP_1">VP</gloss> meeting,
                        later this month.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Draft Treaty</p>
                    <p>The working group has prepared an interagency discussion paper and a draft
                        treaty with two associated Protocols (Tab B). These documents have the
                        general concurrence of all agency representatives on <pb n="526" facs="0560"
                            xml:id="pg_526"/>the Working Group. The draft treaty is consistent with
                        our May note and previous guidance and contains the following key
                        elements:</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Individual Yield Limits.</hi> All <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNEs</gloss> would be restricted to an individual yield limit of 150
                            <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Aggregate Yield Limit.</hi> All <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> group explosions would be restricted to an aggregate yield
                        limit of one megaton. The Soviet proposal suggests an aggregate limit of two
                        megatons; however, as this yield limit increases above one megaton, there is
                        some risk that an individual “above-threshold” shot might be hidden in the
                        overall ground shock caused by the group.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Distinction between Excavation and Contained <gloss
                                target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>.</hi> The treaty does not distinguish
                        between excavation and contained <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>,
                        since with the yield restrictions noted above, the 0.2 <gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> fission yield restriction on excavation
                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> and its attendant melt sample
                        collection and analysis is not required. A third protocol which sets forth
                        this provision and its related verification procedures has been prepared for
                        use if we eventually decide to permit exceptions.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Yield Limit Verification.</hi> For <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> events below 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1"
                            >KT</gloss>, verification would be by national technical means
                        supplemented by information exchange. For <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> group yields above 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>,
                        seismometers and electrical yield measurement devices (<gloss
                            target="#t_SLIFER_1">SLIFERs</gloss>) would be emplaced on-site. The
                        Soviets have proposed use of instruments that are similar to <gloss
                            target="#t_SLIFER_1">SLIFERs</gloss>, but in <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1"
                            >ERDA</gloss>’s view are considerably less accurate and subject to
                        “spoofing”. They have also argued that the equipment to be used by the
                        verifying side should be manufactured by the host side. We believe they will
                        eventually accept the <gloss target="#t_SLIFER_1">SLIFERs</gloss> but we may
                        have to compromise somewhat on the latter point by permitting the Soviets to
                        manufacture some of the less critical components.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Observers below 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1"
                            >KT</gloss>.</hi> In our view the verifying side must retain the right
                        to decide whether observers are needed. The draft treaty states that
                        observers should be permitted for any <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        event (including groups) with a total yield above 50 <gloss target="#t_KT_1"
                            >KT</gloss>. This requirement is rather extreme and could result in
                        excessive and unnecessary verification activities. In the working paper it
                        is acknowledged that observers are really only needed for <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> with yields in excess of 100 <gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> and the draft <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1"
                            >NSDM</gloss> instructs the Delegation to take this position.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Observers for <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> groups
                            above 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>.</hi> The draft treaty
                        provides for extensive observer activities including utilization of both
                        seismic instruments and <gloss target="#t_SLIFER_1">SLIFERs</gloss> for all
                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> groups with aggregate yields above
                        150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Information Exchange.</hi> The draft treaty includes
                        provisions for information exchange which are graduated on the basis of the

                            <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> Compliance.</hi> The draft treaty
                        includes an article reaffirming compliance with the <gloss
                            target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>, which the Soviets indicated they would
                        be willing to accept. Whether or not exceptions are permitted, however, we
                        can expect strong criticism on the implications for the <gloss
                            target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> of permitting excavation <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1"
                            >NSDM</gloss> would have the delegation continue to stress that we
                        expect the Soviets to comply with the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>
                        and to ensure that the negotiating record is clear on that point. This will
                        enable us to state, during our ratification hearings, that we have put the
                        Soviets on notice that we will expect adherence to the <gloss
                            target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> in all <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> activities.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Cooperation.</hi> The draft treaty contains an article
                        which provides for consultation between the Parties and for possible
                        agreements on cooperation in <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>. The
                        Soviets have consistently insisted on a cooperation provision and at one
                        point suggested the entire <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> agreement
                        should be an agreement on cooperation. The draft treaty position is a
                        minimal one and the Soviets may insist on a more explicit agreement on
                        cooperation in certain aspects of <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        development.</p>
                    <p>Most of the provisions reflected in the draft treaty are fairly close to the
                        Soviet positions as we know them and we anticipate only minor difficulties
                        in resolving the remaining differences. However, we may be misreading the
                        Soviets on some of these issues such as observer rights or cooperation.
                        Furthermore, the Soviets may attempt to link resolution of some of these
                        issues to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> acceptance of at least some
                        exceptions over 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>. Consequently, it is
                        too early to predict how much time will be required to reach an
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation</p>
                    <p>The attached <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> and draft treaty are
                        fully consistent with our private note in May and effectively implement the
                        withheld provisions of the last <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss>. In addition, there is substantial
                        bureaucratic concurrence on these issues. Accordingly, we believe that there
                        is no need for further Presidential review at this time and we recommend
                        that you sign the attached <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> at Tab A.
                        We will subsequently prepare a memorandum from you to the President

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Nuclear Suppliers’ Conference</p>
                    <p>We are scheduled to have the third multilateral meeting of the seven key
                        nuclear suppliers in London on September 16–17. The purpose of this meeting
                        is to agree on the basic principles for safeguards and controls associated
                        with nuclear exports, commission a working group to work out the details of
                        the understandings, and consider ways to expand the group to include other
                        potential future suppliers.</p>
                    <p>The analysis of the options for our position at the Suppliers’ Conference is
                        at Tab C, and our positions and fallbacks—as recommended by all agencies—are
                        embodied in the delegation instructions at Tab A.</p>
                    <p>The agreement we foresee as now achievable is less than we would desire in

                    <p>—Bilateral consultation provisions on specific export cases to areas where
                        there is risk of instability.</p>
                    <p>In view of the comprehensiveness of the above provisions and their general
                        support by all participants, and comparing our current expectations with the
                        state of play last fall where we had no knowledge of French attitudes toward
                        nonproliferation or even their willingness to apply any kind of safeguards,
                        we view even this agreement as a significant accomplishment. However, there
                        will probably be considerable criticism that there are no mandatory controls
                        which would bar export of reprocessing and enrichment technology to
                        sensitive areas or at least require continuing supplier involvement in the
                        operation of such plants. In particular, the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                            >FRG</gloss>-Brazil deal would be permitted under this agreement and
                        bilateral supply of reprocessing technology such as the French arrangements
                        with South Korea and Pakistan could go forward. This is a serious problem
                        since public awareness of the Supplier discussions has generated
                        expectations that the Suppliers will agree to measures which would prohibit
                        or severely constrain such exports.</p>
                    <p>The only alternative to this type of agreement would be to back off from our
                        compromises in the first two meetings and insist on much stronger controls
                        such as <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards on all nuclear
                        facilities in recipient countries; mandatory supplier involvement with
                        multinational participation in reprocessing or enrichment plants and
                        prohibitions on supply of such technology to sensitive areas. There would be
                        support from most of the other Suppliers for some or all of these measures
                        and we could probably isolate the French and Germans on these issues.
                        However, we do not have much leverage with either country on the basis of
                        our peaceful nuclear exports and it is unlikely that we could accomplish
                        such a fundamental change in their positions.</p>
                    <p>We do have some leverage with the French in that they have asked us for some
                        relief on three bilateral issues: liberalization of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> policy on nuclear reactor exports;
                        relaxation of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> licensing requirements on
                        French licenses of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> firms; and
                        relaxation of our policy of requiring the return of uranium tails when the
                        Soviets provide toll enrichment services. However, we promised to be
                        sympathetic to these requests in securing French agreement to participate in
                        the Suppliers talks and to some extent they will consider <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> movement in these issues as a quid pro quo
                        for their attendance.</p>
                    <p>A possible additional source of leverage—which you might be able to use in
                        your channel—is our special nuclear assistance relationship <pb n="530"
                            facs="0564" xml:id="pg_530"/>with the French. The President has
                        committed himself to <persName corresp="#p_GDV_1">Giscard</persName> on much
                        of this assistance, however, and any attempt to use it as leverage would
                        constitute a major reversal of this policy. Another problem with a tough
                        approach is that we assured the French at the outset of the Suppliers talks
                        that we were sympathetic with their concerns and would not isolate them in
                        these proceedings. Thus, an attempt to take a “high road” at this time would
                        suffer from a lack of leverage, would be inconsistent with previous
                        assurances, and could result in a collapse of the Suppliers’ talks.
                        Therefore, we strongly recommend that you authorize us to continue with our
                        present approach and make the few additional compromises that may be
                        required to reach an agreement.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">French Bilaterals</p>
                    <p>We will meet with the French in Paris on September 10 to discuss the
                        bilateral concerns as a prelude to the September 16–17 Nuclear Suppliers
                        Conference. We are still hopeful that we may get some French movement on two
                        outstanding issues: mandatory participation of the Supplier in management of
                        any exported enrichment and reprocessing facilities, and standard provisions
                        requiring Supplier consent for reprocessing, storage or alteration of
                        weapons usable material (plutonium and highly enriched uranium) derived from
                        supplied materials or facilities. It must be pointed out, however, that we
                        do not know whether, or to what extent, a favorable <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> response on these three bilateral issues would actually
                        cause France to modify her stance in the Suppliers negotiations. Further, a
                        favorable <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> response on the bilateral
                        issues could create difficulties for the Administration with respect to
                        Congressional reactions, particularly when the extent of the proposed French
                        sale to the Soviets becomes known to the Congress (6 to 12 power
                        reactors).</p>

                        modified our policy of requiring <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>
                        safeguards on such sales so that we now require them only where there is a
                        substantial risk of diversion of fissionable materials—a criteria which
                        effectively excludes the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> from a
                        safeguards requirement. (In the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> case,
                        we did however require that the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> obtain
                        a peaceful uses assurance on the transfer and that the Soviets should supply
                        the uranium ore to be used for fuel.) Since the safeguards requirement was a
                        major stumbling block for <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> approval
                        of reactor sales to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in the past,
                        the change would probably be accepted by France as substantially meeting
                        their first request. However, waiving this requirement does <pb n="531"
                            facs="0565" xml:id="pg_531"/>not represent blanket approval for future
                        export requests. These requests must still be reviewed in <gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> in order to assure that other
                        strategic interests (such as sensitive technology and information) are
                        protected.</p>
                    <p>There is interagency disagreement on our response to the French on this
                        issue. State and <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> would be prepared to
                        discuss our position on the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> reactor

                        would avoid such discussions for fear of misleading the French into assuming
                        a favorable <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> attitude toward these
                        sales.</p>
                    <p>We recommend that the French be told, as we already have conveyed to the
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>, that the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> will not require as a condition of our <gloss

                        because our study of the strategic implications of the transfer of this

                    <p>—Indicate to the French the policy shift represented by the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> decision on the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                            >FRG</gloss> reactor sale but emphasize that the strategic implication
                        of future sales must still be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.</p>
                    <p>—Present the compromise on the tails issue already authorized by <gloss
                            target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 275.</p>
                    <p>—Assure the French that we will not use licensing arrangements to block
                        reactor sales we have already authorized in <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1"
                            >COCOM</gloss> and offer to explore whether there is a way to eliminate
                        the licensing provision and replace it with a government-to-government
                        agreement.</p>
                    <pb n="533" facs="0567" xml:id="pg_533"/>
                    <p>Under this approach we will be able to show substantial accommodation of the
                        French on the first two issues. Our recommendations on these two issues are
                        somewhat more forthcoming than the official positions of <gloss
                            target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1"
                        >ERDA</gloss>. However, their major concern is with the licensing issue, and
                        on this point, the draft instruction would only authorize an expression of
                        willingness to consider compromise arrangements and not commit us to
                        specific changes in licensing requirements.</p>

                    <p>That you authorize us to continue our present approach in the Suppliers’

                    <p>The following instructions have been approved for the negotiations on
                        underground nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes (<gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>) which will resume in Moscow on September
                        5, 1975. These instructions supplement those contained in <gloss
                            target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 297.</p>
                    <pb n="534" facs="0568" xml:id="pg_534"/>
                    <p>1. The Delegation should state that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        prefers a 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> limit on all individual
                        excavation <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> and, in this context, would
                        be willing to accept a one megaton limit on the aggregate yield of all
                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> salvos. The Delegation should cite
                        the following factors as contributing to this preference:</p>
                    <p>(a) There would be no need to distinguish between excavation and contained
                        PNEs;</p>
                    <p>(b) The necessity for stringent verification provisions for excavation <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> would be lessened; in particular, there
                        would be no need for a fission yield restriction and its attendant melt
                        sample collection;</p>
                    <p>(c) The public and international acceptance of both the Threshold Test Ban
                        Treaty (TTBT) and the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> agreement would
                        be enhanced if all individual <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> were
                        subject to the TTBT yield restriction.</p>
                    <p>2. For <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> events with yields above 100
                            <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>, observers should be permitted as
                        needed at the discretion of the side verifying the explosion and observers
                        should be permitted for all <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> groups with
                        aggregate yields above 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>3. To augment verification of individual <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        yields, the Delegation should propose the use of <gloss target="#t_SLIFER_1"
                            >SLIFERs</gloss> for all <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> groups
                        with aggregate yields above 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>4. The Delegation should continue to reiterate our position that all <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> must be fully consistent with existing
                        treaty obligations, including the Limited Test Ban Treaty (<gloss
                            target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>). In addition, it should state that
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> studies indicate that it does not
                        appear to be possible to carry out major <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> excavation projects without violating the <gloss
                            target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss>. In this regard, the Delegation should
                        avoid technical discussions of such matters as differences in interpretation
                        of the <gloss target="#t_LTBT_1">LTBT</gloss> or de minimus radiation
                        standards.</p>
                    <p>5. The Delegation is authorized at an appropriate time upon approval by
                        Washington to table on an ad referendum basis the draft <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> treaty prepared by the Verification Panel

                    <p>2. Explosions addressed in paragraph 1 of the present article are carried out

                        measures. Letter lists agreements attesting to progress already achieved in

                        systematically being increased”.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DTD_1">Davies</persName> October 24 to convey
                        Soviet thinking on recent Soviet disarmament initiatives. During
                        conversation, he gave particular emphasis to ban on development and
                        deployment of new weapons of mass destruction.</p>
                    <p>2. Turning to Soviet proposal to ban new weapons of mass destruction,
                            <persName corresp="#p_IV_1">Israelyan</persName> stated following.
                        Soviets have as many questions about the “terrible” weapons ban as
                        Americans. In spite of these questions, the Soviet proposal was very serious
                        and not propaganda. In all frankness it had to be admitted that the Soviets
                        had tried to define and enumerate specific types of new weapons subject to
                        ban but had failed. He and others had asked Soviet scientists and
                        academicians to ascertain what concrete types of new weapons could emerge in
                        future years. The scientists had stated that it was impossible to predict
                        what specific types would emerge. It was certain, however, that new types of
                        weapons would come forth.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_IV_1">Israelyan</persName> continued that the Soviet
                        proposal had two aspects: (a) banning new types of systems, and (b) banning
                        new systems. New types of systems are those that differ from existing
                        weapons. The identity of these new types of weapons had to be defined. (<hi
                            rend="italic">Comment:</hi> These new types presumably would include
                        weapons based on new physical principles. <persName corresp="#p_IV_1"
                            >Israelyan</persName>’s comment indicated that scope of the Soviet
                        proposal had not been defined.)</p>
                    <p>New systems of weapons are new generations of existing weapons, such as those
                        of a chemical and nuclear type. Examples of new systems are <gloss
                            target="#t_B1_1">B–1</gloss>, Trident, and binary gases. It is
                        necessary, of course, to define what constitutes a “system.” Soviets,
                        however, are ready to discuss restraints on new systems of all parties.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_IV_1">Israelyan</persName> said that questions related
                        to this matter could not be discussed in the General Assembly since it
                        touched on complex and even secret matters. It could, however, be discussed
                        on an “expert” level, either among a small group or bilaterally. (<hi
                            rend="italic">Comment:</hi> In a later remark, Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_IV_1">Israelyan</persName> stated that he was referring
                        primarily to discussions at the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, though
                        bilateral discussions outside the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> could
                        not be excluded.)</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_IV_1">Israelyan</persName> said that Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName> had made it clear that
                        while the “terrible” weapons ban proposal was “most difficult and delicate,”
                        it had one key virtue—it did not challenge anyone. It is interesting to note
                        that, in spite of “the tremendous hostility” of the Chinese toward the
                        Soviet Union as manifested again during Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s visit to Peking, the Chinese
                        had not attacked “terrible” weapons ban. This contrasted with Chinese
                        attacks on other Soviet disarmament proposals. (<hi rend="italic"
                            >Comment:</hi>
                        <persName corresp="#p_IV_1">Israelyan</persName> was markedly emotional in
                        his reference to Chinese hostility. Chinese have, in fact, denigrated
                        “terrible” weapons ban.)</p>
                    <p>5. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IV_1">Israelyan</persName> said that,
                        while the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> may have dozens of questions
                        on the “terrible” weapons ban, the Soviets had hundreds. Discussions might
                        take one, two, five or even ten years. Nevertheless, they are eminently
                        desirable.</p>
                    <p>6. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IV_1">Israelyan</persName> stated that
                        disarmament was becoming an increasingly important issue at the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>. Trends, however, were not favorable for the
                        “big powers” such as the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. The negative trends were obvious at the
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> RevCon where the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss> were the target of criticism by the developing countries.
                        The results of the RevCon would have been worse if the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> and
                        the Soviets had not consulted and planned in advance. At the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, in spite of our better relations,
                        delegations do not closely coordinate. While there is little possibility for
                        joint action on political matters such as the Middle East, Korea and
                        decolonization, in the sphere of disarmament we can basically agree on all
                        issues other than the world disarmament conference. <persName
                            corresp="#p_IV_1">Israelyan</persName> said what was needed is a joint
                        active, parallel approach to lead the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                        discussion. A defensive, passive stance, as the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> delegation has maintained in recent years will lead only
                        to resolutions that “make no sense.” Typical of such possible resolutions
                        are the Mexican proposal (to reduce great power strategic arms as more
                        members adhere to the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>). It would be a
                        “shame” if the United States abstained on a question like this.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IV_1">Israelyan</persName> stated that
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> consultations could include the
                        Soviet Union, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, and the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>. France could be asked, even though it is
                        not a “big power” and would probably not be interested.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_DTD_1">Davies</persName> stated that he would
                        discuss the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> consultation suggestion with
                        the appropriate American officials.</p>
                    <pb n="541" facs="0575" xml:id="pg_541"/>
                    <p>7. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IV_1">Israelyan</persName> suggested
                        that, in addition to <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> consultations, it
                        might be useful to conduct regular Soviet-American arms control
                        consultations. The British agreed to such consultations during Prime
                        Minister Wilson’s visit in February. The first two-day meeting was held in
                        July and was a “great success.” Similar consultations are also held with the
                        Italians. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IV_1">Israelyan</persName>
                        indicated that he intended to suggest to his government establishment of
                        such Soviet-American consultations.</p>
                    <p>8. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_DTD_1">Davies</persName> asked for <persName
                            corresp="#p_IV_1">Israelyan</persName>’s assessment of the TTBT/PNE
                        talks. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IV_1">Israelyan</persName> stated
                        that when he left Moscow in August, his Deputy <persName corresp="#p_TRM_1"
                            >Timerbayev</persName> had said everything would be settled by the end
                        of September. A few days ago, <persName corresp="#p_TRM_1"
                            >Timerbayev</persName> had sent a letter saying that the talks are not
                        nearly completed.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_DTD_1">Davies</persName> indicated that the
                        principal problems in the talks were verification and the observer
                        function.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IV_1">Israelyan</persName> said these are
                        very difficult problems.</p>
                    <p>There are many agencies involved. He indicated that if the American
                        bureaucratic situation is bad, the Soviet situation is no better. (<hi

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IV_1">Israelyan</persName> said that the
                        importance of <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> seemed to be growing,
                        especially in view of the energy crisis. Soviets are very enthusiastic about
                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>. Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_IV_1">Israelyan</persName> said that Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MID_1">Morokhov</persName> (Soviet TTBT/PNE negotiator and
                        Deputy Chief of State Committee on Atomic Energy) had provided a briefing on
                        the benefits of <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>. <persName
                            corresp="#p_IV_1">Israelyan</persName> said that he was “very impressed
                        by the way <persName corresp="#p_MID_1">Morokhov</persName> explained the
                        utility of <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>.”</p>
                    <p>9. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_DTD_1">Davies</persName> thanked Ambassador

                    </list>
                    <p>We have been engaged for over a year in negotiations in Moscow to develop an
                        agreement governing the conduct of peaceful nuclear explosions (<gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>). A separate agreement on <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> is called for in Article III of the
                        Threshold Test Ban Treaty (TTBT) and was necessitated by strong Soviet
                        insistence during the July 1974 Summit that <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> yields should be allowed to exceed the 150 <gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> limit of the TTBT.</p>
                    <p>From the outset, this has been the outstanding issue in these negotiations.
                        We have strongly opposed any <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> above 150
                            <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> and the Soviets have been equally
                        firm in asserting that they must have such exceptions. In spite of this
                        impasse, considerable progress has been made in resolving differences in
                        verification provisions, observer rights and developing a joint draft
                        text.</p>
                    <p>The fourth round of these talks ended on October 31 and just prior to its
                        conclusion the Soviets made two important concessions which bring us closer
                        to an agreement:</p>
                    <p>—They accepted our method of yield verification, an electrical instrument
                        called <gloss target="#t_SLIFER_1">SLIFER</gloss>. (This device consists of
                        a long coaxial cable running from a recorder at the surface down to the
                        nuclear explosive. As the shock wave moves out from the explosion, the cable
                        is progressively crushed and by recording the shortening of its length with
                        time, the yield can be estimated within 20–30 percent accuracy, far better
                        than for seismic instruments.) The remaining problems concern differences on
                        issues such as custody of the equipment and aggregate yield limits on <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> salvos which should be resolvable.</p>
                    <p>—They also softened their position on having exceptions above 150 <gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>. They now say that they would need only
                        three such events per year and have suggested that special verification
                        measures for such <pb n="543" facs="0577" xml:id="pg_543"/>shots could be
                        negotiated on a case by case basis in the Joint <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> Commission, which we have agreed to establish. Under this
                        arrangement, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would effectively have
                        a veto right if the verification issues could not be resolved to our
                        satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>In addition to this movement on the exceptions issue in Moscow, <persName
                            corresp="#p_MID_1">Morokhov</persName>, (the Soviet Delegation Chairman)
                        in a private conversation with John Kelly alongside the last nuclear
                        suppliers’ meeting in London, stated that the entire Kama-Pechora Canal
                        project could be carried out within the 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1"
                            >KT</gloss> limit and that it would be at least three years before they
                        would need any exceptions.</p>
                    <p>Based on our <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> experience, there is little
                        economic loss in restricting all <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> to a
                        150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> yield limit and, given their recent
                        concessions, there appears to be some chance that the Soviets will simply
                        drop this issue in order to achieve an agreement that is otherwise favorable
                        to them in several respects, particularly in providing for <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet cooperation in <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>. This would give us an agreement that for
                        the first time would provide for on-site inspection, would be consistent
                        with the Threshold Test Ban and should be acceptable to Congress.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, if the Soviets persist on the exceptions issue, <persName
                            corresp="#p_MID_1">Morokhov</persName>’s statements suggest that we may
                        be able to reach a compromise that would exclude any exceptions for the next
                        five years (our proposed treaty duration, as in the <gloss target="#t_TTB_1"
                            >TTB</gloss>), but would leave open the possibility of events above 150
                            <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> in the future provided that the Joint
                        Commission could agree on the need for these shots and develop adequate
                        verification measures. This approach would cause <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1"
                            >ACDA</gloss> some concern, but would be acceptable to the other
                        agencies and probably to Congress as well.</p>
                    <p>In view of the March 31, 1976 effective date of the TTBT, we need to begin
                        our ratification effort with Congress early next year and the <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> agreement must be ready by that time. (We
                        have told the Soviets that we will not ratify the TTBT until a <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> agreement is concluded.) Even if we reach
                        agreement soon on the exceptions issue, several weeks would be needed to
                        clean up the remaining details and complete the agreement.</p>
                    <p>In an effort to move the talks along, it may be desirable to press the
                        Soviets on the exceptions issue by sending a private note stressing the lack
                        of current economic need for <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> above 150
                            <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> and arguing the advantages, in terms
                        of both domestic and international acceptance, of an agreement without
                        exceptions. Given the recent softening of their position, the Soviets might
                        be receptive to this argument. Alternatively, they might respond along the
                        lines of <persName corresp="#p_MID_1">Morokhov</persName>’s comments in
                        London which would open the way to an acceptable compromise as discussed
                        above.</p>
                    <p>There is some risk, however, that the Soviets would interpret any activation
                        of the back channel at this time as a sign of anxiety and <pb n="544"
                            facs="0578" xml:id="pg_544"/>toughen their position. In this regard, the
                        Soviets might argue that the present note does not differ materially from
                        the one we sent them in June and that they had made all possible concessions
                        in their response.</p>
                    <p>Another concern is that the Soviets, having learned their “linkage lessons”
                        only too well, may reject this initiative on grounds somewhat similar to
                        those in their recent <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> action—arguing
                        that they made important concessions in the last exchange and that it is our
                        turn to compromise. On the other hand they may be quite willing to move
                        ahead in non-<gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> arms control areas at
                        this time.</p>
                    <p>We will review this issue in the context of this week’s sessions in Moscow
                        and provide our recommendations in a subsequent memorandum.</p>

                        <item>United States Compliance with the Biological Weapons Convention</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The deadline for compliance with Article II of the Biological Weapons
                        Convention is December 26, 1975. In order to comply the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> must destroy or convert to peaceful
                        purposes all biological agents, toxins, and weapons not permitted by the
                        Convention. In addition, steps must be taken to ensure that the future
                        activities of the federal departments and agencies comply with the
                        Convention.</p>
                    <p>Under the terms of the Convention, the parties undertake not to develop,
                        produce, stockpile, or otherwise acquire or retain: (1) biological agents or
                        toxins of types and in quantities which have no justification for
                        prophylactic, protective, or other peaceful purposes, or (2) weapons <pb
                            n="545" facs="0579" xml:id="pg_545"/>or means for delivering such agents
                        for hostile purposes or in armed conflict.</p>
                    <p>Compliance therefore requires that (1) more precise guidelines be provided
                        government agencies regarding the “prophylactic, protective, or other
                        peaceful purposes” justified but not spelled out by the Convention, and (2)
                        ensuring that all activities involving the use of these materials are
                        consistent with the justifiable purposes and that all such materials on hand
                        are committed solely to these activities.</p>
                    <p>An agreed detailed interagency enumeration of the activities to be permitted
                        under the peaceful purposes clause has been developed. Judgments as to which
                        types and quantities are appropriate to a specific project must be made on a
                        case-by-case basis. Assurance should therefore be sought from government
                        agencies that all such materials held by them are reserved for the
                        justifiable purposes and that no other use is intended.</p>
                    <p>The question of federal legislation concerning application of the Convention
                        to activities of state and local governments and private citizens is being
                        separately considered by the interested agencies.</p>
                    <p>It is recommended that the President approve for the guidance of <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government agencies the enumeration of
                        peaceful purposes attached at Tab 1 and ask the heads of the pertinent
                        departments or agencies to certify to him prior to December 26 that (1) all
                        their departmental activities which retain any biological agents or toxins
                        are being conducted only for the permitted peaceful purposes, (2) the total
                        quantities of biological agents or toxins held are committed or reserved
                        solely to such peaceful activities, and (3) any weapons, equipment, or means
                        of delivery designed to use biological agents or toxins for hostile purposes
                        or in armed conflict have been destroyed or diverted to peaceful purposes,
                        in compliance with the Convention. (Suggested draft letter is attached at
                        Tab 2.)</p>
                    <p>The letter and the responding departmental certifications would suffice to

                    <p>1. On December 23 Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1"
                            >Hartman</persName> called in Soviet Minister Counselor <persName
                            corresp="#p_VY_1">Vorontsov</persName> and gave him the following note
                        verbale:</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Begin quote.</hi> The Secretary of State presents his
                        compliments to His Excellency the Ambassador of the Union of Soviet
                        Socialist Republics and has the honor to remind him of the continuing
                        importance attached by the Government of the United States to the full
                        compliance by the <pb n="548" facs="0582" xml:id="pg_548"/>Government of the
                        Soviet Union with the provisions of the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests
                        in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water, signed at Moscow on
                        August 5, 1963.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, the Government of the United States wishes to call to the
                        attention of the Government of the Soviet Union the collection by the
                        Government of the United States outside the borders of the Soviet Union of
                        radioactive debris directly associated with the Soviet nuclear explosions of
                        August 23, October 18 and October 21, 1975. The Government of the United
                        States is deeply concerned by these occurrences, which are inconsistent with
                        the terms of the 1963 Treaty of Moscow.</p>
                    <p>The United States Government has on a number of occasions since 1963
                        communicated to the Government of the Soviet Union its views concerning 19
                        previous nuclear explosions by the Soviet Union which have similarly caused
                        radioactive debris to be present in the atmosphere outside the territory of
                        the Soviet Union. As recently as March 12, 1975, the Soviet Union orally
                        replied to the latest United States communication on this subject, the note
                        verbale of January 16, 1975 and stated, “appropriate Soviet authorities were
                        and are taking the measures directed at the fulfillment of the requirements
                        of the stated treaty.” On June 6, 1975, the United States Government
                        informed the Government of the Soviet Union that this oral Soviet response
                        did not offer sufficient reassurance. To this, the Government of the Soviet
                        Union replied on July 7, 1975 that nothing would be added to the Soviet
                        reply of March 12, 1975.</p>
                    <p>The United States Government expects that the Government of the Soviet Union,
                        as an original party to the Moscow Treaty, will succeed in fulfilling these
                        treaty requirements. The United States Government is of the view that full
                        compliance with the terms of the 1963 Treaty of Moscow by all parties is of
                        vital importance, not only for preserving the integrity and effectiveness of
                        this treaty but also for the development between the Governments of the
                        United States and of the Soviet Union of the mutual confidence necessary to
                        ensure the success of future efforts to regulate nuclear explosions. The
                        Government of the United States assumes that the Government of the Soviet
                        Union fully shares this view. <hi rend="italic">End quote.</hi>

                        <item>Conclusion of the Nuclear Suppliers Agreement</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>After several meetings of the seven major nuclear supplier nations,
                        substantial agreement has been reached on common safeguards guidelines for
                        nuclear exports. The effect of these guidelines will be to lessen the threat
                        of nuclear weapon proliferation. The key provisions of the guidelines
                        are:</p>
                    <p>1. Recipients must assure suppliers that no export will be used in any
                        nuclear explosive device.</p>
                    <p>2. Recipients will provide adequate physical protection so that nuclear
                        material or facilities are protected against seizure or sabotage.</p>
                    <p>3. All nuclear exports, as delineated in a specific trigger list, will be
                        under <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards.</p>
                    <p>4. Any facility indigenously replicated from imported sensitive technology,
                        such as enrichment or reprocessing plants, will be safeguarded.</p>
                    <p>5. Recipients cannot reexport equipment or technology without safeguards, or,
                        in the case of sensitive technology, without agreement of the originating
                        country.</p>
                    <p>These and other more detailed provisions are encompassed in the package at
                        Tab B. State has sent this to you for information purposes (Tab A), noting
                        that agreement to these common guidelines for safeguards and control on
                        nuclear exports was achieved pursuant to the President’s instructions (Tab
                        C). The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is prepared to inform others of
                        its intention to abide by the guidelines. This action will not constitute an
                        international agreement but rather an embodiment of common policies adopted
                        on the political level by each of the participants.</p>
                    <pb n="550" facs="0584" xml:id="pg_550"/>
                    <p>Adherence by the seven suppliers to these guidelines is the culmination of
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> initiative to reach a concerted
                        nuclear export policy with the other major nuclear suppliers. It is intended
                        that the number of participating countries will increase as more countries
                        become suppliers, and the agreement calls for consultations and future
                        meetings for the purpose of considering even stronger safeguard
                        measures.</p>
                    <p>The suppliers agreement will not solve the problem of nuclear proliferation,
                        nor would it prevent transfers of especially sensitive technology as in the
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>/Brazil agreement; however, it
                        should considerably broaden the applications of <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1"
                            >IAEA</gloss> safeguards. In addition, there is clear evidence that as a
                        result of the suppliers discussions both France and the <gloss
                            target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> have become increasingly sensitized to the
                        problem of nuclear proliferation. In particular, France has reportedly made
                        a policy decision not to export chemical reprocessing technology in the
                        future, apparently including a reversal of their planned sale to Korea.</p>

                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: You know, Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, the Disarmament Committee in
                        Geneva seems to be working very sluggishly. Maybe we should give it an
                        injection of some sort. The Committee has before it certain new questions to
                        discuss, notably the question we first raised at the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                            >UN</gloss> General Assembly. There was an appropriate resolution passed
                        and now it goes to the Disarmament Committee, that is the limitation of new
                        weapons systems. We know you take a cautious attitude. In fact you even
                        start looking a bit bored when I discuss that subject. But we think it
                        should be discussed.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No, I’m confused whether
                        you mean that no state can develop weapons beyond what it has developed or
                        that no state can develop weapons beyond what we have developed. So we have
                        difficulty giving instructions to our delegation.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: Then let us discuss that
                        matter in the Committee and/or parallel with the work of the
                        Committee—bilateral discussion of the matter to discuss various points. But
                        we can’t say that because we take a dim view we can’t discuss it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Perhaps our Ambassador
                        here could discuss it here with someone you delegate, to get further
                        clarification.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: We wouldn’t want the
                        exchange to take the form only of questions addressed to us. We would like
                        perhaps not only to take questions but also to put them.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That is very appropriate.
                        Why don’t we have discussions here in Moscow?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: All right.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You went three explosions
                        a year beyond 150 kilotons. And we believe that would make verification
                        impossible. Not to speak of ratification.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>: What is your proposal?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Our view is to take this
                        up at the review conference in five years. Our understanding is you have no
                        particular use for it now but just don’t want to foreclose the long-term
                        future.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We should both keep an

                        and for a possible 20% Iranian investment in the private <gloss

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Status of Negotiations with Iran</p>
                    <p>As detailed in ACTION–7742, our negotiations with Iran have faltered on two
                        points:</p>
                    <p>—Whether Iran would be allowed to stockpile large quantities of its surplus
                            <gloss target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss> fuel in Iran, or whether we would
                        hold the stockpile here to insure that Iran did not transfer that fuel to
                        unacceptable third countries.</p>
                    <p>—Whether the spent fuel coming out of the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> supplied reactors could be reprocessed in Iran. Based on
                        our policy to discourage the proliferation of independent national
                        reprocessing facilities, we have told Iran that we would approve such
                        reprocessing only if the plant were <hi rend="italic">multinationally</hi>
                        owned and operated. We would accept, as a minimum commitment, a <hi
                            rend="italic">binational</hi> plant, if a company of one of the major
                            <pb n="554" facs="0588" xml:id="pg_554"/>nuclear supplier nations,
                        including ourselves, was the partner with Iran.</p>
                    <p>Since our last negotiating session, the head of the Iranian <gloss
                            target="#t_AEC_1">AEC</gloss> has told us that not only are the above
                        conditions unacceptable, but that the Shah has, as a matter of principle,
                        indicated his unwillingness to accept any restraints that go beyond his
                        obligations as a Non-Proliferation Treaty party. In other words, Iran should
                        be free to reprocess and retain <hi rend="italic">plutonium</hi> in any
                        amounts it chooses, as long as <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>
                        safeguards are applied.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Current <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        Non-Proliferation Policy</p>
                    <p>The two essential features of our non-proliferation policy, <hi rend="italic"
                            >which all agencies support</hi>, are to guarantee that all nuclear
                        facilities supplied by the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> are under
                        international safeguards, and to control the spread of independent national
                        reprocessing facilities. Reprocessing facilities are difficult to safeguard
                        (see below) and provide any nation with ready access to weapons-useable
                        plutonium. Our main idea is to keep access to plutonium limited to a few
                        states, and those states should either be weapons states or highly stable
                        politically.</p>
                    <p>We cannot, however, deny reactor owners the ability to reprocess their fuel
                        and to use the recovered plutonium for refueling. Therefore, it has been our
                        position that reprocessing services—when they are needed on a world-wide
                        basis 10 to 20 years from now—should be provided at a few sites spotted
                        around the world; e.g., <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, Japan, Iran,
                        and Europe. The plutonium, mixed with uranium, would be returned to the
                        reactor owner as new fuel rods only when they are needed for refueling. This
                        arrangement would satisfy many states who simply want reprocessing services
                        to be available on a commercial basis. However, there are other countries
                        who may feel that they want to be <hi rend="italic">involved</hi>
                        technically and financially in all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle. (This
                        desire has led to certain states becoming investors in the 3 or 4 <hi
                            rend="italic">enrichment</hi> plants that are planned or under
                        construction.) In order to satisfy the same desire with regard to <hi
                            rend="italic">reprocessing,</hi> the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> and others have proposed that when the large reprocessing
                        facilities are finally needed, there should be an opportunity for other
                        countries—besides the host country—to be investors and play a role in the
                        management and operation of such plants. This is the multinational region
                        fuel center concept now under study in the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1"
                            >IAEA</gloss> and within our government. Such multinational facilities
                        have an added non-proliferation advantage since foreign participation tends
                        to make it more difficult for the host country to carry out a program of
                        undetected clandestine diversion, and would be an inhibiting factor in
                        considering the abrogation of safeguard agreements and expropriation of a
                        plant and its plutonium stockpile.</p>
                    <p>Our non-proliferation position has been developed over the past
                        year-and-a-half, and was the subject of three <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1"
                            >NSSMs</gloss> and two <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDMs</gloss>. <pb
                            n="555" facs="0589" xml:id="pg_555"/>(Contrary to the implication in
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJM_1">Cannon</persName>’s memorandum (Tab A), all
                        agencies support it strongly. This includes State, Defense, <gloss
                            target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss>,
                        and <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>.) Besides our suppliers conference
                        agreement, we have had two recent successes of our policy. Korea has agreed
                        to cancel its national reprocessing plant, and intelligence sources indicate
                        that <persName corresp="#p_GDV_1">Giscard</persName> has placed a moratorium
                        on further French exports of reprocessing technology. This latter is
                        particularly satisfying since France has been the slowest to appreciate the
                        proliferation dangers in international nuclear commerce.</p>
                    <p>Finally, some people contend that the application of safeguards is adequate
                        protection in reprocessing plants, and we need not try to deny access to
                        reprocessing technology. However, safeguards were devised to protect
                        reactors and have <hi rend="italic">never</hi> been applied on a large scale
                        to a reprocessing facility. There are many experts that are dubious that
                        safeguards can be effectively applied to reprocessing plants and that the
                        risk of sizeable undetected diversion of plutonium is a real concern. This
                        is another factor motivating our policy to control the spread of
                        reprocessing plants, until we can gain some knowledge by trying out the
                        safeguards in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> reprocessing plants that
                        are coming on line.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">What We are Trying to Accomplish in Iran</p>
                    <p>Iran is considered to be a possible site for a regional multinational
                        reprocessing center for the Middle East. This position is not devoid of risk
                        since Iran appears stable only by comparison with its neighbors, and its
                        political complexion could change overnight. However, all of the agencies
                        agree that we should be prepared to accept Iran as a potential reprocessing
                        site, with the caveat that the facility should, as a minimum, be co-owned
                        and co-managed by at least one of the major supplier nations. There is a
                        possibility (or hope) that since Iran’s need, and certainly its neighbors
                        needs, for reprocessing will not develop for at least 10 years, and in the
                        meantime reprocessing services may be available elsewhere on an attractive
                        basis, that Iran may choose not to exercise the option of constructing a
                        multinational facility within its own boundaries. On the other hand,
                        regardless of the economics, Iran might choose to go ahead for reasons of
                        prestige.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Current Proposal for Further Negotiations with
                        Iran</p>
                    <p>All agencies now agree that (if Iran will restrict its reexports to countries
                        with which we have agreements for cooperation) the risk connected with
                        permitting Iran to stockpile low enrichment uranium is acceptable, and the
                        proposed decision memorandum would permit our negotiators to offer that
                        concession at an appropriate time in the negotiations. All agencies also
                        agree that we need to ascertain as clearly as possible the Shah’s views on
                        these nuclear issues, and that we should explain to the Shah the reasons for
                        wanting to control the spread of <pb n="556" facs="0590" xml:id="pg_556"
                        />independent national reprocessing facilities. It is hoped that such a
                        dialogue would either remove his objection to our position, or possibly lead
                        to another alternative which would be mutually acceptable.</p>
                    <p>We have received indications from Tehran that they want to hold further
                        discussions, and we are therefore pushing to get the decision approved
                        sanctioning a high-level meeting with the Shah. Both HAK and <persName
                            corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName> have made the point recently that
                        this unresolved nuclear issue is having a souring effect on other aspects of
                        our relations with Iran, and they would like to see quick action.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>In trying to forward this package to the President, we have run up against
                        some objections on the part of the Domestic Council and <persName

                            corresp="#p_CJM_1">Jim Cannon</persName>’s views are expressed in a
                        memorandum at Tab A, but I have not been exposed to <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE_2">Connor</persName>’s position. I must say, frankly,
                        that neither of them have been involved in our work on non-proliferation or
                        the Iran negotiations, so their views in this matter will necessarily be
                        limited and quite possibly overly influenced by the nuclear industry
                        view—particularly that of <gloss target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss> who has been
                        in fairly constant contact with <persName corresp="#p_CJE_2"

                        Assurance Act. The general thrust of their objection is that our attitude
                        toward reprocessing is unrealistic and inhibiting to the conclusions of
                        Iran’s commitment to <gloss target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss>, which is vital to
                        the successful achievement of private enrichment and reprocessing in the

                            >UNGA</gloss> in September; we have just concluded an agreement between
                        major suppliers to discourage national reprocessing plants and to encourage
                        a few multinational facilities; and finally, the Administration witnesses

                            >Fri</persName>) are appearing today to testify on S. 1439 to reiterate
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy toward international
                        reprocessing. We are not free to fall off this policy on the whim of two
                        people in the White House.</p>
                    <p>One theme that <persName corresp="#p_CJM_1">Cannon</persName> may stress is
                        that since the multinational concept is only now under study, we cannot
                        expect <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> business interests or Iran to
                        commit to an arrangement when it is so undefined and possibly impractical.
                        We agree. But no such commitment is needed now or for many years to
                        come—during which time the concept may be proven feasible or not. If a few
                        multinational plants are not workable, we would then probably have to fall
                        back to permitting reprocessing only in certain national plants in the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, Europe and Japan. It is because of
                        uncertainties like this and others that we want to avoid an unqualified
                        agreement that would permit reprocessing in Iran. We want to retain a right
                        of future approval so that we can cope with unforeseen events.</p>

                    <p>It is the view of the agencies that an Iranian agreement for cooperation
                        which contains <hi rend="italic">no</hi> special control on reprocessing
                        would be disapproved by Congress, and the President would be criticized as
                        being irresponsible in nuclear matters. Since the prospect for obtaining
                        reactor business in Iran, and a <gloss target="#t_UEA_1">UEA</gloss>
                        investment, depends on obtaining congressional approval of an agreement,

                        than fighting us.</p>
                    <p>Also involved in this issue is the broader question of the extent to which
                        foreign policy should be shaped by domestic considerations, and you may want
                        to address this problem.</p>

                    <p>The President has reviewed the study of November 20, 1975, regarding the
                        negotiation of a nuclear agreement with Iran, and has noted the comments and
                        recommendations provided by the addressees.</p>

                    <p>The President is anxious to see negotiations of the civilian nuclear accord
                        resumed with Iran under terms that will clearly foster <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> nonproliferation interests, promote <gloss

                        nuclear objectives, and stand a good chance of mutual acceptance. He also
                        believes any moves taken by the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to
                        accommodate Iranian concerns should be taken in the light of a clear
                        perception of Iran’s principal problems with past <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> proposals as well as a clear understanding as to whether
                        Iran still desires to transact much of its nuclear business with the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> if a nuclear agreement can be
                        concluded.</p>
                    <p>The President has noted the range of possible modifications to the current
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> position that ultimately might
                        prove necessary to reach an agreement based on the above objectives. He has,
                        however, decided to reserve his judgment as to the final position that the
                        United States should take on the substance of the proposed agreement, while
                        approving the proposal that the State Department and <gloss
                            target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss> should promptly send a high-level team
                        to Tehran. This team should seek to clarify the Shah’s concerns with the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> position and to expose the Shah and
                        others (1) to the reasons for the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        interests in discouraging the establishment of completely national
                        reprocessing facilities in Iran and other countries, and (2) to the
                        technical and economic factors which militate against a near-term decision
                        to reprocess in Iran. The talks would be exploratory in character during
                        which the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> team would endeavor to induce
                        Iran to join with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> in an act of
                        leadership designed to discourage the spread of independent national
                        reprocessing facilities. In this regard, we would favor a commitment to the
                        multinational concept but would be prepared to explore with Iran other
                        techniques for achieving the same objective.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> representatives are authorized to
                        inform Iranian officials whenever they deem appropriate that the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would allow Iran to receive and store,
                        under effective safeguards, all of its entitled share of the low enriched
                        uranium that it might purchase through investment in a <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> facility. Retransfer of this material
                        would be restricted to those countries with which the United States has an
                        appropriate agreement for cooperation.</p>
                    <p>Following these high-level talks, and any further discussions required to
                        sharpen our understanding of Iran’s position, a report should be submitted
                        to the President describing those alternate approaches which would be
                        consistent with our objective of avoiding the spread of national
                        reprocessing facilities while permitting us to reach an agreement on nuclear
                        cooperation with Iran. The implications of these alternatives should be
                        assessed in light of our non-proliferation and other objectives, and the
                        prospects for congressional approval. The report should include agency
                        recommendations.</p>
                    <p>In light of the extensive analysis that has already been carried out, there
                        should be little delay in the preparation of this report, for the <pb
                            n="559" facs="0593" xml:id="pg_559"/>President wishes to avoid any long
                        hiatus between the discussions with the Shah and the resumption of detailed
                        negotiations.</p>
                    <p>The President wants efforts to continue on a timely basis in assembling the
                        technical and economic data needed to evaluate the multinational
                        reprocessing concept. In this connection, he believes that the efforts
                        underway to develop our domestic reprocessing industry will provide an
                        important source of information and he expects the evaluation of the
                        multinational concept to draw upon that information. He wants it understood
                        that our efforts to deter proliferation by promoting the multinational
                        concept in our international negotiations should in no way restrict our
                        domestic policy with respect to reprocessing or the way we develop our
                        domestic industry.</p>

                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_MJJ_1">Martin</persName> also proposed that <gloss

                        its procedures during 1976, suggesting that this be carried out in a series
                        of informal meetings. He said if review led to decisions on changes in
                        procedures, it would be desirable to codify all procedures in a single set
                        of rules. In proposing review, <persName corresp="#p_MJJ_1"
                            >Martin</persName> emphasized unique role of <gloss target="#t_CCD_1"
                            >CCD</gloss> as multilateral disarmament forum and need to assure that
                        any changes genuinely contribute to committee’s effectiveness.</p>

                            >USSR</gloss>’s 1975 <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> resolution
                        calling on <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> to negotiate convention to
                        prohibit development of new weapons of mass destruction (<gloss
                            target="#t_MDW_1">MDW</gloss>) and reviewed provisions of Soviet draft
                        convention. He noted need to define specific categories of weapons to be
                        banned, stating Soviet readiness to take part in detailed examination of
                        question during <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> negotiations. He said
                        consideration of <gloss target="#t_MDW_1">MDW</gloss> issues would require
                        holding informal meetings with experts in which Soviet experts would
                        participate.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_RAA_2">Roshchin</persName> also reviewed Soviet
                        proposal at 1975 <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> for a treaty on
                        general and complete prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests. He maintained that
                        all nuclear-weapon states must participate in such a treaty, rejecting
                        proposals calling only on some <gloss target="#t_NWS_1">NWS</gloss> to
                        declare a moratorium or suspend tests. Such proposals, he said, create
                        unilateral advantages for some states, violate principle that disarmament
                        agreements must not diminish anyone’s security, and therefore “are clearly
                        doomed to failure.” <persName corresp="#p_RAA_2">Roshchin</persName> also
                        argued that verification of a test ban should be based on national technical
                        means supplemented by exchange of seismic data. Recalling that <gloss
                            target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> resolution envisaged establishment of
                        new body for negotiation of general test ban, <persName corresp="#p_RAA_2"
                            >Roshchin</persName> said <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> should
                        continue its own work on subject in order to “facilitate progress.”</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_RAA_2">Roshchin</persName> referred briefly to
                        environmental modification, emphasizing desirability of banning hostile use
                        of <gloss target="#t_EnMod_1">EnMod</gloss> techniques before they become
                        militarily feasible. He expressed hope that <gloss target="#t_CCD_1"
                            >CCD</gloss> would examine and conclude convention and submit it to 1976
                            <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_GRA_1">Garcia Robles</persName> (Mexico) reviewed in

                        also noted establishment of ad hoc committee to review disarmament role of

                        order to accelerate pace of its work, saying that “if the committee is
                        interested in preserving its existence” it should not report to the 1976
                            <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> “empty-handed.” <persName
                            corresp="#p_GRA_1">Garcia Robles</persName> called on <gloss

                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> attaches to that organization as a means
                        of preventing the diversion of nuclear materials and the proliferation of
                        nuclear weapons capability.</p>
                    <p>2. Whether to absorb the $1 million needed for 1977 within the current budget
                        request for contributions to international organizations or to seek a budget
                        amendment for an additional $1 million.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">BACKGROUND</p>
                    <p>Concern is growing in the Congress and the public about the potential
                        diversion of nuclear materials from commercial nuclear power programs as
                        more nations acquire nuclear power facilities. This concern is being
                        expressed in congressional hearings and in proposed legislation that would
                        sharply limit <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> exports of nuclear
                        materials and technology. Such unilateral action would be ineffective,
                        however, since several <pb n="565" facs="0599" xml:id="pg_565"/>other
                        nations now have nuclear materials export capabilities. Thus, the problem
                        can only be resolved multilaterally.</p>
                    <p>Under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1"
                            >IAEA</gloss> oversees the accounting of nuclear materials in signatory
                        nations to detect diversion. However, the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1"
                            >IAEA</gloss> task is becoming increasingly formidable as more nations
                        utilize nuclear energy. <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>’s current
                        safeguards budget is not sufficient to meet growing needs for inspectors and
                        to deal with new issues of physical security and monitoring.</p>

                        the next five years to provide more training of inspection personnel, more
                        research and development of improved data and techniques, the services of
                        expert consultants and specialized equipment. Other countries would also be

                    <p>If you approve the proposal, <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss> recommends
                        that the $1 million 1977 requirement be financed by reprogramming within the
                        $178 million foreign aid appropriation for voluntary contributions to
                        international organizations. <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss> believes
                        that a small $1 million amendment to the sizeable 1977 foreign aid budget
                        request is not appropriate especially in view of the restrictive 1977 budget
                        policy. This would not preclude seeking a special $5 million <hi
                            rend="italic">authorization</hi>, not appropriation, for this new
                        initiative, if it were determined advisable to seek specific congressional
                        support for the proposal. Subsequent 1978 and later appropriations could be
                        included in the budgets for those years as necessary.</p>
                    <p>The State Department believes an amendment seeking $1 million additional for
                        1977 is necessary. If the $1 million were to be absorbed, it would probably
                        have to come from our proposed $100 million pledge to the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Development Program, which has much more
                        support from developing countries than <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1"
                            >IAEA</gloss> safeguards activity. Furthermore, the <pb n="566"
                            facs="0600" xml:id="pg_566"/>Department believes that a request for an
                        additional amount is needed to make this new initiative credible in the
                        Congress and to achieve more visibility for your non-proliferation position.
                        The Senate has already passed a $1 million 1976 appropriation authorization
                        for this purpose, indicating some Congressional support for increased
                        funding.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">DECISION</p>

                    <p>There will be a meeting of the Verification Panel on Friday, March 5, at 9:30

                        Issues</p>
                    <p>The Soviets recently accepted our long-standing position that all individual
                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> must be restricted to a maximum
                        yield of 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> under the <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> Treaty. This effectively revises the
                        “ground rules” under which these negotiations were begun in the summer of
                        1974, and represents a major Soviet concession. In addition, there is clear
                        agreement that observers will be permitted for <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> salvos with aggregate yields greater than 150 <gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>. As a result, the two sides are considerably
                        closer to an agreement, and this memorandum proposes new instructions on the
                        remaining issues in an effort to bring the talks to a speedy conclusion. In
                        view of the March 31, 1976 effective date of the TTBT, there is considerable
                        urgency in this effort.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_VPWG_1">VPWG</gloss> on Test Bans has completed an
                        analysis of these issues (Tab C) and, after extensive lobbying, a near
                        consensus has been reached on a new position on the most important issues,
                        which should facilitate our reaching an agreement. There are tactical
                        differences on how far we should move initially in two of the remaining
                        issues, but there is general agreement on the flexibility that we have on
                        each issue. Some of the agencies may back away somewhat in the <gloss
                            target="#t_VP_1">VP</gloss> meeting from the <gloss target="#t_VPWG_1"
                            >VPWG</gloss> consensus and argue for no movement at all at this time,
                        preferring to wait for further Soviet concessions. It is clear, however,
                        that we have accomplished our two major objectives—no individual <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> above 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1"
                            >KT</gloss> and observers for large <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        salvos. As a result we should move quickly to conclude the agreement, giving
                        ground where necessary on the remaining issues.</p>
                    <p>The chart at Tab B provides a useful précis of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss>, Soviet and intermediate positions on each of the major
                        outstanding issues. The proposed position taken in the draft <gloss
                            target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> attached to this memorandum is
                        highlighted on this chart. There are 24 other issues according to the
                        Delegation’s latest count (their summary cable is at Tab E), but most of
                        these can probably be resolved through backstopping once we break the log
                        jam on the major issues.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Duration of the Agreement.</hi> Our present position is
                        that the duration of the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> agreement
                        should be five years, as in the TTBT, with a strong linkage between the
                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> verification provisions and the
                            <gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss> threshold. The Soviets prefer a
                        15-year duration and have tried to decouple the treaties as much as
                        possible. All agencies agree that we could accept a compromise position of a
                        15-year duration with a strong, explicit linkage to the TTBT and a provision
                        for review at five-year <pb n="568" facs="0602" xml:id="pg_568"/>intervals.
                            <gloss target="#t_OSD_1">OSD</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_JCS_1"
                            >JCS</gloss>, however, would prefer that this be authorized only as a
                        fall back at a later point.</p>
                    <p>The intermediate position is much closer to our present stance than the
                        Soviet position and it seems unlikely that we would accomplish much with
                        such a concession. Therefore, I recommend that we accept the Defense
                        position on this issue to gain leverage in going to their fall back on the
                        other tactical issue they have raised, the aggregate yield limit.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Observers Below 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1"
                            >KT</gloss>.</hi> The two sides agree that to reduce uncertainties it
                        would be useful to permit observers for individual <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNEs</gloss> in the 100–150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> yield
                        range; however, the Soviets insist that this should be at the discretion of
                        the side carrying out the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>, while we
                        argue that this should be an absolute right of the verifying side. All
                        agencies would prefer that we maintain our present position. There was
                        little support for raising the threshold to 125 <gloss target="#t_KT_1"
                            >KT</gloss> for these observers since at that level, the Soviets could
                        effectively preclude observer participation by only slightly misstating the
                        planned <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> yield—e.g., 124 instead of 150
                            <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> [<hi rend="italic">1 line not
                            declassified</hi>]. Surprisingly, most agencies would prefer to drop the
                        requirement altogether rather than move to 125 <gloss target="#t_KT_1"
                            >KT</gloss>.</p>

                                target="#t_SLIFER_1">SLIFER</gloss>).</hi> This is a controversial
                        issue that has led to considerable irritation on the part of our Delegation,
                        since it appears that we will have to back away from an ad referendum
                        agreement they had achieved on the basis of earlier guidance. This
                        controversy reflects the uncertainties in utilizing newly developed
                        equipment such as the <gloss target="#t_SLIFER_1">SLIFER</gloss>, for which
                        relatively little data are available, in a geologically different and
                        somewhat hostile environment.</p>
                    <p>The issue arises from the fact that in addition to gathering yield data,
                            <gloss target="#t_SLIFER_1">SLIFER</gloss> also can acquire
                        electro-magnetic pulse (EMP) data that can reveal details of device design.
                        Consequently, while accepting <gloss target="#t_SLIFER_1">SLIFER</gloss> as
                        the basic tool for on-site <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> yield
                        measurement, the Soviets have endeavored to keep the end of the <gloss
                            target="#t_SLIFER_1">SLIFER</gloss> cable as far away from their nuclear
                        device as possible. Curiously, this doesn’t really eliminate the EMP data,
                        although it does degrade the <gloss target="#t_SLIFER_1">SLIFER</gloss>
                        accuracy.</p>
                    <p>After extensive discussion, the two sides reached agreement, on an ad
                        referendum basis, on a formula that related the distance of the end of the
                            <gloss target="#t_SLIFER_1">SLIFER</gloss> from the bottom of the device
                        canister to the planned yield of the device. (This distance would be 3.5W<hi
                            rend="superscript">1/3</hi> meters below 20 <gloss target="#t_KT_1"
                            >KT</gloss> and 3W<hi rend="superscript">1/3</hi> above that level,
                        where W is the yield in <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>.) This formula
                        was actually somewhat better than the one we had authorized at the time. The
                            <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss> laboratories thoroughly examined
                        the ad referendum agreement, however, and found that some of their earlier
                        projections were inaccurate. As a result, <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1"
                            >ERDA</gloss>, supported by Defense, asked <pb n="569" facs="0603"
                            xml:id="pg_569"/>that we inform the Delegation that their ad referendum
                        agreement was unacceptable. They proposed an entirely new formulation in its
                        place which would shorten the canister as a function of yield for yields
                        below 50 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> and keep the end of the <gloss
                            target="#t_SLIFER_1">SLIFER</gloss> cable a constant distance of one
                        meter above the top of the canister.</p>
                    <p>We asked the Delegation for its views on such a proposal and they were
                        alarmed, noting that the <gloss target="#t_SLIFER_1">SLIFER</gloss> would be
                        much closer to the higher yield devices than with the ad referendum
                        agreement. In addition, this might cause the Soviets to reinstate their
                        request for a switch on the <gloss target="#t_SLIFER_1">SLIFER</gloss> cable
                        to eliminate the EMP signal. <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss> had been
                        quite concerned that the switch either might not work or would be highly
                        susceptible to “bugging.” On the other hand, at lower yields, the <gloss
                            target="#t_SLIFER_1">SLIFER</gloss> would be somewhat further away with
                        the <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss> approach, since with the ad
                        referendum agreement, the <gloss target="#t_SLIFER_1">SLIFER</gloss> cable
                        actually would overlap a standard 10 meter canister for lower yields.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> feels strongly (and this is my
                        personal view) that no modification to the ad referendum agreement is needed
                        since the cheating scenarios at low individual <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> yields are so implausible. For example, in one cheating
                        scenario, the Soviets would announce a 400–500 <gloss target="#t_KT_1"
                            >KT</gloss> salvo involving 20–30 devices with announced yields of about
                        20 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> which would all actually yield less
                        than 5–10 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>. This might produce enough

                        record about a 400 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> salvo). However, such
                        a collateral event would have a significant risk of detection through
                        on-site monitoring activity or through satellite photography and, since the
                        experiment would have to be hidden beneath other shots, it would be
                        difficult to get good diagnostics from the test. In addition, the Soviets
                        would have to explain how such a large number of proven <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> devices had simultaneously failed. (We
                        have agreed the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> device development must
                        be done at the weapons test site.) Another factor is that the TTBT
                        uncertainty is such that one could test at the weapons test site at almost
                        the same yield with considerably less risk of detection and far better
                        diagnostics.</p>

                            >ERDA</gloss> laboratories. They tend to look at each technique in

                        somewhat distant from an announced project. It can only detect the cavity

                        would prevent them from accomplishing this goal and that a 60–90 day

                        during the next few weeks, there will be pressures to extend the effective

                        to abandon the TTB/PNE agreements altogether.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> has pointed out that the Vienna
                        Convention on the Law of Treaties requires that once we have signed a
                        treaty, we must abide by its provisions until ratification is completed. The
                        situation is complicated by the fact that the Vienna Convention itself is
                        not yet in force although we have apparently been acting in accordance with
                        its provisions. In addition, we do not know how the Soviets plan to
                        interpret this Convention prior to its entry into force.</p>
                    <p>It seems clear, however, that while the Vienna Convention may have some
                        effect if a <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> Agreement has been signed,
                        it should probably be ignored altogether if we have not concluded a <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> Agreement by March 31. Article III of the
                        TTBT calls for conclusion of such an agreement, and we could not consider
                        ourselves bound by the TTBT if the other side is free to conduct weapons
                        tests in the guise of <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_VPWG_1">VPWG</gloss> paper contains two sets of options
                        corresponding to whether a <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> Agreement
                        has or has not been concluded. In the first case, with both agreements in
                        hand, the obvious course would be to reach agreement with the Soviets that
                        both sides will fully comply with the TTB/PNE provisions pending exchange of
                        instruments of ratification. This would include going ahead with data
                        exchange and observers, if large <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> are
                        carried out during this period. If the Soviets balked at the <gloss

                    <p>It appears likely that most of the agencies would agree with the above

                        more difficult, however. In this case our actions would obviously be

                        reflected in the attached draft <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss>. You
                        should stress that the Delegation is experiencing serious morale problems
                        and that it is in everyone’s interest to conclude the agreement as quickly
                        as possible, now that we have accomplished our primary objective. The
                        discussion on the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> issues should be
                        aimed at quickly affirming the consensus on each issue in order to avoid
                        digression into lengthy discussion of cheating scenarios. In short, the
                        desired consensus would reaffirm our position on the duration and “observers
                        below 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>” issues, but authorize a higher
                        aggregate yield limit of 1500 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> and high
                        seismic network threshold of 500 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> in
                        return for Soviet acceptance of our modified <gloss target="#t_SLIFER_1"
                            >SLIFER</gloss> spacing rule.</p>
                    <p>You should then discuss the ratification issues, noting that the issue would
                        be much easier to handle if we are able to quickly complete the <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> Agreement. In conclusion you might
                        encourage everyone to work as cooperatively as possible in order to resolve
                        the other <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> issues through the

                            >U.S.</gloss>), recalling four general issues identified in opening
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> statement Feb 17, offered more
                        detailed exposition of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> views on
                        prohibition of military or any other hostile use of environmental
                        modification (<gloss target="#t_EnMod_1">EnMod</gloss>) techniques.</p>
                    <p>2. Concerning scope of draft convention submitted by <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, <persName
                            corresp="#p_MJJ_1">Martin</persName> said definition of prohibited
                        activities effectively eliminated danger of hostile use of <gloss
                            target="#t_EnMod_1">EnMod</gloss> techniques that could significantly
                        affect another state party while avoiding difficulties of implementation
                        that would be involved if effort were made to deal with essentially trivial
                        issues. He noted that in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> view some
                        hostile uses of <gloss target="#t_EnMod_1">EnMod</gloss> techniques would be
                        prohibited altogether, such as generation of earthquakes and tsunamis,
                        climate modification, and steering or intensification of hurricanes, which
                        would inevitably have widespread, long-lasting, or severe effects.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_MJJ_1">Martin</persName> said that convention would
                        prohibit hostile use of techniques involving deliberate manipulation of
                        natural forces as a weapon, noting that convention was not concerned with
                        damage to environment incidental to use of conventional means of
                        warfare.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MJJ_1">Martin</persName> recalled suggestion made at
                            <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> that convention prohibit threat
                        of use as well as actual hostile use of <gloss target="#t_EnMod_1"
                            >EnMod</gloss> techniques. He said this could, in <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> view, raise difficulties of implementation
                        disproportionate to potential benefits. While expressing doubt that
                        prohibition of threat would add an important element to basic prohibition,
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJJ_1">Martin</persName> said <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> was prepared to hear further explanation
                        of idea.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_MJJ_1">Martin</persName> said <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> recognized importance of providing
                        adequate assurance of compliance with convention, saying that twin
                        procedures set out in draft—provisions for cooperation and consultation as
                        well as complaints procedure to <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Security
                        Council—satisfactorily meet this need.</p>
                    <p>6. With respect to relation between <gloss target="#t_EnMod_1">EnMod</gloss>
                        convention and Laws of War Protocol, <persName corresp="#p_MJJ_1"
                            >Martin</persName> emphasized important differences between the two,
                        arguing that differences of provision and terminology were appropriate in
                        view of different objectives and coverage.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_MJJ_1">Martin</persName> stressed <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> view that <gloss target="#t_EnMod_1"
                            >EnMod</gloss> convention should not seek to deal with questions of
                        peaceful uses of <gloss target="#t_EnMod_1">EnMod</gloss> techniques.
                        Recalling suggestion that convention include positive commitment concerning
                        cooperation in promotion of peaceful uses, <persName corresp="#p_MJJ_1"
                            >Martin</persName> said that in view of largely unproven benefits of
                        peaceful application <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> did not consider
                        such a commitment prudent. He noted, however, that all <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        <pb n="575" facs="0609" xml:id="pg_575"/>
                        <gloss target="#t_EnMod_1">EnMod</gloss> research is being carried out on
                        unclassified basis and said there was no desire on <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> part not to share technical information.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_MJJ_1">Martin</persName> again encouraged other dels
                        to join in discussion of <gloss target="#t_EnMod_1">EnMod</gloss> convention
                        issues in order to further effort to develop widely acceptable text.</p>
                    <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_EC_1">Ene</persName> (Romania) gave standard
                        statement calling on <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> to organize its
                        work on basis of priorities established by <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1"
                            >UNGA</gloss>. He said Romania considered particularly important the
                        reappraisal of the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss>’s tasks and duties
                        in accordance with <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> resolution on
                        Disarmament Decade. He also reviewed main points of Romanian position paper
                        on disarmament issues circulated at General Assembly.</p>
                    <p>10. At end of meeting, chairman of day read proposal by co-chairmen that
                        committee hold informal meeting on organization of work, including format of

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: This appearance could be
                        a nightmare. I will need people sitting near me who have quick answers to
                        these questions. Is <persName corresp="#p_RAA_1">Ribicoff</persName> going
                        to be hostile?</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_MRJ_2">McCloskey</persName>: I don’t think so.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What is the bill that I
                        am testifying on?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KMB_1">Kratzer</persName>: The bill is S–1439 which
                        would change the procedures for export licensing with respect to nuclear
                        exports and give more control of the process to the Nuclear Regulatory
                        Commission (<gloss target="#t_NRC_1">NRC</gloss>).</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What is the <gloss
                            target="#t_NRC_1">NRC</gloss> arrangement?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KMB_1">Kratzer</persName>: <gloss target="#t_NRC_1"
                            >NRC</gloss> is independent of the Executive Branch. This bill would
                        raise problems in our ability to carry out nuclear exports.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What are the constraints
                        in the bill?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KMB_1">Kratzer</persName>: The <gloss
                            target="#t_NRC_1">NRC</gloss> was set up when the old <gloss
                            target="#t_AEC_1">AEC</gloss> was divided. <gloss target="#t_NRC_1"
                            >NRC</gloss> decides whether or not export licenses can be issued. Under
                        the bill, <gloss target="#t_NRC_1">NRC</gloss> could either decide to issue
                        or deny an export license, or to take no action at all but refer the matter
                        to Congress for sixty days for a congressional decision. This means they
                        would buck the difficult cases to the <persName corresp="#p_HRC_1"
                            >Hill</persName>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I suppose the <gloss
                            target="#t_NRC_1">NRC</gloss> would have no problem on licensing exports
                        to Canada but would send the prickly problems to Congress.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KMB_1">Kratzer</persName>: That’s right, and this
                        would undermine confidence in the capability of the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> as a reliable supplier. The bill would also require <gloss
                            target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> to provide a nuclear proliferation
                        impact statement on every export case. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1"
                            >Ingersoll</persName> testified against the bill as have all of the

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Who else is on the

                    <p>Sonnenfeldt: <persName corresp="#p_JHM_1">Jackson</persName> is but he will
                        probably still be in Florida.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: <persName

                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KMB_1">Kratzer</persName>: We’ve drafted your
                        statement so that you can start on general policy rather than particular
                        pieces of the bill.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The more passionate I am
                        on the evils of nuclear proliferation, the more the Committee will become
                        attached to their bill. I am going to confront <persName corresp="#p_RAA_1"
                            >Ribicoff</persName> if he is going to kick me on détente. What does he
                        want us to do with Europe?</p>
                    <pb n="577" facs="0611" xml:id="pg_577"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KMB_1">Kratzer</persName>: The Committee is pushing us
                        to cut off nuclear fuel supplies to the allies, and to any other possible
                        proliferator.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What about a country like
                        South Africa?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KMB_1">Kratzer</persName>: South Africa has its own
                        uranium. It has a small pilot enrichment plant. The Senators want us to use
                        leverage on the other suppliers of equipment. The Senators think we can use
                        our position as a major supplier of enriched uranium, but that is a position
                        that will diminish by 1980.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Why should we not use our
                        leverage until then?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KMB_1">Kratzer</persName>: It would be a disaster to
                        our position as a reliable supplier.</p>
                    <p>Sonnenfeldt: It would mean the death knell for <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss> if we cut off fuel to our allies because their exports
                        don’t follow our standards.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KMB_1">Kratzer</persName>: The point is we have some
                        influence because of our position as a supplier.</p>
                    <p>Sonnenfeldt: It would be a supreme act of faith for us to join the Russians
                        in cutting off supplies to our allies. The Russians might agree, and once we
                        had done it, undertake to supplant us and exploit us against our <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> allies.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Then we should say that
                        we continue our supply of nuclear fuels in order to maintain our influence
                        in the proliferation field. Is this going to be a Donnybrook or not?</p>
                    <p>Sonnenfeldt: The Senators are not hostile but they are hepped on
                        proliferation.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: <persName
                            corresp="#p_GJ_1">Glenn</persName> is reasonable and I can deal with

                            >Ribicoff</persName> will probably run off the rails.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What have we agreed to

                        <persName corresp="#p_KMB_1">Kratzer</persName>: It’s in your briefing

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Who will take notes
                        tomorrow?</p>
                    <p>Sonnenfeldt: Kelly will.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">Vest</persName>: In the Suppliers’ Conference
                        we agreed to the application of <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>
                        safeguards on all nuclear exports by any of the suppliers.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName>: We can’t say we
                        agreed.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">Vest</persName>: That’s right. These are
                        unilateral statements of policy.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Is it an advance to get
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards on all exports?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">Vest</persName>: Yes, it is for France. Also,
                        we have safeguards on transferred technology.</p>
                    <p>Sonnenfeldt: Non-<gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> members will have to
                        take these safeguards.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Will I be asked about the

                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KMB_1">Kratzer</persName>: Yes, the query will be how
                        hard we tried to block it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We would have preferred
                        the regional reprocessing facility.</p>

                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KMB_1">Kratzer</persName>: Yes, the multilateral
                        regional approach involves more countries and makes it more difficult for a
                        country to abrogate the safeguards or to divert materials.</p>
                    <p>Sonnenfeldt: You will also be asked about the French/Pakistan deal. You
                        should sign out the package you have on that which calls for further
                        approaches to the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> and the French.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I haven’t seen any
                        package on Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">Vest</persName>: The suppliers’ guidelines also
                        call for a commitment by recipient countries not to use any materials for
                        explosives, whether military or peaceful. In the case of sensitive
                        facilities, safeguards will continue on any replicated technology.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Does the supplier have to
                        agree to the duplicate facilities in advance?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: One of the problems in the
                        suppliers’ effort was that we could not get a commitment from the others to
                        the multilateral regional approach.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName>: We can’t get any
                        commitment against the export of reprocessing or enrichment plants from the
                        French or the Germans.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Why?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KMB_1">Kratzer</persName>: I think they would argue
                        that if the suppliers do not export these facilities under safeguards, then
                        various countries will build them on their own entirely without safeguards.
                        Of course, one can argue how long it would take for various countries to
                        build indigenous plants. The Pakistanis are less capable; the Brazilians are
                        more capable.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Then I can say that the
                        export of reprocessing plants is not the only way that would-be
                        proliferators could obtain them.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KMB_1">Kratzer</persName>: That’s right. The
                        technology is in the public domain. There is a range of capabilities among
                        various countries. Japan has a reprocessing plant which is not safeguarded
                        itself, but is safeguarded when it is processing material that falls under
                        safeguards.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I have no question in my
                        mind that the world would be better off without reprocessing plants and
                        nuclear weapons. But that does not preclude a country from developing such
                        entirely on its own.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: Such developments are
                        tremendously destabilizing.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But we have no guarantee
                        that a single country cannot do this.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KMB_1">Kratzer</persName>: And we can’t convince
                        France and the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> of the merits of the
                        multilateral approach.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Why not?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KMB_1">Kratzer</persName>: Because no one has done
                        reprocessing successfully on a commercial scale.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>I welcome this opportunity to speak to you on the subject of nuclear
                        proliferation—one of the most urgent problems facing the United States and
                        the world community and one which will vitally affect the security of all
                        nations for the rest of this century.</p>
                    <p>As the committee is aware, your concerns over the dangers posed by further
                        nuclear proliferation are widely and deeply shared throughout the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government. To convey to you both the
                        seriousness with which we view this issue and the steps we are taking to
                        deal with the proliferation problem, I propose to address the following
                        questions in my statement:</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">First,</hi> how does nonproliferation fit into the
                        framework of our overall foreign policy?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Second,</hi> what multilateral efforts to deter
                        proliferation have already been initiated, and what further measures do we

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Third,</hi> what actions are we taking as a matter of

                        extend our international nonproliferation activities?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Fourth,</hi> how do we assess the longer term prospects
                        for containing further nuclear spread through an evolving diplomatic and
                        technical strategy?</p>
                    <pb n="580" facs="0614" xml:id="pg_580"/>
                    <p>Before turning to these broader aspects of nonproliferation, I should note
                        that I fully approve of the position on Senate bill 1439 set forth by Deputy
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName> before the
                        committee. For the reasons outlined during his January 30 appearance, we
                        cannot support this bill.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Nonproliferation Perspectives</p>
                    <p>Nonproliferation has been a primary foreign policy goal of the United States
                        through six Administrations, with major accomplishments stemming from <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> initiatives demonstrating the seriousness
                        with which this policy has been pursued. I cite, for example, the adoption
                        of bilateral safeguards and controls in our government-to-government
                        cooperative agreements, the establishment of the International Atomic Energy
                        Agency (<gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>) in Vienna, and the entering
                        into force of the nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. As a result of these
                        steps, the number of nuclear-weapon states has been substantially
                        limited.</p>
                    <p>After I assumed the office of Secretary of State, however, it became apparent
                        that changing circumstances warranted a new look at our nonproliferation
                        strategy:</p>
                    <p>—Other industrialized states were entering the international nuclear market,
                        thereby challenging our longstanding dominance as a commercial nuclear
                        exporter and threatening to diminish the ultimate effect of our national
                        safeguards and control policies.</p>
                    <p>—The oil crisis has stimulated many developing as well as developed states to
                        accelerate their peaceful nuclear power programs, both as a means of
                        lowering the cost of generating electrical energy and reducing their
                        reliance on imported petroleum products.</p>
                    <p>—The nuclear test by India underscored the fact that additional states, even
                        those not part of the highly industrialized world, were capable of using
                        nuclear technology to construct explosives.</p>
                    <p>In my speech to the U.N. General Assembly in September of 1974, I underscored
                        our concerns over the rapid spread of nuclear technology with potential
                        explosive implications. I chose this forum to address the pressing problem
                        of proliferation since it is clear that the danger of further
                        nuclear-explosive spread is a problem vital to every nation on this planet.
                        At that time, I warned against complacency by observing that:</p>
                    <quote>The world has grown so accustomed to the existence of nuclear weapons
                        that it assumes they will never be used. But today, technology is rapidly
                        expanding the number of nuclear weapons in the hands of major powers and
                        threatens to put nuclear-explosive technology at the disposal of an
                        increasing number of other countries.</quote>
                    <p>Let me emphasize that pursuit of a vigorous nonproliferation strategy remains
                        a fundamental dimension of this Administration’s overall foreign policy:</p>
                    <pb n="581" facs="0615" xml:id="pg_581"/>
                    <p>—We see the need to reduce the danger of nuclear war as the centerpiece of
                        our policy. If additional states acquired nuclear weapons, global stability
                        would be endangered, and regional conflicts would run the risk of leading to
                        nuclear war, with potentially catastrophic consequences not only for the
                        nations involved but for all major powers.</p>
                    <p>—We view the peaceful settlement of regional conflicts and a more stable
                        world order as crucial <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> objectives. Yet
                        a world of many nuclear powers would result in heightened political tensions
                        and increased instabilities flowing from fears that nuclear weapons might be
                        used, whether deliberately or through miscalculation.</p>
                    <p>—We support the worldwide goal of finding alternative sources of energy to
                        reduce reliance on oil. Yet a progressive pattern of proliferation could set
                        back, if not cripple entirely, the continued growth of peaceful nuclear
                        energy to serve mankind’s needs, as exporters and importers alike came to
                        lose confidence in the ability of the international system to find effective
                        techniques for realizing the peaceful benefits of nuclear energy while
                        eliminating its inherent security risks.</p>
                    <p>To meet these new dangers, I emphasized in my 1974 U.N. General Assembly
                        speech—and again a year later before the same forum—the importance the
                        United States attaches to nonproliferation. In both addresses, I outlined
                        practical steps we saw as necessary to move forward effectively and
                        comprehensively in this vital field. These included proposals for the major
                        suppliers to strengthen nuclear safeguards; efforts to gain the widest
                        possible support for the international safeguard system and the
                        Nonproliferation Treaty; physical security measures to protect nuclear
                        material against theft or diversion; and steps to prevent the unrestrained
                        spread of sensitive nuclear facilities, such as national reprocessing
                        plants.</p>
                    <p>I am pleased to take this opportunity to report to this committee on the
                        progress we have made and the problems we still face. There have been solid
                        accomplishments to date, and I will go into the details of these successes
                        in a few moments. But we are far from complacent, and even as we consolidate
                        our gains, we seek to strengthen our nonproliferation strategy.</p>
                    <p>I do not have to tell this committee how difficult it is to devise a strategy
                        that can guarantee success in preventing the number of nuclear-weapon states
                        from increasing during the coming decades. But I cannot emphasize too
                        strongly our belief that the effort can and must be made to contain nuclear
                        spread, even if we cannot be certain of completely and effectively blocking
                        additional nuclear proliferation.</p>
                    <p>It is within the foregoing framework that we have mounted a major effort
                        during the past two years to strengthen the worldwide nonproliferation
                        regime. This strategy has had two reinforcing elements:</p>
                    <pb n="582" facs="0616" xml:id="pg_582"/>
                    <p>—Multilateral actions to move forward with other states in meeting the
                        nonproliferation challenge; and</p>
                    <p>—National nuclear export policies to insure that the United States continues
                        to exert responsible leadership in nonproliferation.</p>
                    <p>Let me now describe in some detail the key elements of our nonproliferation
                        strategy, what has been accomplished during the past two years, and what
                        needs to be done to further advance our position.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Multilateral Strategy</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Suppliers Consultation.</hi> I have noted earlier that the
                        United States, practically speaking, does not have complete, unilateral
                        freedom of action with respect to its nuclear export policy. Other major
                        industrial powers have the capacity and desire to contribute to the world’s
                        needs for peaceful nuclear energy, and they fully recognize the need to
                        safeguard their assistance.</p>
                    <p>It is important, however, that safeguards not become an element of commercial
                        competition. <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> constraints by themselves
                        will have little effect if other nuclear suppliers decline to exercise the
                        same restraint. In recognition of this, we have pursued a policy of
                        consulting with other nuclear-exporting countries in an effort to devise a
                        common set of standards concerning safeguards and other related controls
                        associated with peaceful nuclear exports. I believe these efforts have met
                        with a significant degree of success.</p>
                    <p>As a result of these consultations, the United States has decided to adopt,
                        as a matter of national policy, certain principles which will govern our
                        future nuclear exports. We have been informed that a number of other
                        countries intend to do the same. As other Administration witnesses have
                        testified in recent weeks before another Senate committee, these principles

                        are needed to improve and extend these principles and that our efforts are
                        part of a progressive and evolving process which we will continue in close

                        element of our international nonproliferation strategy is our effort to
                        secure the widest possible adherence to the Nonproliferation Treaty.
                        Adherence to the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> is a key element in
                        prevention of nuclear proliferation because it involves a comprehensive
                        commitment by non-nuclear-weapon states not to develop nuclear explosives—a
                        commitment verified by <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards on
                        all peaceful nuclear facilities in that country—and also because it requires
                        safeguards on nuclear exports.</p>
                    <p>While <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> adherence is still far from
                        universal, nearly 100 states are now party to the treaty. The past 18 months
                        have seen a number of important new adherents, including the Federal
                        Republic of Germany, Italy, the Benelux countries, the Republic of Korea,
                        Libya, and Venezuela, as well as submission of the treaty by Japan, which
                        has already signed the treaty, to the Diet for ratification.</p>
                    <p>We must continue to do whatever we can to increase support for this most
                        important treaty in the hope that non-nuclear-weapon states who see the

                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> Safeguards.</hi> Another
                        essential feature of our international strategy—and, indeed, one that
                        underpins the progress we have made in consultations with other suppliers
                        and one that is basic to the Nonproliferation Treaty itself—is the
                        comprehensive safeguards system of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
                        Even in the case of recipient states not party to the <gloss

                            >IAEA</gloss> system provides internationally recognized safeguards
                        arrangements to insure that nuclear exports are used for peaceful
                        purposes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards entail techniques to
                        account for nuclear materials, reinforced by containment and surveillance
                        measures. Agency experts conduct on-site inspections to verify, through
                        independent means, that safeguarded material and facilities are being used
                        for declared purposes. These safeguards can provide a high degree of
                        assurance that any significant diversions will be detected and thus provide
                        a real deterrent.</p>
                    <p>While a safeguards system cannot provide absolute assurance that all
                        conceivable diversions, however modest, will be detected, it does not have
                        to. What it must do—and what the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>
                        accomplishes with confidence—is expose the would-be diverter to a high risk
                        of detection.</p>
                    <p>We recognize that some question the adequacy of the international controls
                        related to nuclear facilities and materials that have evolved <pb n="584"
                            facs="0618" xml:id="pg_584"/>over the years. However, in the one
                        instance where a nuclear device was exploded through the use of equipment
                        obtained from outside, safeguards did not exist on the facility or its
                        products. Consequently, the question of adequacy of safeguards in this case
                        simply did not arise. In fact, since the inception of safeguards, we know of
                        no nation that has acquired nuclear weapons through any diversion of nuclear
                        material subject to either bilateral or <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1"
                            >IAEA</gloss> safeguards.</p>
                    <p>We believe that the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> system—with the
                        active technical, financial, and political support of key suppliers and all
                        nations interested in using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes—will
                        continue to fulfill this requirement. Indeed, the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1"
                            >IAEA</gloss> safeguards system continues to be a most vital and
                        singularly important element in the battery of constraints developed over
                        the years in support of our nonproliferation objectives.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Sensitive Exports.</hi> Another element in our
                        international strategy is designed to meet what is perhaps the most
                        troublesome nonproliferation issue confronting us; namely, dealing with
                        sensitive technologies, such as reprocessing, enrichment, and heavy water
                        production. The problem has been made more acute as more countries become
                        interested in acquiring these sensitive facilities. In terms of
                        proliferation risks, plutonium-reprocessing plants abroad pose the most
                        immediate problem. This is unfortunate, since for most countries—those
                        without very large nuclear power programs—the economic benefits of
                        reprocessing spent fuel remain dubious.</p>
                    <p>As a result of growing perceptions of the direct proliferation risks,
                        suppliers as well as recipients appear to be exercising increasing restraint
                        in such sensitive areas and have concluded rigorous safeguards agreements.
                        In this regard, we greatly welcomed Korea’s decision not to acquire a
                        national reprocessing facility and hope that it will enhance multilateral
                        efforts to develop alternatives to national capabilities.</p>
                    <p>One course of action which might meet the future reprocessing needs of
                        certain countries in a potentially economic manner and at the same time
                        alleviate some of our concerns regarding the proliferation of such
                        facilities is the concept of a multinational fuel-cycle center serving
                        regional needs, to which I have given my personal support before the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> General Assembly last year.</p>
                    <p>Such plants—involving management, operation, and perhaps ownership by more
                        than one country—would reduce the incentive for small and inefficient
                        national plants and provide useful added assurances against unilateral
                        abrogation of nonproliferation undertakings, particularly if co-located with
                        other parts of the fuel cycle such as the fabrication and storage of nuclear
                        materials. They would also facilitate the application of international
                        safeguards. The <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> is currently carrying
                        out a study of the multinational concept.</p>

                        international nonproliferation strategy concerns the question of physical
                        security of nuclear facilities and materials and specifically the concern
                        that a subnational or terrorist group might seize nuclear materials.</p>
                    <p>We have received excellent cooperation in our consultations with other
                        countries designed to insure that adequate physical security measures are
                        applied. Major suppliers are including provisions in their nuclear
                        cooperation agreements which specifically require adequate levels of
                        physical security systems in recipient countries to protect nuclear
                        materials and equipment. Experts from member countries are assisting the
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> in developing an authoritative
                        body of knowledge on the establishment of effective national physical

                    <p>Also, we are pursuing our proposal of an international convention, setting
                        standards to protect the physical security of nuclear materials, that might

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Basic Premise.</hi> I have been discussing those
                        multilateral measures we are pursuing in support of our nonproliferation
                        objectives. <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> national policies and
                        practices in this area reflect our special concern with the problem of
                        nonproliferation and are, in some respects, more stringent than those of
                        some other supplier nations.</p>
                    <p>The basic premise of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> nuclear cooperation
                        for over 20 years has been worldwide cooperation in the peaceful uses of
                        nuclear energy under effective controls. Our approach has been to offer
                        long-term assurances of enriched uranium supply, accompanied by the
                        especially economical <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> reactor
                        technology, in exchange for agreement on effective safeguards
                        arrangements.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, as I testified before another committee of the Congress
                        last month in support of the Administration’s proposed Nuclear Fuel
                        Assurances Act, many of the positive advances we have made in pursuit of our
                        nonproliferation objectives can be traced directly to our capability and
                        willingness to furnish enriched uranium on a reliable and long-term basis,
                        along with other elements essential to peaceful nuclear development.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Policy Elements.</hi> As I observed earlier, our policies
                        with regard to nuclear exports are fully consistent with the principles
                        adopted as a result of supplier consultations and, in fact, in some areas go
                        beyond them. For example, in the areas of reprocessing, enrichment, and
                        heavy water production activities, our basic approach has been to avoid the
                        export of such sensitive technologies. To insure adequate control, the
                        executive branch instituted, in 1972, special regulations governing all
                        proposed transactions in these areas.</p>
                    <pb n="586" facs="0620" xml:id="pg_586"/>
                    <p>With regard to the general problem of reprocessing, the United States is
                        providing significant technical and financial support to the <gloss

                        concept of multinational regional fuel-cycle centers. We are also urging
                        that relevant groups of countries initiate discussions of the potential of
                        this concept among themselves.</p>
                    <p>In the area of international safeguards, I would note that in his most recent
                        energy message, the President outlined the Administration’s decision to make
                        special contributions of up to a total of $5 million in the next five years
                        to help strengthen the Agency’s safeguards program. We will, of course,
                        continue research programs and technical support activities aimed at
                        assisting the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> to develop more
                        effective safeguards procedures.</p>
                    <p>Pursuant to the physical security measures we have adopted as a result of
                        supplier consultations, the United States has adopted the policy that
                        significant quantities of sensitive nuclear materials will not be approved
                        for export unless adequate physical protection measures are applied in the
                        recipient countries, and <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> physical
                        security teams have visited numerous countries in this connection to observe

                        backdrop of the strategies that we are pursuing internationally and as a
                        matter of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> national policy, I believe it
                        appropriate that I respond to some of the critics of our nuclear export
                        policies who have called for what I believe to be overly severe constraints
                        which would seriously set back, rather than advance, our nonproliferation
                        efforts. These proposals range from a complete moratorium on our nuclear
                        exports, to an embargo on nuclear transfers to non-<gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                            >NPT</gloss> parties, to proposals to agree to nuclear exports to states
                        not party to the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> only if they have
                        accepted approved <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards on all
                        their peaceful nuclear programs.</p>
                    <p>In essence, it is our view that adoption of any of these proposals would, for
                        example:</p>
                    <p>—Violate the spirit, if not the letter, of a number of international
                        undertakings to cooperate in peaceful nuclear programs, including article IV
                        of the Nonproliferation Treaty;</p>
                    <p>—Damage our political relationships well beyond the nuclear area with a large
                        number of countries who have entered into long-term arrangements with
                        us;</p>
                    <p>—Cast further doubt on the credibility of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> supply commitments and the constancy of our policy at
                        precisely the moment when we can least afford such doubts;</p>
                    <p>—Reduce the influence we are now able to bring to bear in support of our
                        nonproliferation objectives inasmuch as it is unlikely that such proposals
                        will be supported by all major suppliers; and</p>

                    <p>—Might well result in the breakdown of supplier cooperation and a return to
                        relatively uncontrolled competition among other supplier countries.</p>
                    <p>I have commented negatively on these proposals, not because I question the
                        motivation and concern that underlie them but because I do not believe they
                        would achieve our nonproliferation objectives. The problems of proliferation
                        are complicated and not susceptible to quick and easy solutions.</p>
                    <p>To avoid the further spread of nuclear-weapon capabilities will require the
                        diligent pursuit of complex political and technical measures which minimize
                        the pressures for proliferation and, at the same time, erect effective
                        controls against it. This Administration is firmly committed to this
                        objective, and I know we can count on the Congress to work with us in
                        insuring we can achieve this vital goal.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Proliferation Prognosis</p>
                    <p>The arrangements I have described are designed to inhibit and detect any
                        diversion. There remains the question of measures that could be applied in
                        the event of a demonstrated diversion of nuclear material to nonpeaceful
                        purposes or other violations of a nonproliferation or safeguards
                        undertaking. This is a question of importance, since treaty assurances
                        against proliferation, even when backed by effective safeguards, could lose
                        much of their deterrent power if nations come to believe that violations of
                        such arrangements would not be viewed with seriousness by the international
                        community.</p>
                    <p>Under the Statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency, all further
                        peaceful nuclear assistance would be discontinued in the event a state
                        violated its <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards commitments.
                        If <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> nuclear material was involved, our
                        bilateral agreements call for halting further assistance. The <gloss
                            target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> Statute also provides for suspension of
                        membership in the Agency in the event of a violation and reporting to the
                        U.N. Security Council. In addition, both our bilateral agreements and the
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> Statute include the right to call
                        for the return of supplied materials and equipment.</p>
                    <p>These actions are substantial. The discontinuance of supply to a country
                        which has committed a major portion of its electrical energy generation to
                        nuclear energy is in itself a significant disincentive to any violation.
                        More generally, I can assure you that the United States would treat a
                        violation of one of its agreements with the utmost gravity. And I am
                        confident that the world community at large would view such an action with
                        comparable concern.</p>
                    <p>However, these considerations do not relieve us of the need to insure that we
                        have taken all available and practical preventive measures to forestall the
                        spread of nuclear weapons. To this end, as I have <pb n="588" facs="0622"
                            xml:id="pg_588"/>indicated, we have strengthened and standardized the
                        system of safeguards and controls in our national policies and through
                        multilateral initiatives; identified the improvements needed to further
                        diminish the likelihood that peaceful nuclear technology will be used to
                        build explosives; and established procedural and institutional arrangements
                        to enable us to consolidate our gains and move toward our future goals.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps most fundamentally, we recognize that proliferation is not a problem
                        to be addressed solely through the technical and legal framework of
                        safeguards and export controls—vital as these avenues may be. There is a
                        direct link, as I have stressed, between our efforts in nonproliferation and
                        our broader efforts to construct a more secure international climate.</p>
                    <p>If countries remain convinced that regional and global tensions can be
                        reduced through cooperation, that disputes can be resolved in a peaceful
                        manner, and that their legitimate security requirements can be met, there
                        will be no need for them to develop nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>To be successful in our nonproliferation endeavors, we must sustain and build
                        upon the multilateral and national policy foundations we have established.
                        As I indicated earlier, this requires constant attention to consultations
                        with other nuclear suppliers, peaceful nuclear cooperation with recipients,
                        and constructive support for international mechanisms which can lend
                        permanence to our nonproliferation policies.</p>
                    <p>This task warrants the most vigorous <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and
                        international efforts. We hope to work constructively with the Congress in
                        continuing to develop and implement a balanced <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> nonproliferation strategy—balanced in the need to maintain
                        our influence through prudent and reliable national export policies, the
                        importance of pursuing a multilateral as well as a national approach, and
                        the recognition that our overall foreign objectives can reinforce our
                        nonproliferation goals as we work to create a more stable world order.</p>

                    <p>The President has approved the following instructions for the negotiations on
                        underground nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes (<gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>) in Moscow. These instructions supplement
                        those contained in <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 297 and <gloss
                            target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 304.</p>
                    <p>1. For individual <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> events above 100
                            <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>, observers should be permitted as
                        needed for the purpose of verifying local geology, at the discretion of the
                        side verifying the explosion.</p>
                    <p>2. The Delegation should take the position that the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> agreement should have the same five-year duration provision
                        as the Threshold Test Ban Treaty (TTBT), with a provision for renewal for an
                        additional period, and a provision for consultations; the TTBT provides the
                        model to be followed.</p>
                    <p>3. The Delegation should inform the Soviets that we continue to prefer an
                        aggregate yield limit of 1000 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> for <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> salvos and that the ad referendum
                        agreement on <gloss target="#t_SLIFER_1">SLIFER</gloss> emplacement is
                        adequate for verification at that level. However, the Delegation is
                        authorized, at its discretion, to inform the Soviets that if they are
                        unwilling to agree to a 1000 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> limit, we
                        would be willing to consider a somewhat higher limit but only in exchange
                        for improved <gloss target="#t_SLIFER_1">SLIFER</gloss> yield determination
                        through the following modified emplacement rule:</p>
                    <p>a. For individual <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> yields up to 50 <gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> the canister length, L (in meters), should
                        be limited to a value given by the formula L = 5+W/20, where W is the stated
                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> yield in kilotons; and the lower
                        end of the <pb n="590" facs="0624" xml:id="pg_590"/>
                        <gloss target="#t_SLIFER_1">SLIFER</gloss> sensor should be a constant
                        distance of one meter from the top of the device canister.</p>
                    <p>b. For individual <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> yields between 50 and
                        150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>, the ad referendum agreement is
                        acceptable—e.g., the canister should be limited to a maximum length of 10
                        meters and the lower end of the <gloss target="#t_SLIFER_1">SLIFER</gloss>
                        sensor should be at a distance of 3W<hi rend="superscript">1/3</hi> meters
                        from the bottom of the canister.</p>
                    <p>Should the Soviet Delegation accept the principle of negotiating the modified
                            <gloss target="#t_SLIFER_1">SLIFER</gloss> emplacement rule, the
                        Delegation is authorized to accept an aggregate yield limit higher than 1000
                            <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> but not exceeding 1500 <gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> for <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        salvos.</p>
                    <p>4. The Delegation is also authorized to propose a 500 <gloss target="#t_KT_1"
                            >KT</gloss> threshold for deployment of an on-site seismometer
                        network.</p>
                    <p>5. The Delegation should take the position that the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> will not submit the TTBT for ratification until a
                        satisfactory <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> agreement is concluded. If
                        this is not achieved by March 31, 1976 the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> cannot put the TTBT into effect; the Delegation is
                        authorized to discuss how the two sides might proceed as of March 31, but
                        without committing the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to a suspension
                        of weapons tests above 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> unless
                        instructions are received from Washington.</p>
                    <p>6. The Delegation should proceed to complete the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> negotiations as soon as possible, but without considering
                        March 31, 1976 as a deadline.</p>

                    <p>In accordance with the President’s decision (Tab A) Under Secretary of State
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCE_1">Carlyle E. Maw</persName> and I held
                        discussions with the Shah on February 23, 1976 in Tehran in an effort to (1)
                        seek to clarify the Shah’s concern with the current <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> negotiating position on a nuclear agreement, and (2)
                        expose the Shah to reasons for our concern over the proliferation of
                        national reprocessing facilities.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">DISCUSSIONS</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The discussions opened by the Shah receiving and reading the President’s
                        letter (Tab B). The Shah then proceeded to make the following points:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>—He agrees with the President but “what more do you want me to do?”</p>
                        <p>—Iran signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty after serious consideration and
                            it intends to abide by all of its terms.</p>
                        <p>—Iran has no reason to develop nuclear weapons. It could never have
                            sufficient capability to deter the Soviet Union or to fight back.</p>
                        <p>—Iran does not understand why the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            does not trust Iran to develop fully its peaceful nuclear power
                            program.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>In response we drew on the following arguments:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>—We believe we all can reap the benefits of nuclear power provided the
                            key statesmen like the Shah recognize the potential serious<pb n="592"
                                facs="0626" xml:id="pg_592"/>ness of the diversion or misuse of
                            nuclear materials and the need to have effective worldwide
                            safeguards.</p>
                        <p>—The area of reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, including the storage
                            and fabrication of the separated plutonium, gives us the greatest
                            concern, especially, since the Indian explosion of a nuclear device.</p>
                        <p>—We recognize that when we supply equipment and nuclear material to
                            another nation we cannot escape a shared responsibility with the
                            recipient in the ultimate use of the equipment or material.</p>
                        <p>—There are several unknown factors in reprocessing. It is not clear that
                            the reprocessing is going to prove economical, at least not without the
                            benefits of economy of scale. It is also not clear, since the <gloss
                                target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> is just beginning to study the
                            matter, how effective <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards
                            will be.</p>
                        <p>—We feel that the emphasis should be on fewer and hence larger plants
                            that will have economy of scale. In doing so, in given regions of the
                            world this would involve the participation of several nations thus
                            providing naturally a measure of safety through an inherent check and
                            balance.</p>
                        <p>—We are quite cognizant of the difficulties that might arise in executing
                            multilateral plans. We are prepared to agree that the execution can
                            often be simplified by going to bilateral arrangements which actively
                            engage the supplier in the operation of the facility.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>After making these several points, we said that we visualize a multinational
                        reprocessing plant to serve the region of the Middle East and, hopefully, it
                        might be in Iran. We would like to be assured that we would have the Shah’s
                        fullest cooperation in working out some mutually satisfactory and
                        economically sound arrangement for a reprocessing plant in Iran or in which
                        Iran would participate and which would meet our mutual concerns as to
                        possible diversion or misuse of nuclear fuel. The Shah indicated that he
                        would seriously consider a reprocessing plant in Iran with participation of
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and others as might be
                        appropriate.</p>
                    <p>The Shah indicated that before embarking on the construction of reprocessing
                        plants in Iran, that he would review the matter carefully with the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and would expect that this would be a
                        shared responsibility and that we jointly would review and participate in
                        the determination of the safeguards. He went further on to say that he
                        wanted to work with the United States, that Iran wanted Westinghouse-type
                        reactors, and, in addition, Iran would certainly still consider investing in
                        a Uranium Enrichment Associates plant.</p>
                    <p>In the latter respect, we indicated that if Iran were to join the financing
                        of this organization or any of the others that were now contemplated, we
                        would expect Iran to have a percentage of the output commensurate with the
                        percentage of their investment; and, that all the low enriched uranium to
                        which Iran was entitled could be transferred to Iranian soil and stored
                        there; or, if Iran wished, could be retransferred to third countries having
                        an appropriate <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> agreement for
                        cooperation.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">CONCLUSIONS</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Shah seemed to appreciate and to accept the premise that the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and Iran had a shared responsibility to
                        assure the proper use of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> supplied
                        nuclear facilities and material.</p>
                    <p>The Shah clearly indicated his willingness to consider the reprocessing issue
                        in detail in an effort to find a cooperative and mutually satisfactory
                        undertaking having in mind that our ultimate goals are identical: The
                        avoidance of nuclear weapons proliferation. The Shah never indicated,
                        however, that he would accept <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        conditions on reprocessing or whether or not he would accept reprocessing
                        solely on a multinational scale.</p>
                    <p>In essence, the Shah’s position seemed to be that if our mutual
                        non-proliferation goals can be accomplished through a reprocessing plant on
                        Iranian soil, consistent with Iranian national sovereignty and honor and its
                        adherence to the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>, it would receive his
                        careful consideration.</p>
                    <p>At no point, however, did the Shah recede from his basic principle that no
                        further controls on Iran were necessary in so far as nuclear weapons were
                        concerned. They had signed the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> and
                        would live up to their undertakings. From his point of view, and for the
                        purpose of non-proliferation, no further commitments were necessary.</p>
                    <p>On the basis of this discussion with the Shah we conclude that any
                        arrangement in which the United States endeavors to retain an ultimate veto
                        on reprocessing of spent fuel in Iran will be unacceptable to the Shah.</p>
                    <p rend="center">
                        <hi rend="italic">RECOMMENDATIONS</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Taking into account comments and recommendations provided on the study of
                        November 20, 1975 regarding negotiating of a nuclear agreement with Iran and
                        these discussions with the Shah, I believe that the most probable direction
                        in which to move towards a resolution of the current impasse satisfactory to
                        both parties would encompass the following approach:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>—Iran would agree to exert strenuous efforts toward the establishment of
                            a multinational or binational reprocessing facility.</p>
                        <p>—Iran would accord the United States a continuing opportunity to
                            participate in such a facility.</p>
                        <p>—The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would consent to reprocessing
                            of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> material in an Iranian
                            national facility, if Iran was unable to achieve a multinational or
                            binational reprocessing capability.</p>
                        <p>—<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> consent would be subject to:</p>
                        <p>(1) the continuing requirement that we be satisfied the safeguards
                            applied to these activities by the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1"
                                >IAEA</gloss> are effective, and</p>
                        <p>(2) the right to assign staff to the facility if in the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> judgment this is necessary to
                            supplement <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <pb n="594" facs="0628" xml:id="pg_594"/>
                    <p>I believe this approach accommodates our interests in so far as it delays a
                        decision on the nature of an Iranian reprocessing plant until the concept of
                        a multinational or binational plant is thoroughly explored, with the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> having the clear opportunity to
                        participate if it so desires. I would expect that this aspect would have
                        congressional support.</p>
                    <p>I believe that the Shah will find the approach promising in so far as it does
                        not preclude a national plant in Iran if Iran is unable to obtain a
                        multinational or binational facility. I would expect, however, that the
                        absence of a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> veto on the reprocessing
                        of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> material will be challenged by some
                        members of Congress as furthering proliferation, particularly, in a
                        sensitive region of the world.</p>
                    <p>With <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> approval subject to the continuing
                        requirement of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> satisfaction with the
                        effectiveness of <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards and the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> right to supplement these
                        safeguards if it considers this necessary, the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> would have assurance that the safeguards will be effective
                        in terms of deterring and detecting the diversion of material. While I
                        believe that the Shah can be made to view this aspect as a shared
                        responsibility, he may find it unacceptable on the grounds that it signals a
                        continued mistrust of Iran. I would expect Congress, on the other hand, to
                        welcome the increased presence of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        in the implementation of safeguards but probably not to the extent of fully
                        satisfying their concerns of a national reprocessing plant in Iran.</p>
                    <p>The Shah expects that further negotiations will take place during the visit
                        to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> of the President of the Iranian
                        Atomic Energy Organization now scheduled for the week of April 19, 1976. I
                        recommend that the momentum created by the President’s letter and these
                        discussions not be dissipated; and therefore, I urge that our negotiating
                        position be developed and congressional consultations pursued with the
                        objective of resuming negotiations at that time. Since the Shah indicated
                        that he will reply to the President’s letter, it might be prudent to have
                        the Shah’s response in hand before actually resuming negotiations, but I
                        would not delay our preparations pending receipt of his response.</p>
                    <p>While Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MCE_1">Maw</persName> agrees with
                        my account of our meeting with the Shah and shares my conclusions, I am
                        informed that the Department of State will wish to submit separately its
                        recommendations on the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> negotiating

                        <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 256 of June 10, 1974, which spelled
                        out the basic <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> position for a threshold
                        test ban, states that “the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> can accept a
                        provision allowing for no more than two unintended and slight breaches of
                        the threshold per year.” In October 1974, Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> obtained an oral understanding
                        regarding the interpretation of such “unintended and slight” breaches.</p>
                    <p>Until two months ago, I was unaware of this oral understanding; and to my
                        knowledge, it had not come to the attention of the Verification Panel. We
                        have since analyzed the implications of the understanding reached and sought
                        to clarify its content with your staff (see attached Marcum/Rochlin <gloss
                            target="#t_memcon_1">memcon</gloss>).</p>
                    <p>In my view this oral understanding is too loose. It could lead to serious
                        difficulties in monitoring compliance and might well be subject to
                        substantial Senate criticism during the ratification process. I therefore
                        recommend that:</p>
                    <p>(1) We should formulate considerably tighter criteria on this issue than the
                        October 1974 understanding, and</p>
                    <p>(2) We should go back to the Soviets and seek a formal commitment from them
                        to abide by the same criteria.</p>
                    <p>From a tactical point of view, it seems to me these steps ought to be taken
                        before we wind up the negotiations in Moscow on the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> Agreement and the related <gloss target="#t_TTB_1"

                        the conversation, they discussed the ongoing peaceful nuclear explosion
                        negotiations:</p>
                    <p>“I then said that the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> talks were going
                        nowhere fast and it looks like March 31 will come and go without agreement.
                            <persName corresp="#p_VY_1">Vorontsov</persName> said this will require
                        some diplomatic action with respect to the TTBT. I said we were considering
                        how to handle the passing of the originally envisaged effective date for the

                        said this remains under study but I personally found it hard to get my teeth
                        into the concept. <persName corresp="#p_VY_1">Vorontsov</persName> said they
                        were interested in our ideas, as <persName corresp="#p_KG_1"

                            >Vorontsov</persName> had mentioned to you. I said the matter remained

                    <p>“<persName corresp="#p_VY_1">Vorontsov</persName> asked whether we would have
                        any further response on their proposals for a comprehensive test ban. I said

                    <p>2. In Moscow summit communiqué of July 1974 and again in November 1974
                        Vladivostok communiqué, <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> agreed to consider joint <gloss
                            target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> initiative on most dangerous, lethal
                            <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>. In August 1974, Soviets privately
                        presented us with draft <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> treaty which, as
                        described in Ref A, failed to deal adequately with verification and took an
                        unbalanced approach to scope of prohibitions (adopting toxicity standard
                        that would ban production and stockpiling of <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss> agents, primarily supertoxics, that constitute major share
                        of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> stocks, while excluding less toxic
                        lethal agents, such as hydrogen cyanide, that others are believed to have in
                        their stockpiles). In April 1975, we asked the Soviets some questions
                        regarding their draft, pointing out our difficulties with their treatment of
                        scope and verification (Ref A). In their response in June 1975 (Ref B), the
                        Soviets urged us to put forward <pb n="599" facs="0633" xml:id="pg_599"
                        />concrete ideas of our own and proposed follow-up bilateral technical
                        meetings, which we turned down. Since then, Soviet officials have
                        periodically inquired about our readiness to pursue joint initiative.</p>
                    <p>3. From del’s reporting, we are aware that several <gloss target="#t_CCD_1"
                            >CCD</gloss> members, including Canada, Japan, and Sweden, have stated
                        that they are no longer prepared to permit promise of joint initiative to
                        delay progress toward <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> agreement. We see
                        considerable risk that efforts will be made, particularly by non-aligned, to
                        move issue forward without <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, perhaps by
                        introducing draft treaty. We would expect any non-aligned treaty proposal to
                        contain provisions (e.g., on verification and scope) unacceptable to <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and to prejudice reception of possible
                        joint initiative.</p>
                    <p>4. Aside from possibility of such action by non-aligned, we are concerned by
                        attempts of Soviet allies, in increasingly pointed <gloss target="#t_CCD_1"
                            >CCD</gloss> statements, to place blame entirely on <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> for failure to produce joint initiative.
                        Our continued silence in committee on <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>
                        issues could reinforce credibility of charges by Eastern Europeans and place
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> in difficult and isolated
                        position.</p>
                    <p>5. <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> has not yet taken decision regarding
                        possible agreed limitations on <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> production
                        and stockpiles. Nonetheless, in light of problems discussed above, we
                        consider it appropriate at this time to take action on <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>, both with respect to Soviets and to <gloss
                            target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss>. Objectives of approach will be (a) to
                        head off support for, and perhaps introduction of treaty draft embodying,
                        approach to <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> restraints that we would find
                        unacceptable; (b) to emphasize, both to Soviets and to other <gloss
                            target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> members, importance we attach to
                        verification; and (c) to keep open bilateral channel for future work on
                            <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> question.</p>
                    <p>6. <gloss target="#t_Del_1">Del</gloss> should approach Soviet <gloss
                            target="#t_Del_1">Del</gloss> at earliest opportunity to make points
                        outlined below on scope, definition, and verification of phased <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> agreement. In addition, after presentation
                        to Soviets, <gloss target="#t_Del_1">Del</gloss> should make statement in
                            <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> plenary based, as appropriate, on
                        points conveyed to Soviets, emphasizing that, before <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss> agreement can be reached, committee must achieve fuller
                        understanding of <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> verification issues,
                        especially those techniques likely to contribute most significantly to an
                        adequate verification system. <gloss target="#t_Del_1">Del</gloss> should
                        not convey impression, either in approach to Soviets or in speech, that
                            <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> has taken policy decisions on
                            <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> or that it supports any particular
                        approach to <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> restraints.</p>
                    <p>7. In approach to Soviets, del should make following points:</p>
                    <p>(A) We have given careful consideration to the Soviet views on <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> questions that were presented to us last
                        June 9 in Washington. We would like now to comment on some of the issues
                        raised by the Soviet Government at that time as well as to provide our views
                        on <pb n="600" facs="0634" xml:id="pg_600"/>some other <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> questions that are relevant to an
                        examination of the possibility of a <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                        >U.S.</gloss>-Soviet initiative at the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1"
                        >CCD</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>(B) We continue to believe strongly that any agreement on <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> must provide adequate assurance to states
                        that they are not increasing the risk to their national security by adhering
                        to the agreement. An adequate verification system is an essential component
                        of such assurance. In our judgment, the inability so far to find effective
                        solutions in the area of verification is the principal obstacle to a <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> agreement. Accordingly, we consider it
                        important, in considering a joint <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>
                        initiative, that the two sides give particular attention to verification
                        issues, especially to those techniques that might contribute most
                        significantly to an adequate verification system.</p>
                    <p>(C) We have stated on several occasions that the scope of <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> prohibitions must be based on verification
                        capabilities. Since no solution to the problem of detecting clandestine
                            <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> stocks has yet been devised, we do
                        not believe our common objective of the complete prohibition of <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> can be achieved in a single, comprehensive
                        agreement. We support instead a phased approach.</p>
                    <p>(D) Several states have made suggestions for limiting the coverage of a
                        first-stage agreement to highly toxic agents, excluding from coverage less
                        toxic lethal agents. The Soviet draft treaty of August 1974 follows this
                        approach. As we indicated to the Soviet Government in April 1975, we
                        consider this approach to be an unbalanced one. We believe instead that a
                        first-stage agreement should cover all lethal <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss> agents.</p>
                    <p>(E) An agreement on lethal <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> banning
                        activities on a phased basis could be structured in various ways. Some
                        examples are:</p>
                    <p>(1) An agreement requiring the reduction of lethal <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss> stocks to agreed levels, but placing no restriction on
                            <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> production;</p>
                    <p>(2) An agreement banning all lethal <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>
                        production, but not affecting stocks; and</p>
                    <p>(3) An agreement to ban production of lethal <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss> agents and to destroy some specified quantity of lethal
                            <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> stocks over a certain period. We
                        believe it would be useful to examine the advantages and disadvantages of
                        these and other possible approaches to phased <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss> limitations.</p>
                    <p>(F) Various approaches to the duration of an initial agreement might be
                        considered. For example, it would be possible, as in the Japanese draft
                        treaty, to adopt a comprehensive framework that would limit the initial
                        scope of the prohibition and provide for broadening of the scope only as
                        further agreements were reached. Alternatively, an agreement might be of
                        limited duration, with provision for review and extension. We would be
                        interested in Soviet views on these and other alternative approaches to the
                        question of treaty duration.</p>
                    <pb n="601" facs="0635" xml:id="pg_601"/>
                    <p>(G) We believe it would be useful to arrive at a common understanding
                        regarding criteria for defining the <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>
                        agents to be covered in any agreement banning the production of all lethal
                            <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>. It is our tentative view that it
                        would be adequate to rely on a general purpose criterion and two toxicity
                        standards—the lower one to distinguish lethal chemical substances from other
                        substances and the higher one to distinguish supertoxic substances from less
                        toxic but nonetheless lethal substances. The general purpose criterion would
                        apply to all lethal chemical substances—that is, all substances falling
                        above the lower toxicity standard. According to that criterion, the
                        production of all single-purpose lethal substances would be prohibited,
                        while the production of all dual-purpose substances would be permitted only
                        for peaceful purposes. In addition, the production of all precursors of
                        lethal <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> agents, including precursors used
                        in multicomponent weapons, would be prohibited. The upper toxicity standard
                        would assist in the application of the general purpose criterion. All
                        substances falling above the upper threshold would be presumed, because of
                        their extremely high toxicity, to be single-purpose <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss> agents. The production of such substances would therefore be
                        banned, except those that were demonstrated to be necessary for peaceful
                        purposes, in which cases special control procedures would apply. In
                        practice, we would expect very few supertoxic substances to be required for
                        peaceful purposes.</p>
                    <p>(H) We find promising the approach outlined by Canada for establishing
                        specific toxicity standards. Under that approach, for both the lower and
                        upper toxicity levels separate standards of lethality would be adopted for
                        each of the three principal routes of entry into the human body. These
                        standards might be expressed in terms of LD 50 values or in terms of
                        reference chemical substances. As discussed in <gloss target="#t_CCD_1"
                            >CCD</gloss>/435, we believe an LD 50 (subscript) value of 0.5 mg/kg, or
                        a value close to it, might be the optimal value for the upper threshold. For
                        the lower threshold, Canada has suggested a value of LCT 50 (subscript)
                        equal to 20,000 mg-min/M 3 (superscript). We believe this is a useful
                        starting point for discussions. For both the upper and lower thresholds,
                        equivalent LD 50 values or reference substances would have to be found for
                        each mode of administration. It would be essential, moreover, to devise
                        agreed common experimental procedures for measuring toxicity in order to
                        ensure uniform international application.</p>
                    <p>(I) To advance the prospects for agreement we believe the <gloss
                            target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> should now focus on verification
                        techniques that might be suitable for monitoring a production ban and the
                        reduction of stockpiles. One technique for monitoring a ban on production is
                        the exchange of information among treaty parties, perhaps through an
                        international treaty authority. While we regard as limited the effectiveness
                        of this <pb n="602" facs="0636" xml:id="pg_602"/>technique, we nonetheless
                        believe it could serve as a useful confidence-building device. We believe it
                        would be useful to seek to achieve a common understanding regarding
                        information that treaty parties should exchange. Additional verification
                        measures ought to be explored to increase confidence that production
                        activity is not resumed at deactivated facilities.</p>
                    <p>(J) Although the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> has studied many
                        techniques for providing a reasonable level of assurance that clandestine
                            <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> production is not taking place, none
                        has been found to be more reliable for resolving serious questions regarding
                        compliance, and for restoring confidence in compliance, than visits to the
                        facilities in question. We believe it is important, therefore, to consider
                        the modalities of an on-site inspection system.</p>
                    <p>(K) A verification system suitable for stockpile reduction would have to
                        provide confidence that the specified level of lethal <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> agent was actually being destroyed. We know
                        of no way to verify the destruction of declared stockpiles except by on-site
                        observation of the destruction process, and we believe that a procedure
                        could be devised that would not reveal industrial or military secrets.</p>
                    <p>(L) An effective verification system for stockpile destruction must be
                        capable of confirming that the type and quantity of the agent being
                        destroyed have been correctly represented. We would hope to provide Soviet
                        delegation in the near future with a paper stating preliminary views on
                        procedures, involving monitoring instruments and inspection personnel, that
                        we believe would be both feasible and helpful in achieving these objectives.
                        We hope the Soviet Government will give this question detailed technical
                        examination, drawing on its past experience in destroying highly toxic
                        materials.</p>
                    <p>(M) We believe that an international consultative body of treaty parties
                        could play an important role, not just to facilitate <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss> verification system, but more generally as a means of
                        ensuring the efficient operation of a <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>
                        treaty regime.</p>
                    <p>(N) We plan to elaborate on many of the above points in a plenary statement
                        that we will deliver shortly. We would be interested in hearing your
                        reaction to the issues raised here as well as in the <gloss

                    <p>8. If Soviets reiterate their request for bilateral technical meetings with
                        experts on <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>, del may respond that we plan
                        to send <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> experts to participate in

                    <p>5682. Subject: My Call on <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>:
                        Disarmament Questions.</p>
                    <p>1. During my call on Soviet Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2"
                            >Gromyko</persName> on April 12 on another matter (septel) I mentioned
                        successful conclusion of the negotiations for an agreement on peaceful
                        nuclear explosions (<gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>). I mentioned the
                        favorable comments by the President and the Secretary on the draft agreement
                        and said that those of us who were involved also felt that this was a useful
                        step forward. <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName> replied that
                        “we are very satisfied that we were able to reach agreement.” This is a good
                        step for bilateral relations and for the general state of international
                        relations, he continued.</p>
                    <p>2. He then asked about the status of the Soviet proposals to ban new weapons
                        of mass destruction (NWMD) which had been discussed during Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s visit. These
                        proposals, he said, seemed to be suspended between the ceiling and the floor
                        and he mentioned having sent us a note on the subject. I replied that our
                        answering note had pointed out that we were not prepared for talks yet and
                        that there had been no further word since that time. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName> said that following the <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> agreement we should move forward on other
                        matters such as the NWMD. I replied that perhaps such talks could be held in
                        the framework of the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> in Geneva, at
                        which <persName corresp="#p_KG_1">Korniyenko</persName> interjected that the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> had not sent its experts on this
                        subject to Geneva. I said that we would ask about the status of the proposed
                        talks on this subject.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName> then raised the question
                        of a comprehensive test ban agreement and said that the means to reach such
                        an agreement exists technically. Both sides, he said, should work toward it.
                        Although some countries will not participate (he mentioned China, France,
                        “and perhaps others”), it would still be beneficial if the two main nuclear
                        powers could agree to end all tests. Without it there is no example for
                        other countries to follow. Such an accord would draw attention to the
                        problem and would encourage others to follow suit. I said that we viewed <pb
                            n="604" facs="0638" xml:id="pg_604"/>the <gloss target="#t_TTB_1"
                            >TTB</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> agreements as
                        useful steps and that both needed to be completed before we could talk
                        concretely about further limitations on weapons tests or discussion of
                        multilateral application of the agreements. I stressed that we were still
                        not completely satisfied with the inspection and verification procedures in
                        connection with a <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> and that this
                        remained an area where we thought further steps would be necessary.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName> said that the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> is an appropriate forum for disarmament
                        discussions and various resolutions and various organs through which to
                        promote disarmament talks. <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>
                        mentioned <gloss target="#t_SYG_1">SYG</gloss> Waldheim’s proposals
                        concerning personnel for these <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> bodies,

                            target="#t_GDR_1">GDR</gloss> participated. Western delegations
                        including <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> raised questions about scope
                        and content of proposed <gloss target="#t_MDW_1">MDW</gloss> convention,
                        some (especially Canada and Italy) expressing strong skepticism and raising
                        Soviet hackles. Non-aligned delegations remained silent except India, which
                        supported <pb n="605" facs="0639" xml:id="pg_605"/>
                        <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> making efforts on question. Although a
                        number of possible “new” weapons applications based on various physical,
                        chemical and biological principles were suggested, scope and content of
                            <gloss target="#t_MDW_1">MDW</gloss> proposal remained pretty much
                        undefined. Soviets contended repeatedly that other <gloss target="#t_CCD_1"
                            >CCD</gloss> members had obligation to help sponsors put content into
                            <gloss target="#t_MDW_1">MDW</gloss> concept. They mooted, but did not
                        formally propose, establishing experts group on definition. However,
                        following meeting they seemed uncertain as to what they wanted to do next
                        regarding the proposal. Soviets later inquired as to future <gloss

                    </p>
                    <p>1. At Soviet request, <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> held three
                        informal meetings with experts April 7–8 on question of banning new weapons
                        of mass destruction and new systems of such weapons. Soviets sent two
                        experts, Hungary and <gloss target="#t_GDR_1">GDR</gloss> one each. No other
                        country was represented outside of its regular <gloss target="#t_CCD_1"
                            >CCD</gloss> delegation.</p>
                    <p>2. After introduction by Soviet Rep <persName corresp="#p_RAA_2"
                            >Roshchin</persName>, primary <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        expert, Academician Fokin of Academy of Sciences, led off discussion in
                        April 7 a.m. meeting. Turning first to question of specifying weapons to be
                        covered in draft <gloss target="#t_MDW_1">MDW</gloss> treaty, Fokin
                        cautioned that listing weapons ideas now in existence could omit even more
                        threatening weapons that might emerge in future. Nevertheless, he conceded,
                        some kind of definition must be arrived at.</p>
                    <p>3. Fokin focused on definitions of <gloss target="#t_MDW_1">MDW</gloss> in
                        terms of their objectives (mass destruction of people, loss of self-defense
                        capability, death), their methods of employment (physical, chemical,
                        biological, genetic), and their effects (on men, environment, productivity).
                        He asserted that certain <gloss target="#t_RD_1">R&amp;D</gloss> areas must
                        be defined for prohibition, but did not state what these were. New weapons
                        of mass destruction could be based on existing technology; on principles
                        already developed (particle annihilation); or on entirely new principles. As
                        specific examples Fokin cited transuranic fission weapons and laser fusion;
                        the examples were drawn from presentations at an open symposium in <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> in 1970, meeting without amplification or
                        addition (Fokin made no direct attempt to include for prohibition new
                        systems for the employment of existing (e.g., nuclear or chemical)
                        weapons).</p>
                    <p>4. Fokin added that a basic definition of <gloss target="#t_MDW_1"
                            >MDW</gloss> would involve three aspects: (a) objects of use, e.g.,
                        human systems, environment, energy systems; (b) method of operation; (c)
                        realization of the effect (i.e., losses suffered). Filling in this basic
                        definition would give rise to all-encompassing definition.</p>
                    <p>5. Upon conclusion of Fokin’s statement, <persName corresp="#p_MJJ_1"
                            >Martin</persName> (<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>) put forward
                        following questions pursuant to instructions contained <gloss
                            target="#t_REFReftel_1">reftel</gloss>:</p>
                    <p>(A) What specific items would be included as examples of “new types” and “new
                        systems” in Article I, Paragraph 1, of the draft convention?</p>
                    <p>(B) What “new types” of weapons of mass destruction do Soviet experts believe
                        may emerge in the foreseeable future?</p>
                    <pb n="606" facs="0640" xml:id="pg_606"/>
                    <p>(C) What physical principles do Soviet experts believe could eventually
                        provide the basis for a new type of mass destruction weapon?</p>
                    <p>(D) Article I, Paragraph 2, of the Soviet draft provides for further
                        negotiations if new areas emerge in the development and manufacture of
                        weapons of mass destruction and systems of such weapons not covered by the
                        agreement. What is the meaning of the phrase “new areas”? How would
                        agreement be reached as to whether or not new areas or systems had emerged?
                        (Questions had been handed to SoviDel in advance.)</p>
                    <p>6. Schlaich (<gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>) could not see how Soviet
                        proposal could achieve the praiseworthy aim of preventive arms control. He
                        said that authoritative interpretation of certain concepts was still
                        lacking, e.g., it was unclear whether “new weapons” are completely new or
                        embody development of existing ABC weapons. Schlaich asked whether genetic
                        engineering was not actually covered by the Biological Weapons Convention.
                        Commenting that verification and proof in context of <gloss
                            target="#t_MDW_1">MDW</gloss> draft treaty seemed insurmountable
                        problem, he called the complaints procedure involving Security Council
                        “entirely inadequate.”</p>
                    <p>7. Allen (<gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>) was especially concerned
                        regarding the distinction between “new types” and “new systems” of <gloss
                            target="#t_MDW_1">MDW</gloss>. He agreed with Schlaich’s suggestion that
                        genetic engineering was already covered by <gloss target="#t_BWC_1"
                            >BWC</gloss> and added that in considering the <gloss target="#t_MDW_1"
                            >MDW</gloss> question one must be careful to analyze what is and what is
                        not covered by existing international instruments.</p>
                    <p>8. Di Bernardo (Italy) said “real life” definition of <gloss
                            target="#t_MDW_1">MDW</gloss> was needed, but doubted that such
                        definition could be developed. It was necessary, he said, to put content
                        into any <gloss target="#t_MDW_1">MDW</gloss> agreement which at same time
                        must not impede the beneficial development of new scientific techniques. Di
                        Bernardo concluded that more specificity regarding proposal was needed in
                        any case.</p>
                    <p>9. Ericsson (Sweden) asked whether draft treaty referred to new weapons and
                        new systems of such new weapons or alternatively new systems of already
                        extant <gloss target="#t_MDW_1">MDW</gloss>. He proposed that if intention
                        was former, Article I be rephrased as “new weapons of <gloss
                            target="#t_MDW_1">MDW</gloss> and new systems of such new weapons.”</p>
                    <p>10. Concluding morning’s discussion, <persName corresp="#p_RAA_2"
                            >Roshchin</persName> protested that Soviets wanted other countries to go
                        beyond “negative questions” that had been raised. <gloss target="#t_MDW_1"
                            >MDW</gloss> definition, he said, was not the sole responsibility of the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. This was why informal meeting
                        with experts had been called. <persName corresp="#p_RAA_2"
                            >Roshchin</persName> quite impassionedly maintained that all other
                        members of <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> had obligation to add
                        content to Soviet proposal. Thus he called on others to provide answers to
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> questions, as he assured Soviets
                        would.</p>
                    <pb n="607" facs="0641" xml:id="pg_607"/>
                    <p>11. In April 7 afternoon meeting second Soviet expert, Col. Sourikov, said
                        two courses could be pursued: experts could develop definition of <gloss
                            target="#t_MDW_1">MDW</gloss> and then move on to identifying specific
                        weapons, or, alternatively, they could follow a concept which had been put
                        forward earlier and establish a list of <gloss target="#t_MDW_1">MDW</gloss>
                        and develop general prohibition from that. Definition, Sourikov said, should
                        take into account new physical, chemical, or biological principles that
                        could be used for military purposes, and measure these in terms of what they
                        could do to humans. Under term <gloss target="#t_MDW_1">MDW</gloss>, he
                        continued, should be considered new types of conduct of warfare that are
                        being or may be found in research or study stage, based on qualitatively new
                        methods of action and meant for new objectives of discussion.</p>
                    <p>12. Hungarian maintained that banning <gloss target="#t_MDW_1">MDW</gloss>
                        was important because most such weapons are strategic in nature and if one
                        country develops them others will have to as well. He stated that Soviet
                        experts alone could not answer all questions put to them; answers could be
                        found only after lengthy consultations in committee.</p>
                    <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_MBC_1">Mishra</persName> (India), the only
                        non-aligned representative to intervene, supported the idea of a <gloss
                            target="#t_MDW_1">MDW</gloss> convention. He said the <gloss
                            target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> should pursue its consideration of this
                        subject, which process could lead to “significant developments.”</p>
                    <p>14. Opening April 8 informal meeting, <gloss target="#t_GDR_1">GDR</gloss>
                        Rep Herder called it regrettable that other technologically advanced states
                        had so far only asked questions. They should, he said, have volunteered
                        “positive information.”</p>
                    <p>15. Herder then introduced <gloss target="#t_GDR_1">GDR</gloss> expert, Prof.
                        Lohs, a chemical toxicologist. In quite thorough presentation, Lohs proposed
                        examples of new chemical weapons. These included new families of binary
                        weapons based on high-toxicity carbamates and nitrosamines, which are too
                        unstable for use in other than binary form. Synthetic toxins and
                        pain-producing agents were cited as another example of possible future
                        binary technology. Synthetically produced toxic peptides could undermine
                        existing agreements.</p>
                    <p>16. According to Lohs delayed toxic effects could become important, as could
                        highly toxic by-products of herbicides that can be produced as main
                        components, which compare with V-agents in toxicity but for which, in
                        contrast to the V-agents, there is no technically possible means of
                        detoxification. Contamination of a town with, e.g., dioxin, would render it
                        uninhabitable permanently without other damage. Effects of dioxin are
                        long-lasting and can exterminate large population groups through diseases of
                        metabolism or cancer. An additional example involved so-called “ethnic
                        weapons,” specific in their effects against certain ethnic groups due to the
                        genetic disposition or enzymatic polymorphism of those groups. Such weapons,
                        Lohs maintained, could <pb n="608" facs="0642" xml:id="pg_608"/>selectively
                        exterminate specific ethnic populations without damaging others.</p>
                    <p>17. <persName corresp="#p_BWH_1">Barton</persName> (Canada) said his
                        delegation had found Soviet experts’ presentations “thought-provoking and
                        illustrative of the vast dimensions of the problems coming within the scope
                        of the Soviet initiative.” Nevertheless, <persName corresp="#p_BWH_1"
                            >Barton</persName> said, procedures set forth in Article I of draft
                            <gloss target="#t_MDW_1">MDW</gloss> agreement seemed inadequate to
                        provide necessary definitions of what weapons and weapons types would be
                        covered. <persName corresp="#p_BWH_1">Barton</persName> said that as with
                            <gloss target="#t_EnMod_1">EnMod</gloss> treaty it was necessary to
                        define what was being banned with enough specificity so there would be no
                        ambiguity about intentions and obligations being undertaken by treaty
                        parties.</p>
                    <p>18. <persName corresp="#p_BWH_1">Barton</persName> raised another question
                        relating to implementation of an agreement on <gloss target="#t_MDW_1"
                            >MDW</gloss> prohibition. In view of the sweeping nature of such an
                        agreement he supposed it could not be implemented without adherence of all
                        technologically and militarily advanced nations. But, he said, he would
                        appreciate hearing Soviet views on this point which was “of some relevance
                        in the light of the approach of some governments to these matters.”</p>
                    <p>19. Soviets then essayed response to questions raised by Western delegations,
                        especially <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> According to Fokin, “new
                        types of <gloss target="#t_MDW_1">MDW</gloss>” involved new means of waging
                        war based on a new effect, chemical, physical or other. “New systems”
                        involved the carrier and control mechanisms. Regarding specific “new types,”
                        Fokin postulated, e.g., “ethnic war” based on biochemical characteristics of
                        races, psychotropic chemicals, use of infrasound and subsonic frequencies,
                        acoustic and optical principles (lasers?), and radiological weapons.</p>
                    <p>20. Regarding “new areas” question, <persName corresp="#p_RAA_2"
                            >Roshchin</persName> said Fokin had pointed to three categories of
                            <gloss target="#t_MDW_1">MDW</gloss> “that seem achievable:” (a) those

                            >Roshchin</persName> maintained that draft treaty text answered question
                        regarding agreement whether or not new area or system had emerged. This was
                        to be subject of negotiation, he said.</p>
                    <p>21. In reply to other Western questions, <persName corresp="#p_RAA_2"
                            >Roshchin</persName> (a) doubted that <gloss target="#t_MDW_1"
                            >MDW</gloss> agreement would inhibit peaceful uses; (b) said not all
                        technologically advanced states would need to join agreement. On latter
                        point, he noted that “big majority” in <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1"
                            >UNGA</gloss>, including Canada, had voted to refer <gloss

                            >CCD</gloss>; therefore he hoped that large number of technologically
                        advanced countries would in fact participate in eventual agreement.</p>
                    <p>22. Meeting concluded with expressions of appreciation to experts, and with
                        repeated <persName corresp="#p_RAA_2">Roshchin</persName> appeal to all
                            <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> members to participate fully in

                        contribution which would justify sending experts. If, however, the Soviets
                        were prepared to designate specific areas or topics as the subject for
                        consideration, Washington would be better able to consider in connection
                        with its evaluation of the present meetings whether it would be worthwhile
                        to send experts to future meetings.</p>

                            >U.S.</gloss> Department of State of the following:</p>
                    <p>—With regard to note of the Department of State of December 23, 1975, the
                        competent Soviet organs conducted a careful analysis of the data connected
                        with the execution of underground nuclear tests in the Soviet Union on
                        August 23, October 18, and October 21, 1975. The examination showed that in
                        the conduct of these explosions all the conditions necessary to exclude the
                        possibility of a fallout of radioactive particles (chastitsy) outside the
                        territory of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> were created and
                        observed;</p>
                    <p>—The Soviet side cannot agree with the statement contained in the note of the
                        State Department that a violation of the provisions of the Moscow Treaty of
                        1963 supposedly took place.</p>
                    <p>—The Soviet Union, as has been declared many times, attaches great
                        significance to the observance of the conditions of the Treaty Banning
                        Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water, in
                        accordance with which explosions are prohibited that cause radioactive
                        fallout (osadki) beyond the bounds of national territory. The appropriate
                        Soviet organs have taken and will continue to take necessary measures
                        directed toward strict fulfillment of the demands of this treaty.</p>
                    <p>—At the same time, the Soviet side cannot but direct the attention of the
                        American side to the fact that the appropriate Soviet monitoring services
                        have more than once registered outside the national borders of the <gloss
                            target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> the appearance of radioactive products
                        (produkty) from nuclear tests conducted by the <gloss target="#t_USA_1"
                            >USA</gloss>. Such radioactive products were detected, in particular,
                        from explosions conducted by the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> on
                        January 3 and February 4, 1976. The Soviet side expects that the American
                        side will take appropriate measures to exclude such occurrences in the
                        future. <hi rend="italic">End text.</hi>

                    <p>Following your instructions (Tab D), <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss>
                        Administrator <persName corresp="#p_SRC_1">Seamans</persName>, accompanied
                        by Under Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_MCE_1">Maw</persName>, met
                        with the Shah in Tehran to exchange views on those aspects of our draft
                        nuclear agreement which remain unresolved. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SRC_1"
                            >Seamans</persName> has reported to you in detail on the talks (Tab C),
                        and the Shah has responded to your letter carried by <persName
                            corresp="#p_SRC_1">Seamans</persName> (Tab B).</p>
                    <p>The discussions focused primarily on the question of chemical reprocessing in
                        national facilities and our perception of its relationship to a global
                        non-proliferation strategy. The Shah emphatically reiterated his commitment
                        to non-proliferation objectives for his country and for the world. However,
                        while he would want to consult with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        and actively seek our cooperation (or that of other major nuclear supplier
                        states) in establishing a reprocessing facility in Iran on a joint basis, he
                        has been unwilling to commit to such a joint venture as the sine qua non for
                        our approval of the reprocessing of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                        >U.S.</gloss>-supplied fuel in Iran.</p>
                    <pb n="612" facs="0646" xml:id="pg_612"/>
                    <p>It was agreed in the meeting with the Shah that Dr. Etemad, President of the
                        Iranian Atomic Energy Commission, would come here to make a concerted effort
                        at resolving our differences and reaching ad referendum agreement on the
                        provisions of a nuclear agreement. Dr. Etemad will be in Washington on April
                        20–21 for these negotiations, and your decision is needed on our negotiating
                        position.</p>
                    <p>The lack of a nuclear agreement represents a serious irritant in our
                        relations with Iran. It also is an obstacle to the leading <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> private enrichment venture—Uranium
                        Enrichment Associates—in obtaining Iran’s commitment to be a major investor
                        and customer. It is in our interest, therefore, to be as forthcoming as
                        possible, consistent with our non-proliferation objectives and Congressional
                        attitudes.</p>
                    <p>The options for our position in our talks with Dr. Etemad are:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>—Maintain our current position that reprocessing be carried out in Iran
                            only on a multinational basis, with binational partnership between Iran
                            and the supplier of the reprocessing technology (e.g., the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>) being an acceptable fallback.</p>
                        <p>—Same as above, however, if Iran is unable to find a partner(s), and we
                            do not wish to participate, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            would have the option to buy back (or exchange additional fuel for)
                            Iran’s spent fuel to obviate the need for reprocessing. Finally, if we
                            were not to exercise the buy-back option, Iran would be permitted to
                            reprocess in a national plant, with the understanding that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> could supplement the safeguards of the
                            International Atomic Energy Agency with bilateral measures.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>The first option is our present position and has been rejected by Iran. It
                        would be the most acceptable to Congress. <gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                            >DOD</gloss> continues to support it, but could be expected to
                        reluctantly accept the second option (agency views are at Tab E).</p>
                    <p>The second option introduces the new concept of buy-back and we are uncertain
                        as to Iran’s reaction. For practical and philosophical reasons, they may not
                        be willing to condition their reprocessing on an unpredictable future <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> decision regarding buy-back. This second
                        option would face greater resistance on the <persName corresp="#p_HRC_1"
                            >Hill</persName> than the first option but might still be acceptable.
                        State and <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> support the second option,
                        and State would be willing to drop the buy-back provision as our final
                        fallback position. <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss> prefers the second
                        option and would support dropping the buy-back provision if, as they believe
                        it will, the proposal proves unacceptable to Iran. <gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                            >DOD</gloss> does not favor the second option out of philosophical
                        concern for the proliferation impact.</p>
                    <p>It seems pointless and quite possibly counter productive to consider pursuing
                        the first option. Our non-proliferation goals are largely met by the second
                        option since it reserves to us the option to participate in an (eventual)
                        Iranian reprocessing plant, either in the role of co-owner or as the
                        provider of supplementary safeguards. I recommend you approve the second
                        option and authorize the buy-back requirement <pb n="613" facs="0647"
                            xml:id="pg_613"/>be withdrawn if necessary to reach agreement. The
                        overall position is consistent with our interest in maintaining close
                        relations with Iran. Congressional and <gloss target="#t_NRC_1">NRC</gloss>
                        support will be confirmed before returning the agreement for your
                        approval.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation:</p>
                    <p>That you approve the second option and approve my signing the necessary

                    <p>—Seek a strong political commitment from Iran to pursue the

                        alternative to a national reprocessing facility.</p>
                    <p>—Seek a commitment from Iran to consult closely with us on its prospective
                        reprocessing plans before making any firm decision whether multinational or
                        otherwise. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> side should offer to
                        help Iran assess, in detail, the economic viability of proceeding with any
                        reprocessing venture and the modalities of possible multinational
                        configurations.</p>
                    <p>—In the event Iran agrees to make efforts to establish a multinational plant
                        and is unsuccessful, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> should have
                        the option to recover the plutonium produced in <gloss target="#t_US_1"

                        exchange. Were the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> not to exercise this
                        option, we would be prepared to consent to reprocessing in an Iranian plant
                        subject to: (a) the continuing requirement that we be satisfied that the
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards applied to the
                        facilities are effective; and (b) Iranian agreement that the <gloss

                            target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards through the assignment of
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> technical personnel, if necessary.
                        Should it prove essential, in the view of the negotiators, to the
                        achievement of an ad referendum agreement, they are authorized to withdraw
                        the plutonium buy-back option.</p>
                    <p>—Seek (1) to maintain the integrity of the text of the basic draft Agreement
                        for Cooperation in the Civil Uses of Atomic Energy, which includes a
                        provision requiring mutual consent for the reprocessing, storage, and
                        fabrication of plutonium derived from <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        fuel or reactors, and (2) to provide Iran in an accompanying note a
                        statement of the conditions, as outlined above, under which <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> consent would be granted. If Iran objects
                        strongly to this arrangement, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> side
                        should, in return for a clear high-level commitment from Iran to pursue the
                        binational/multinational concept, agree to incorporate the statement of the
                        conditions of consent in the body of the agreement.</p>
                    <p>If an ad referendum agreement is reached, key members of Congress and the
                        Nuclear Regulatory Commission should be consulted to judge the acceptability
                        of the agreement.</p>

                        basis.</p>
                    <p>3. United States and Soviet negotiators have completed an ad referendum text
                        of an agreement governing underground nuclear explosions for peaceful
                        purposes (<gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>). This agreement was
                        mandated by the treaty on the limitation of underground nuclear weapon tests
                        (the “Threshold” Test Ban Treaty, or TTBT) signed on July 3, 1974. The ad
                        referendum text has been submitted to the respective governments for final
                        approval before signature.</p>
                    <p>4. As negotiated, the agreement consists of a treaty, a protocol to the
                        treaty, and an agreed statement which delineates certain important
                        activities that are not contemplated by the term “peaceful application,” as
                        used in the treaty.</p>
                    <p>5. The provisions of these three documents fully complement the provisions of
                        the TTBT and thereby establish a comprehensive system of provisions
                        governing underground nuclear explosions of the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. The TTBT
                        will govern explosions at specified weapon test sites, and all such
                        explosions are considered to be nuclear weapon tests. The <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> treaty governs all other underground
                        nuclear explosions, which are permitted only for peaceful purposes, wherever
                        conducted outside the weapon test sites.</p>
                    <p>6. The <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> treaty limits the yield of
                        individual explosions to 150 kilotons. By specifying the same threshold as
                        the TTBT, the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> treaty <pb n="616"
                            facs="0650" xml:id="pg_616"/>recognizes the fact that it has not been
                        possible to distinguish between nuclear explosive device technology as
                        applied for weapons-related purposes and for peaceful purposes. The parties
                        devoted considerable effort to an investigation of whether it would be
                        possible to accommodate individual explosions with yields greater than 150
                        kilotons under the treaty, consistent with the agreed aim that
                        weapons-related benefits precluded by the TTBT should not be derived from
                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss>. The yield threshold for
                        individual explosions is a recognition that no means of making such an
                        accommodation has been discovered.</p>
                    <p>7. The treaty defines a category of explosions called “group” explosions; a
                        group consists of several individual explosions in sufficiently close
                        proximity in distance and time that teleseismic means cannot reliably
                        distinguish and measure the yields of the individual explosions in the
                        group. The aggregate yield of a group cannot exceed 1500 kilotons, and, of
                        course, the yield of each individual explosion in the group must not exceed
                        150 kilotons.</p>
                    <p>8. For any group explosion whose planned aggregate yield exceeds 150
                        kilotons, in order to ensure that no individual explosion has a yield
                        exceeding 150 kilotons, the treaty provides that observers of the verifying
                        side will be permitted on-site, where they will have the unqualified right
                        to measure the yield of each individual explosion in the group by means of
                        electrical equipment that measures the velocity of propagation of the shock
                        wave in the close vicinity of the explosion. Thus the <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> treaty introduces a singular breakthrough
                        in arms control: For the first time the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss> has agreed to provisions allowing on-site observation on
                        their own territory.</p>
                    <p>9. When the planned yield of a group explosion is between 500 and 1500
                        kilotons, the observers will in addition have the unqualified right to
                        deploy a network of seismometers at the site to assist in detecting any
                        undeclared explosion that might be detonated under the cover of the <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>. For explosions having yields between 100
                        and 150 kilotons, observers will be present if the need for their presence
                        is mutually agreed to between the parties on the basis of available
                        information. Under these circumstances, their functions will be to confirm
                        geological and other information in order to assist in the teleseismic
                        determination of the yield of the explosion. Observers will also confirm the
                        geological and other information provided by the party carrying out the
                        explosion at higher aggregate yields.</p>
                    <p>10. This scaling of functions with the aggregate yield of an explosion
                        provides a level of verification proportional to the possibility of evasion
                        of the 150 kiloton limit on the yield of the individual explosion, as well
                        as a basic capability at all yields to confirm that the circumstances of the
                        explosion are consistent with the stated peaceful purposes. For example, the
                        possibility of a clandestinely emplaced explosive deto<pb n="617"
                            facs="0651" xml:id="pg_617"/>nated under the cover of a group explosion
                        with an aggregate yield of 500–1500 kilotons is greater than if the <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> is at a lower yield, and therefore, as
                        noted above, a local network of seismometers is provided for to help confirm
                        the absence of such explosion.</p>
                    <p>11. Below 100 kilotons, the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> treaty makes
                        no provision for observers, and verification will be on the basis of
                        national technical means supplemented by detailed data supplied to the
                        verifying side by the party carrying out the explosion. National technical
                        means, assisted by such data, will provide adequate assurance that
                        individual explosions having yields greater than 150 kilotons are not being
                        conducted.</p>
                    <p>12. There are a number of other important features of the <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> treaty, including the following:</p>
                    <p>(A) For any <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>, regardless of yield,
                        information is to be provided about the purpose, location, date, planned
                        yield, depth of burial, geology, number of explosives and their relative
                        locations, and about the specific features of the project which could
                        influence the determination of the yield beforehand; and the results of the
                        explosion must be provided afterwards. More extensive information provisions
                        are established for explosions of higher yields;</p>
                    <p>(B) Any underground nuclear explosion for peaceful purposes must be carried
                        out in a manner fully consistent with existing treaty obligations, in
                        particular with the provisions of the Limited Test Ban Treaty, which
                        prohibit underground nuclear explosions that cause radioactive debris to be
                        present outside the boundaries of the state in which the explosion was
                        carried out;</p>
                    <p>(C) A joint consultative commission is to be established to “promote the
                        objectives and implementation of the provisions” of the agreement; it will
                        provide a consultation forum where, for example, technical issues may be
                        discussed;</p>
                    <p>(D) Consideration of the question of carrying out individual explosions with
                        yields greater than 150 kilotons is expressly deferred to an unspecified
                        future time. It should be emphasized that the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> treaty (as noted above) prohibits such explosions and would
                        require amendment to provide for them;</p>
                    <p>(E) The inseparability of the TTBT and the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> treaty is further recognized by making identical the
                        duration of five years for both agreements, and by the provision that
                        neither party may withdraw from the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        treaty while the TTBT remains in force;</p>
                    <p>(F) The treaty will govern all underground nuclear explosions for peaceful
                        purposes that might be carried out by either the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> or the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> not only on
                        their own territories but also, consistent with Article V of the
                        Non-Proliferation Treaty, on the territories of third countries in the
                        future;</p>
                    <pb n="618" facs="0652" xml:id="pg_618"/>
                    <p>(G) The treaty provides for the development of mutually beneficial
                        cooperation in various areas related to <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNEs</gloss>, although no specific form of such cooperation has either
                        been discussed or agreed upon;</p>
                    <p>(H) Both parties have pledged to continue to fulfill their obligations under
                        Article V of the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>, to assist the <gloss
                            target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> with regard to the international
                        agreements and procedures referred to in this article, and to keep the
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> informed of the results of any
                        cooperative efforts that they develop.</p>
                    <p>13. The agreed statement specifies that a “peaceful application” of an
                        underground nuclear explosion does not include the development testing of
                        nuclear explosives. Nor would associating test facilities, instrumentation
                        or procedures with any explosion carried out under the treaty constitute a
                        “peaceful application.”</p>

                        From the standpoint of our overall relations with the Soviet Union, there
                        are advantages in Presidential signature of the agreement.</p>

                    <p>Considering the tense situation in southern and eastern Africa and the Middle
                        East, we may have to continue to make clear our opposition to Soviet
                        adventurism in coming months. Simultaneous reaffirmation that an alternative
                        to increasing confrontation with the United States exists could be useful in
                        terms of Soviet leadership perceptions. This is particularly the case given
                        the apparent current impasse in <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        negotiations and the lack of progress in <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1"
                            >MBFR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Past arms control agreements with the Soviets have been treated with
                        considerable fanfare; all previous treaties have been signed by the
                        President and given considerable publicity here. The Soviets wanted to see
                        the exchange of instruments of ratification of the <gloss target="#t_ABM_1"
                            >ABM</gloss> Protocol given some prominence, but in view of the Angola
                        situation we chose to handle it in the lowest possible key. A decision to
                        treat the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> agreement in a similar
                        fashion could reinforce the attitude we see reflected in recent Soviet
                        pronouncements on <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>–<gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> relations that in the election-year
                        atmosphere little can be accomplished with us. Should this perception
                        continue, it could fortify leadership reluctance to make concessions on
                        issues of dispute (Africa) or negotiation (<gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss>) in the months to come.</p>
                    <p>We believe that a high visibility signing coupled with a statement by you
                        reaffirming our interest in resolving differences with the Soviets by
                        negotiation would be well received domestically. Such a statement should
                        highlight the significance of the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        agreement in establishing, for the first time, the principle of on-site
                        observation. This agreement, as a most useful forward step in our efforts to
                        control nuclear proliferation and testing, should command broad support. We
                        expect it to be reviewed and initialled within about ten days and the
                        signature ceremony could be scheduled at any time after that.</p>

                    <p>1. Chemical Weapons (<gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>). Early in session
                        several Soviet allies blamed <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> for lack
                        of progress on <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>, particularly for inaction

                            >USSR</gloss> initiative pursuant to 1974 summit. Later Sweden said
                        joint initiative had “lost its credibility” and that <gloss

                        (especially Soviet bloc and Japanese draft conventions and non-aligned
                        working paper). Several other dels supported this view. At <gloss

                            <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> meetings with experts for week of

                    <p>2. After advance communication with SovDel, <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> April 13 delivered major statement reiterating view that
                        initial stage of phased <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> agreement should
                        cover all lethal agents rather than just highly toxic ones, and describing
                        alternative approaches to framing scope of phased <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss> limitations. Statement explored associated verification
                        problems in depth. It concluded with expression of willingness to pursue
                        “two-track” approach (i.e., further contacts with Soviets and concurrent
                        work on <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> by <gloss target="#t_CCD_1"
                            >CCD</gloss>). Well-received statement at minimum should reinforce <pb

                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> problems, and may serve to moderate

                        proposal. However, there will be need for follow-up during summer session
                        and, in particular, at July experts’ meeting (e.g., by providing working
                        paper on stockpile destruction verification forecast in statement. Moreover,
                        Italian Rep was told by <persName corresp="#p_RAA_2">Roshchin</persName>
                        that there was “nothing new” in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        presentation perhaps indicating Soviet desire to counter favorable impact of
                        statement. Japanese, Indian, and Argentine Reps have urged us to introduce
                        joint initiative as soon as possible.</p>
                    <p>3. Preparation for experts’ meeting will also have to take into account
                        recently introduced Japanese working paper on agents to be covered in
                        initial agreement and last year’s <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>
                        working paper on classification, both of which contain ideas on scope of
                        first phase agreement that are at variance with <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> view that such an agreement should cover all lethal <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> agents. In addition to considering various
                        proposals regarding questions of scope and definition, we would expect
                        experts’ meetings to concentrate on <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>
                        verification. Sweden, which introduced working paper on verification of
                            <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> stockpile destruction April 22, has
                        indicated desire to examine verification issues in depth, including ideas
                        contained in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> statement such as
                        technical exchange visits to chemical facilities. Interest in verification

                        working paper has put Soviets on defensive. At April 22 plenary <persName

                        verification provisions of Soviet bloc draft treaty and held that
                        supplementary measures, such as direct technical means of verification such
                        as soil sampling, could be performed by national control organs provided for

                        Soviets did not appear to make much headway in <gloss target="#t_CCD_1"
                            >CCD</gloss> with their proposal to ban new <gloss target="#t_MDW_1"
                            >MDW</gloss> and new systems of such weapons. Informal meetings with

                        request. Despite Soviet and <gloss target="#t_GDR_1">GDR</gloss> experts’
                        fairly creditable efforts at explanation of possible new weapon development,
                        meetings left Western delegations largely unsatisfied with answers to
                        questions that they (<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> included) had
                        raised regarding substance and definition of <gloss target="#t_MDW_1"
                            >MDW</gloss> proposal. (Secretariat’s unofficial summary of informal

                        content to it. Despite pervasive lack of support from West and non-aligned
                        indifference, Soviet investment is already so substantial as to render it
                        unlikely they will abandon <gloss target="#t_MDW_1">MDW</gloss> project. <pb

                        informal meetings with experts for summer session, although <gloss

                    <p>5. Procedural Matters. <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> proposal for
                        comprehensive review of <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> procedures
                        during 1976 prompted mixed reactions. Soviets were very skeptical of taking
                        initiative in this area, seeing review primarily as opportunity for
                        non-aligned to step up pressure for abolition of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss>-Soviet co-chairmanship. However, they expressed
                        willingness to cooperate with us in carrying out review and pressed for
                        close coordination before it begins (now anticipated in second half of
                        July). Non-aligned group appears sharply divided on procedural questions.
                        While some, particularly Sweden and Yugoslavia, took strong stands for
                        abolition of co-chairmanship, others, most prominently Nigeria, expressed
                        surprisingly conservative views in favor of retaining co-chairmanship unless
                        and until France (and China) indicated willingness to join if system were
                        changed. Interest of Western dels in replacing co-chairmanship has cooled
                        considerably as a result of their recent contacts with France, which
                        contacts have indicated little change in aloof French attitude toward <gloss
                            target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> (see septel). <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> proposal served useful purpose in eliciting statements
                        from several non-aligned endorsing existing rules, including especially
                        decision-making by consensus.</p>
                    <p>6. No formal action to implement proposed review was taken during spring
                        session as consequence of protracted consideration of organizational matters
                        for 1976. Committee reached early agreement on extensive schedule of
                        informal meetings focusing on specific topics (<gloss target="#t_EnMod_1"
                            >EnMod</gloss>, new weapons of mass destruction, <gloss
                            target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>),
                        which allayed pressures for development of fixed program of work and
                        “timetable” based on priorities established by <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1"
                            >UNGA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>7. Committee also agreed in principle to two procedural changes for 1976: a
                        slight expansion of <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> communiqués to
                        mention subjects discussed by speakers, and giving responsibility to
                        Secretariat, rather than co-chairmen, for drafting <gloss target="#t_CCD_1"
                            >CCD</gloss>’s report to <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss>.
                        Co-chairmen would nevertheless continue to sign and transmit report. The
                        non-aligned, however, held formal approval of these changes hostage to
                        agreement on a Mexican proposal for establishment of a permanent
                        subcommittee to negotiate texts of agreements. This proposal proved highly
                        contentious, with Soviets in particular stating vigorous opposition to idea,
                        which they regarded as effort to undermine co-chairmanship by radical
                        revision of <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> organization and operating
                        methods. <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and, to lesser degree, Western
                        delegations expressed opposition to permanent subcommittee, while indicating
                        willingness to agree to ad hoc working group on <gloss target="#t_EnMod_1"
                            >EnMod</gloss> during summer session. By end of spring session,
                        committee had failed to find formula acceptable to all <pb n="623"
                            facs="0657" xml:id="pg_623"/>concerned, and matter was deferred to
                        summer session. Imbroglio over creation of a subcommittee may have cooled
                        the interest of some delegations in seeking major changes in course of
                        comprehensive review. At same time, however, it may fuel criticism of the
                            <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> at the upcoming session of the ad

                        had in mind initial talks among the three depository states of the Moscow

                        idea forward, following its identification at the 25th Soviet Party Congress
                        as a main task;</p>
                    <p>—That the 1974 Soviet suggestion of bilateral talks remained on the table, as

                    <p>2. During my April 26 call on <gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss>
                        International Organizations Division head <persName corresp="#p_IV_1"
                            >Israelyan</persName>, the following exchange took place on <gloss
                            target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>3. I introduced the topic by noting that as I had understood him in our April
                        12 talk, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>
                        had stressed the importance of our two countries reaching some sort of
                        agreement on <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>. As I recalled it, he had
                        said that perhaps other nuclear weapons states might not be prepared at the
                        outset to join in, but it was important for <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> to agree. Since this seemed to depart somewhat from the
                        previous Soviet position that all nuclear weapons states participate in
                        bringing a <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> into force, I said I would
                        appreciate any comment <persName corresp="#p_IV_1">Israelyan</persName>
                        would care to make on the subject.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_IV_1">Israelyan</persName> (who seemed well-prepared
                        to discuss the matter) replied that there was a certain historical
                        background. The Soviet side had suggested the possibility of bilateral
                        agreement on a <gloss target="#t_CTBT_1">CTBT</gloss> to the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> in May 1974 at the summit. As he
                        understood it, the American side had responded that it was not ready.
                        Subsequently, <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> had alluded to
                        this exchange on July 21, 1974, in Warsaw, in connection with the Polish
                        National Holiday. (Later he called for and read the appropriate passage from
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s speech. Referring to
                        the recent TTBT agreement, <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>
                        had said we want to go even further and are ready to go further; in
                        particular, the Soviet Union was ready to conclude a <gloss
                            target="#t_CTBT_1">CTBT</gloss> agreement; it had not been possible to
                        reach agreement on this matter, but giving life to the Soviet proposal would
                        be a new contribution which would be generally welcomed, and, <persName
                            corresp="#p_IV_1">Israelyan</persName> continued, <persName
                            corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> had concluded “we hope the time
                        will come when agreement will be possible.”)</p>
                    <p>5. Then, <persName corresp="#p_IV_1">Israelyan</persName> went on, mainly on
                        the basis of the discussions at the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>
                        Review Conference in Geneva in 1974, where both sides were criticized for
                        lack of further progress, the Soviets decided to push the matter forward
                        with a new <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> proposal. The result was their
                            <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> resolution. Unfortunately, the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> was still not ready to negotiate in
                        accordance with <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> Resolution 3478.</p>
                    <pb n="625" facs="0659" xml:id="pg_625"/>
                    <p>6. The Soviets are now seeking new possibilities for moving this matter
                        along, <persName corresp="#p_IV_1">Israelyan</persName> continued. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> had named this as a major task at
                        the 25th Party Congress. Concerning <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2"
                            >Gromyko</persName>’s suggestion, <persName corresp="#p_IV_1"
                            >Israelyan</persName> understood on the basis of the report he had seen
                        that <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName> has raised the
                        possibility of moving the idea forward among the three depository states of
                        the Moscow Treaty, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, the <gloss

                            >UK</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>7. As <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> had said, the proposal
                        made in 1974 stands. His private opinion, <persName corresp="#p_IV_1"
                            >Israelyan</persName> noted, was that if the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> is interested it would be possible to start <gloss
                            target="#t_CTBT_1">CTBT</gloss> negotiations among the Soviet Union, the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and the British, having in mind
                        that they could be joined later by others. The question of when and how this
                        could be done remained, but as he understood it the Minister was not
                        excluding this possibility, merely suggesting beginning with the Moscow
                        Treaty depositories as a first step. The important thing was not to leave
                        the possibility of moving forward open forever.</p>
                    <p>8. I interjected that I had understood the Minister to say that others might
                        at some time see the advisability of participating. <persName
                            corresp="#p_IV_1">Israelyan</persName> merely reiterated that the <gloss
                            target="#t_CTBT_1">CTBT</gloss> had been named as one of the first arms
                        control talks at the 25th Congress. If you are interested, he said, I see a
                        real possibility of forward movement. He was not very optimistic about
                        prospects in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> ad hoc committee, he
                        said. The Soviets had taken their new proposal to the 30th <gloss
                            target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> without illusions about possible changes
                        in the attitudes of the Chinese “or even” the French, after not succeeding
                        in their approach to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> in 1974. They
                        would continue their initiative in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>,
                        however; frankly, they would take advantage of the mood in the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, where the world majority supports the
                        initiative. But, since the Party Congress had identified <gloss
                            target="#t_CTBT_1">CTBT</gloss> as a task to be implemented, they were
                        thinking of ways to move it practically, and one of the conclusions of the
                        Geneva Review Conference was that something had to be done, and the
                        non-aligned states were criticizing both our countries. Thus, the Soviets
                        are ready, he concluded, on condition that other nuclear nations are
                        too.</p>
                    <p>9. When I pointed out that, as he knew and I had told <persName
                            corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>, verification remained a very
                        important problem for us, <persName corresp="#p_IV_1">Israelyan</persName>
                        asked if we had received the document on national means of verification
                        submitted by the Swedes in the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss>. When I
                        replied that we had a report, but not the document, he said the Soviets did
                        not have it either, but that it might be a very important document, which
                        should be studied and might help to move verification matters forward.</p>
                    <p>10. When I recalled that the Soviets had not sent experts to the <gloss
                            target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> verification meeting, <persName
                            corresp="#p_IV_1">Israelyan</persName> said that the ad hoc committee
                        was to discuss a draft tabled by the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>,
                        and the Soviets did not favor parallel work in several fora. However, the
                        fact they had not sent <pb n="626" facs="0660" xml:id="pg_626"/>experts did
                        not mean they never would. The main idea he wished to convey was that the
                        Soviets are very much interested in implementing the <gloss
                            target="#t_CTBT_1">CTBT</gloss> concept in general. There can be
                        different approaches to a <gloss target="#t_CTBT_1">CTBT</gloss> with the
                        participation of all nuclear powers; <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2"
                            >Gromyko</persName> was expressing one idea for helping to reach this
                        goal.</p>
                    <p>11. When I asked again about verification, <persName corresp="#p_IV_1"
                            >Israelyan</persName> replied that our <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> experience indicates that if good will is there much is
                        possible. Certain treaties, for example on bacteriological weapons and mass
                        destruction weapons on the seabed, establish verification procedures which
                        are satisfactory at least to the Soviets, and these practices might be used
                        again. However, the Soviet approach is not rigid; verification is certainly
                        a problem to be discussed.</p>
                    <p>12. I noted that as I understood it the verification problem with regard to
                            <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> was concentrated in the area of
                        blasts of 20 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> repeat 20 <gloss
                            target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss> and below, where there was a real danger of
                        confusion with earthquakes and other seismic events. Thus, the problem band
                        was not excessively wide.</p>
                    <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_IV_1">Israelyan</persName> responded only that the
                        Soviet side would be grateful for a response, and especially a positive
                        response, concerning its suggestion. I promised to report our conversation
                        to Washington.</p>

                    <p>—The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> will draw no distinction between
                        “actual” and “design” yield with regard to the type of yield intended in the
                        Treaty.</p>
                    <p>—The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> will conduct nuclear weapons tests
                        in accordance with previous guidance contained in the Under Secretaries
                        Committee report on the second-half <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 76
                        test program and approved in <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss>
                        319—i.e., we will test at design yields up to 150 kilotons.</p>
                    <p>—As required by <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 319, the Under
                        Secretaries Committee testing policy should be revised in the next
                        semi-annual nuclear weapons test program review “to include recommended
                        measures to reduce the probability of yields in excess” of the
                        threshold.</p>
                    <p>In light of his previous discussion with the Soviets pursuant to <gloss
                            target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 256, Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> should review with the Soviets
                        the previous understanding and confirm the following points:</p>
                    <p>—Both sides will make every effort to comply fully with all provisions of the
                        Threshold Test Ban Treaty.</p>
                    <p>—As agreed in previous discussions, there are technical uncertainties
                        associated with predicting the precise yield of nuclear weapon <pb n="628"
                            facs="0662" xml:id="pg_628"/>tests. These uncertainties may result in
                        slight unintended breaches of the 150 kiloton threshold.</p>
                    <p>—We will testify during ratification hearings that we have discussed this
                        problem with the Soviets and agreed that:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>• One or two slight unintended breaches per year would not be considered
                            a violation of the Treaty.</p>
                        <p>• Such breaches would be cause for concern, however, and, at the request
                            of either party, would be the subject of consultations.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>—We will also testify that while we would not consider a slight,
                        unintentional breach a violation, we would carefully review each such breach
                        to ensure that it is not part of a general attempt to exceed the confines of
                        the Treaty.</p>
                    <p>In the course of this discussion, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1"
                            >Stoessel</persName> should not commit the <gloss target="#t_US_1"

                        permissible. He should conclude the discussion by reaffirming that all
                        aspects of this oral understanding will become a matter of public record
                        during our ratification hearings.</p>

                    <p>On May 28, 1976, President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Gerald R.

                        Treaty and Protocol on Underground Nuclear Explosions for Peaceful Purposes
                        at a 10 a.m. ceremony in the East Room at the White House. Before signing
                        the treaty, the President offered brief remarks:</p>
                    <p>“The treaty we are signing today is an historic milestone in the history of
                        arms control agreements. For the first time it provides for extensive
                        cooperative arrangements for onsite inspection and observation in monitoring
                        underground nuclear explosions.</p>
                    <p>“This means that the Soviet Union will allow American observers to witness
                        certain larger tests on their territory, and if we should have such a test,
                        we would reciprocate and allow Soviet observers here in order to verify at
                        firsthand that our control agreements are being adhered to.</p>
                    <p>“This accomplishment in agreeing to onsite observation demonstrates that our
                        two countries can soberly negotiate responsible and beneficial agreements
                        despite the difficulties of the challenge. The negotiations culminating in
                        this treaty raised very unique problems. The <pb n="629" facs="0663"
                            xml:id="pg_629"/>discussions were long and complex. But the result: Real
                        progress has been made in the field of arms control. A significant step has
                        been taken toward a more stable, peaceful world and a more constructive
                        relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>“The new treaty, together with the Threshold Test Ban Treaty, will govern the
                        conduct of every underground nuclear explosion for military or peaceful
                        purposes for both parties. The two treaties impose the same limit of 150
                        kilotons on all individual underground nuclear explosions.</p>
                    <p>“The ultimate purpose of the network of arms control agreements we have
                        already negotiated and which are currently being negotiated, is to bring
                        about a more peaceful world. Pushing back the shadow of nuclear war must be
                        our constant concern. That, indeed, is the underlying purpose of all of the
                        numerous agreements for constructive cooperation which our two countries
                        have concluded in recent years.</p>
                    <p>“I welcome the accomplishments we mark here today. And I hope it will lead to
                        further achievements in building a stable and a just peace for our two
                        peoples and for all mankind.</p>
                    <p>“I will send these two treaties to the Senate for the earliest possible
                        consideration and urge that the Senate grant its advice and consent to their
                        ratification.”</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> then signed the treaty, noting
                        that it and the Threshold Test Ban Treaty “will contribute significantly” to
                        peace and improved relations amongst all nations. Simultaneously, in Moscow
                        Soviet General Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Leonid
                            Brezhnev</persName> signed the treaty on behalf of the Soviet Union.

                        subsequently transmitted both the Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the Peaceful
                        Nuclear Explosions Treaty to the Senate for ratification on July 29. In his
                        message to the Senate transmitting the treaties, the President noted:</p>
                    <p>“The <gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss> Treaty and the <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> Treaty, taken together as integrated and
                        complementary components of this important limitation on nuclear explosions,
                        provide that very large yield nuclear explosions will no longer be carried
                        out by the Parties. This is one more useful step in our continuing efforts
                        to develop comprehensive and balanced limitations on nuclear weapons. We
                        will continue our efforts to reach an adequately verifiable agreement
                        banning all nuclear weapon testing, but in so doing we must ensure that
                        controls on peaceful nuclear explosions are consistent with such a ban.
                        These Treaties are in the national interest, and I respectfully recommend
                        that the Senate give its advice and consent to ratification.” (Ibid., Book

                        <salute>Dear Mr. President:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>I believe there is an opportunity and a need for the United States to take a
                        major initiative to resolve uncertainties that now exist in the nuclear fuel
                        cycle and to reduce the risk of international proliferation of special
                        nuclear materials. This opportunity, if successfully pursued, would complete
                        your evolving nuclear policy and could be the central feature of a major
                        Presidential Message.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background:</p>
                    <p>Until recently, Federal nuclear policy: (1) stressed Government funding of
                        enrichment plants; (2) assumed that reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel and
                        recycling of plutonium and uranium would be accomplished in the private
                        sector without Government support; and (3) placed less stress on safeguards
                        against theft or diversion of nuclear material than now seems wise.</p>
                    <p>Your initiatives in the past two years have substantially reformed this
                        policy. Specifically you have:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>• Limited the Federal role in enrichment by supporting private entry as
                            the best means for assuring additional enrichment capacity;</p>
                        <p>• Increased Government research in reprocessing and recycling so that
                            safe and secure private facilities could be demonstrated;</p>
                        <p>• Sponsored a major Government program to demonstrate the safe management
                            and disposal of nuclear waste; and</p>
                        <p>• Increased stress on materials and physical safeguards at both
                            Government-owned and private facilities licensed by the Nuclear
                            Regulatory Commission.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>These measures will greatly strengthen the nuclear fuel cycle and our
                        controls over the handling and utilization of plutonium in this country.
                        Yet, despite substantial progress, a final and crucial issue remains
                        unresolved—the need to control carefully the world’s supply of plutonium.
                        Among the factors bearing on this issue are:</p>
                    <pb n="631" facs="0665" xml:id="pg_631"/>
                    <quote>
                        <p>• A recent court decision most likely will prevent the Nuclear Regulatory
                            Commission from licensing private reprocessing facilities that would
                            produce plutonium for recycled use until approval of the generic
                            environmental statement on mixed oxide fuels, probably years from
                            now.</p>
                        <p>• Uncertainty is growing among other nations about the United States as a
                            reliable supplier of reactors and fuel because of (1) final decisions on
                            export licenses now rest with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; and (2)
                            recent amendments to nuclear legislation indicating firm Congressional
                            intent to review individual nuclear initiatives with the private
                            sector.</p>
                        <p>• Other supplier nations are developing national reprocessing and
                            recycling capabilities, and some are under pressure commercially to sell
                            plants to other countries desiring to build an integrated indigenous
                            nuclear power capability, for example, Iran and Brazil. This trend could
                            multiply the chances of theft or diversion of plutonium and could lead
                            to a dramatic increase in the number of nations with nuclear
                            weapons.</p>
                        <p>• Multinational regional reprocessing centers have been suggested as a
                            means for minimizing this proliferation. However, the technical,
                            logistical and political feasibility of the idea has yet to be
                            demonstrated.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation:</p>
                    <p>I believe the time is at hand for the United States to address this basic
                        issue with a major initiative. Such an initiative might have the following
                        features:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>• An offer to supplier and consumer states to join with the United States
                            to demonstrate the viability of a multinational reprocessing approach
                            using the United States as the demonstration site. The question of
                            excess plutonium and disposal of nuclear waste resulting from the
                            reprocessing requires further exploration to optimize the attractiveness
                            to both the host and participating nations.</p>
                        <p>• A call upon supplier nations to suspend temporarily the export of
                            reprocessing technology until the multinational centers or other
                            effective controls have been agreed to. I have already suggested this to
                            the Secretary of State in a letter dated May 13, 1976.</p>
                        <p>• A commitment to employ in the multinational centers and to make
                            available advanced United States safeguards and security technology.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>The key to the initiative is a willingness of the United States to offer
                        reprocessing and recycling services to other nations and to open our
                        facilities to international inspection. The facility could well be a new
                        plant or a partially completed private plant at Barnwell, South Carolina
                        that was financed by a consortium composed of Allied Chemical, Gulf Oil
                        Corporation and Royal Dutch Shell. Arrangements for serving foreign needs
                        from this facility would, of course, have to be worked out, however, it is
                        anticipated that the consortium will have an interest in a
                        governmentally-encouraged demonstration.</p>
                    <p>In any event, the United States could provide some funding and appropriate
                        technical assistance and guarantees for the establishment <pb n="632"
                            facs="0666" xml:id="pg_632"/>of an international reprocessing facility
                        in the United States and invite those nations which would utilize the
                        services of such a facility to provide a pro rata share of operating
                        expenses. Of course, a successful international demonstration, under the
                        auspices of the United States, would also materially assist in the
                        development of our domestic reprocessing capability over the long run as
                        increasing nuclear power production results in needed new reprocessing
                        facilities. Such an initiative could become the centerpiece of a truly
                        comprehensive Presidential policy on nuclear power and
                        non-proliferation.</p>

                    <p>If you approve, I will pursue and intensify work with appropriate departments

                    <p>The summer session of the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> is scheduled
                        to open June 22, and we will hold bilateral discussions with the Soviets
                        prior to that. The main subject of the summer session will be the
                        negotiation of the ENMOD treaty. Our discussions with the Soviets will focus
                        on what <pb n="633" facs="0667" xml:id="pg_633"/>modifications to the joint
                        draft—which we tabled last year—might be acceptable in order to obtain the
                        support of the other <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss> members.</p>
                    <p>During our preparation for these discussions, <gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                            >DOD</gloss> expressed a serious reservation about the legal character
                        of the draft treaty, even in its present form. According to the <gloss
                            target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> communication to you (Tab B), there is a
                        dilemma represented by the ENMOD treaty because it encompasses both arms
                        control and law of wars issues and attempts to treat them together in regard
                        to the regulation of obligations undertaken by parties to the treaty. In
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>’s view this situation could lead to
                        confusion and could impact on the negotiation of future treaties, as well as
                        on the present ENMOD deliberations.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> recommends that a special interagency
                        legal review be made of the issues they perceive, before proceeding further
                        with substantive ENMOD negotiations. The lawyers at State and <gloss
                            target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> have reviewed the concerns expressed by
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> and find them to be almost
                        incomprehensible. They are also uncertain as to what <gloss
                            target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> intends in the way of an alteration to our
                        already-tabled draft ENMOD treaty. (It should be noted that none of these
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> concerns were expressed in the
                        original study that lead to the President approving our ENMOD treaty
                        proposal.) However, inasmuch as <persName corresp="#p_WJP_1">Jim
                            Wade</persName> indicates that these concerns are strongly held at the
                        highest level in <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>, it would seem best to
                        accede to their request for a rapid interagency assessment of the issues
                        that they have raised. A study directive is at Tab A.</p>

                            corresp="#p_SRC_1">Seamans</persName> has recommended (letter at Tab A)
                        undertaking a major program to provide nuclear fuel reprocessing in the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, permitting foreign participation
                        in this activity, and using this program as the centerpiece of a major
                        Presidential statement on non-proliferation.</p>
                    <p>The problem of weapons proliferation—because of greater availability of
                        plutonium from commercial nuclear power plants—is gaining steadily
                        increasing attention in the Congress, the media, and in the public. There
                        are growing concerns that current <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        activities to safeguard against diversion of materials from <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> exports are inadequate. Additional
                        attention will be focused on potential proliferation problems when
                        controversy within the Nuclear Regulatory Commission over exports to Spain
                        and India becomes public next week.</p>
                    <p>We agree that the time has come for considering new initiatives and,
                        probably, for a major Presidential statement on nuclear export policy and
                        perhaps on nuclear energy. However, we also believe that other aspects of
                        the problem leading to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SRC_1">Seamans</persName>’s
                        letter need to be considered and that other proposals should also be
                        evaluated as part of a complete response to the current situation.</p>

                    <p>In view of the complex nature of the issues involved, covering both domestic
                        and foreign policy interests, a number of agencies will need to be involved
                        in developing and evaluating possible initiatives and in drafting a proposed

                    <p>2. That you tentatively decide to issue a statement or send a message to

                        evaluation of possible initiatives, it could be limited to nuclear exports
                        and non-proliferation or a more general nuclear statement.</p>
                    <p>3. That you assign responsibility jointly to us (<persName corresp="#p_SBA_1"

                        (i.e., referred to as reprocessing). Concern has continued to grow since

                    <p>Attention is now focused on exports of nuclear materials and equipment. Some

                    <p>The independent <gloss target="#t_NRC_1">NRC</gloss> now plays a major role
                        in nuclear exports and will attract considerable attention to the
                        international safeguards issue soon.</p>
                    <p>1. Inadvertently, the final responsibility for approving nuclear exports was
                        allowed to be vested in the independent <gloss target="#t_NRC_1">NRC</gloss>
                        rather than the Executive Branch. This resulted from the September 1974 law
                        which created <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_NRC_1">NRC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>2. The <gloss target="#t_NRC_1">NRC</gloss> now has before it for approval
                        proposed licenses to export additional fuel for reactors in Spain and India.
                        There appears to be agreement within <gloss target="#t_NRC_1">NRC</gloss>
                        that additional controls are needed, but there is sharp dispute as to
                        whether additional controls—beyond those <pb n="638" facs="0672"
                            xml:id="pg_638"/>in existing agreements—should not be imposed as a
                        condition of the exports. The Commission decision apparently will be
                        accompanied by written opinion, making public the strong views of one
                        commissioner that safeguards in some agreements for cooperation and <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> vigilance have not been adequate.</p>
                    <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Congressional</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Congress is asking more questions and tightening controls which will
                        introduce delays and uncertainties. Examples include:</p>
                    <p>1. In 1974, a law was enacted requiring that all future bilateral “agreements
                        for cooperation” involving significant nuclear exports be submitted to the
                        Congress for a 60-day period of review.</p>
                    <p>2. Senate Government Operations Committee recently reported a bill (S. 1439)
                        which (a) shifts additional Executive Branch nuclear export responsibility
                        to State Department and the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission from
                            <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss> and Commerce Department, and (b)
                        makes the Congress the referee in disputes between State and <gloss
                            target="#t_NRC_1">NRC</gloss>. Bill referred to <gloss
                            target="#t_JCAE_1">JCAE</gloss> and Foreign Relations for 60 days. It
                        could come to a vote this session.</p>
                    <p>3. The Senate version of the Military Aid Bill includes a prohibition (the
                            “<persName corresp="#p_SWS_1">Symington</persName> Amendment”) against
                        military assistance to countries which furnish or receive nuclear
                        reprocessing or enrichment facilities not under multinational control and
                        which do not have <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards on all
                        nuclear facilities. House-Senate Conferees agreed on June 16 to accept the
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWS_1">Symington</persName> Amendment with a
                        proviso that restrictions could be waived in specific cases upon a finding
                        by the President of overriding national interest, but Congress would then
                        have an opportunity to disapprove.</p>
                    <p>4. The <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss> 1977 Authorization Bill was
                        amended on the House floor to provide for congressional review of the first
                        export to any nation that is neither a signer of the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> nor covered by any agreement for
                        cooperation approved by the Congress under the provisions of the 1974 law
                        listed above.</p>
                    <p>5. A House International Relations Subcommittee (<persName corresp="#p_ZC_1"
                            >Zablocki</persName>) held hearings on June 10 on an amendment to the
                        Export Administration Act designed to prohibit nuclear exports unless
                        safeguards are tightened.</p>
                    <p>6. Senator <persName corresp="#p_RAA_1">Ribicoff</persName> is asking hard
                        questions of the State Department as to whether (a) any <gloss

                        the plutonium used in the device exploded in 1974, and (b) why the <gloss

                        event. This whole issue will get even more attention as <gloss

                        actions (a) have been piecemeal and largely defensive, and (b) appear

                    <p>Several ideas have surfaced for possible additional responses to the current

                    </p>
                    <p>There appears to be divided views on this. Some probably will argue that past

                        doing, recognizing the threat. Steps that might be considered to achieve a
                        harder and consistent policy include:</p>
                    <p>1. Strong public message to other supplier nations (France and Germany)
                        emphasizing the need to curb proliferation and urging them to (a) stop
                        supplying reprocessing or enrichment technology to other nations, and (b)
                        adopting more rigorous safeguards requirements.</p>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Hello,
                        Chuck.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: Welcome back.</p>
                    <p>We have an effort going forward under White House supervision—the mechanics
                        on nuclear proliferation, nuclear policy.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Where?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: We have a paper for the
                        press in September. We have a man on the task force. But I have recommended
                        to you that we set up our own task force within the Department—</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Absolutely.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: —to follow this thing
                        carefully.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I thought we had
                        this thing already. I thought we were doing our internal study on that. Win,
                        you and I talked about this.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: Yes. We had some
                        preliminary work, but Chuck wants to formalize.</p>
                    <pb n="642" facs="0676" xml:id="pg_642"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Just don’t give
                        me one of those papers with ten endorsements on it. It doesn’t mean a goddam
                        thing. We have to have it under somebody’s control.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: Hal Sonnenfeldt, and
                        all of them.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But they
                        shouldn’t spend time changing language. If anyone doesn’t like a prevailing
                        opinion, let him put down his views separately.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: We’ll go ahead with
                        that.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. Can we have
                        a paper in three days?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: We’ll try to.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s better,
                        when we all know the basic element. Don’t repeat just by rote all the
                        reprocessing arguments because I frankly am developing the most serious
                        doubts about the multilateral reprocessing, which is an article of religion
                        here. I mean, you put them down but look at the other.</p>
                    <p>I don’t see why multilateral reprocessing in those areas is better than
                        bilateral reprocessing—if there’s to be any reprocessing—and when we get
                        into the Iranian-Pakistan Cooperative Agreement, I’ll be damned if I see why
                        a joint Iranian-Pakistani one is better than an Iranian-<gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> or Pakistani-<gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> one.</p>
                    <p>The key thing is to have a supply. That I have no problem with.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: Well, we’ll keep you
                        advised of how it’s coming along.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I don’t have a
                        problem—that’s essential, but I’d rather have the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss>, together with one of these countries, than Germany or
                        France—who have no leverage at all when the violations begin. If you have a
                        European consortium, they have even less leverage. You have the Dutch,
                        together with the Swiss, and somebody else. What can they do when their
                        safeguards are disregarded? You’re going to make policy recommendations too
                        in the paper?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: In this paper, yes—to
                        you.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The quicker the
                        better.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: We should act.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No—I’m strongly
                        for it.</p>

                    <p>On July 4 and 29, the Soviets conducted underground nuclear explosions which
                        may have exceeded the 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss> yield limit on
                        individual explosions under the TTB/PNE treaties. Our <hi rend="italic"
                            >preliminary</hi> analysis on these tests is as follows:</p>
                    <p>—The <hi rend="italic">July 4 test</hi> was located at the Semipalatinsk
                        nuclear weapons test site and is currently assessed as having occurred in
                        hard rock with a yield range of [<hi rend="italic">number not
                            declassified</hi>] with a most probable value of [<hi rend="italic"
                            >number not declassified</hi>]. However, if our location of the
                        epicenter is off by one or two kilometers, the test would have occurred in
                        looser, sedimentary rock which does not couple as well to the explosion. In
                        this case the range of possible values would be [<hi rend="italic">number
                            not declassified</hi>] with a most probable value of [<hi rend="italic"
                            >number not declassified</hi>]. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] should be available this weekend and should help us
                        precisely locate the epicenter.</p>
                    <p>—The <hi rend="italic">July 29 explosion</hi> was apparently at least in part
                        a <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> experiment to create a large cavity
                        which could be used for storage of petrochemicals or other products. It
                        occurred in a salt deposit (which is the best material for creating
                        free-standing cavities) and has a preliminary yield range of [<hi
                            rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>] with a most probable value
                        of [<hi rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>]. Our knowledge of the
                        coupling of nuclear explosions in salt is highly uncertain, however, and the
                        range may be lower.</p>
                    <p>As you know, even though the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> Treaty was
                        signed on May 28 and forwarded with the <gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss>
                        Treaty to the Senate for ratification purposes on July 29, they are not

                        Treaty, the Soviets announced (Tab A) that they would not “take any actions
                        incompatible with the provisions of the treaty,” and we announced that we
                        had no plans for the immediate future to conduct weapons tests with yields
                        greater than 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">kt</gloss> (Tab B). These
                        statements were necessary since the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        negotiations had not been completed, and we had stated that agreement would
                        have to be reached in this area before the <gloss target="#t_TTB_1"
                            >TTB</gloss> Treaty could take effect. The Soviet statement was
                        effectively open-ended, whereas ours referred to “the immediate future” to
                        pressure the Soviets to make progress in the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss> talks.</p>
                    <p>We will not be able to complete a final estimate of the yield of these two
                        tests for several weeks—in some cases it has taken sixty days just to
                        receive the seismic tapes from our far-flung monitoring stations. [<hi

                            target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> parties or countries accepting full
                        safeguards and with countries prepared to forego or restructure their
                        reprocessing options. We also support an approach which makes a clear
                        distinction between (1) cooperation under new and amended agreements and (2)
                        cooperation under existing agreements. For both categories of recipients we
                        would underscore the general need for a <hi rend="italic">multilateral</hi>
                        approach. <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> leadership in
                        non-proliferation is important and consistent with our past policies and
                        recent initiatives in forming the London Suppliers’ Group. But excessively
                        stringent or rigid unilateral <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policies
                        will at best have limited benefits, since we no longer dominate the
                        international nuclear market and will not be able to obtain new restraints
                        without concerted supplier actions.</p>
                    <p>On the more specific restraint recommendations:</p>
                    <p>—For negotiating <hi rend="italic">new or amended</hi>
                        <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> nuclear cooperation agreements, we
                        strongly support the recommendation that the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> apply these restraints as <hi rend="italic">nonbinding
                            criteria</hi> for engaging in new or expanded nuclear cooperation. We
                        should recognize, however, the importance of gaining common supplier
                        policies on these restraints, and be prepared to state that we will apply
                        them as <hi rend="italic">conditions</hi> as soon as other <pb n="647"
                            facs="0681" xml:id="pg_647"/>suppliers agree to do the same. The
                        President’s public statement would make this basic approach explicit. We
                        support the review group’s conclusion that new restraints should <hi
                            rend="italic">not</hi> be mandatory requirements in the absence of
                        multilateral agreement. (In this connection, the options on “retroactive
                        sanctions” must be seen as possible elements of a legislative strategy that
                        must be accomplished in coordination with the Congress.) Even with a
                        Presidential override, such a unilateral policy could impair our flexibility
                        in pursuing non-proliferation objectives with specific suppliers and
                        recipients.</p>
                    <p>—For cooperation under <hi rend="italic">existing agreements</hi>, we
                        strongly <hi rend="italic">endorse</hi> the proposal to use diplomacy and a
                        strategy of inducements to persuade the many key target countries in this
                        category to voluntarily renegotiate existing agreements with new restraints.
                        In addition, in connection with our attempts to find an acceptable
                        compromise with the <gloss target="#t_JCAE_1">JCAE</gloss> on its Nuclear
                        Export Bill, we see merit in the recommendation that <gloss
                            target="#t_NRC_1">NRC</gloss> use the agreed London Supplier Guidelines
                        as <hi rend="italic">criteria</hi> in granting export licenses under
                        existing agreements. But even with the proposed Presidential override, we
                        are concerned that such an approach could be viewed as an attempt by the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to impose these guidelines
                        retroactively, to the detriment of our relations with a number of major
                        allies and our overall credibility as a supplier. Finally, we <hi
                            rend="italic">oppose</hi> the imposition of new restraints as a <hi
                            rend="italic">condition</hi> of further <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> supply until common supplier agreement is achieved on this
                        point. Even then, such a course of action would contravene the legal terms
                        of our international agreements, thereby risking adverse legal, foreign
                        policy, and even non-proliferation consequences.</p>
                    <p>As a fundamental point for recipients in both categories, we would emphasize
                        the vital link between <hi rend="italic">gaining new restraints</hi> and <hi
                            rend="italic">offering attractive inducements</hi> through fuel buy-back
                        and exchange, and possible leasing. All such inducements should be <hi
                            rend="italic">coordinated with other suppliers</hi>, since uncoordinated
                        inducements may look to other suppliers as a <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> attempt to preempt a larger share of nuclear fuel and
                        related reactor markets. In particular, the more attractive and reliable we
                        make our enriched uranium supply using existing and planned facilities
                        within the broad framework of the Nuclear Fuel Assurances Act, the more
                        success we will have in obtaining effective restraints on reprocessing. The
                        President’s public statement should relate inducements to restraints to the
                        degree of specificity judged feasible in light of our ability to consider
                        offering new fuel supply or service arrangements. These issues are discussed
                        further below in the context of our recommendations regarding alternatives
                        to national reprocessing.</p>
                    <p>In general, nuclear consumers will become less disposed to relying on the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> if we arbitrarily impose more
                        stringent conditions on nuclear agreements after their terms have been
                        mutually agreed. <hi rend="italic">We must there<pb n="648" facs="0682"
                                xml:id="pg_648"/>fore ensure that the <gloss target="#t_NRC_1"
                                >NRC</gloss> licensing procedures are responsive to national
                            policy</hi> as executed by the President, within legislative
                        requirements. Nuclear export licenses should not be used as a lever for
                        obtaining new constraints from countries which live up to their obligations
                        to us. <gloss target="#t_NRC_1">NRC</gloss> procedures should be perceived
                        instead as a means of predictably implementing our policies of providing
                        inducements, such as guaranteed reactor fuel supply, for countries accepting
                        effective non-proliferation constraints.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Alternatives to National Reprocessing</hi>. The

                        the need for strong and specific <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        initiatives to achieve an international fuel-exchange regime based upon:</p>
                    <p>—inducements for <hi rend="italic">recipients</hi>, in the form of assured
                        and equitable front-end fuel services in exchange for their spent fuel;

                    <p>—inducements for <hi rend="italic">suppliers</hi>, in the form of joint
                        fuel-service support for reactor sales in non-nuclear weapon states, in
                        exchange for withholding sensitive nuclear technology from further spread
                        under national control.</p>
                    <p>The Department supports the steps recommended to further these objectives.
                        However, <hi rend="italic">we further recommend that the President call for
                            the exploration by interested nations of an “international nuclear fuel
                            bank”</hi> concept, through which the potential <hi rend="italic"
                            >benefits</hi> of plutonium recycle would be shared under international
                        controls, while the reprocessing <hi rend="italic">activities</hi>
                        incidental to achieving those benefits would be confined, initially to a few
                        major supplier countries, but eventually include a few carefully sited
                        multinational plants. The Department has developed further proposals for
                        making significant forward movement in establishing an effective fuel
                        exchange regime. These proposals are consistent with but go further than the
                        review group’s recommendations in relating restraint requirements to fuel
                        inducements. <hi rend="italic">With the President’s approval, the following
                            approaches would be integrated into the fuel-exchange elements already
                            presented in the nuclear policy report</hi>.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">As a matter of national policy</hi>, the President would
                        express:</p>

                            restraints,</hi> notably no national reprocessing and enrichment

                    <p>(ii) For <hi rend="italic">recipients who do not agree to renounce national

                        fuel. All suppliers would be urged to offer such options.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">To lend multilateral impetus</hi> to the foregoing
                        arrangements, the President would express publicly <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> readiness to explore with interested supplier nations
                        possible arrangements for pooling fuel-exchange capabilities through such
                        means as tie-in fuel sales, cross-investment in enrichment and reprocessing
                        facilities, joint enrichment and reprocessing facilities, joint enrichment
                        guarantees, spent fuel storage as needed to support such arrangements, and
                        an eventual international fuel bank.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the Department supports the review group’s recommendations for
                        strengthened fuel assurances, increased enrichment capacity which could
                        support fuel exchange arrangements, and an appeal for passage of the NFAA as
                        an essential ingredient in our non-proliferation strategy. It strongly
                        supports strengthened high-level diplomatic approaches to other supplier
                        governments, on a confidential basis in the first instance, seeking a
                        one-to-two year moratorium on exports of sensitive facilities and pursuing
                        possible fuel pooling arrangements as a means of minimizing commercial
                        competition in fuel cycle services.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Domestic Reprocessing Options</hi>. The Department is
                        not in a position to make a comprehensive judgment on the <hi rend="italic"
                            >domestic</hi> benefits of the various reprocessing options presented in
                        the report. As the report notes, the economic benefits of domestic
                        reprocessing are uncertain and possibly marginal.</p>
                    <p>From the point of view of our international and non-proliferation interests,
                        domestic decisions on reprocessing and recycle may have an important impact
                        in two respects:</p>
                    <p>—A <hi rend="italic">perception</hi> internationally that the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has taken a decisive step toward plutonium
                        recycle may make national reprocessing appear both more respectable and more
                        economically attractive. We could argue that such a step is justified
                        because of the size of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> nuclear
                        program, but it is not clear whether this would overcome such perceptions,
                        particularly when announced as a Presidential initiative.</p>
                    <p>—The possession or lack of a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        reprocessing <hi rend="italic">capability</hi> may have an important effect
                        on our ability to negotiate workable joint fuel-exchange arrangements with
                        other suppliers.</p>
                    <p>Negative international perceptions could probably be reduced to an acceptable
                        level if the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> were to begin a <hi
                            rend="italic">limited</hi> program, but only if its size, substance, and
                        rationale were consistent with a larger <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        non-proliferation program which received general international credence. In
                        sum, our domestic and international choices must be part of an integrated
                        whole.</p>
                    <pb n="650" facs="0684" xml:id="pg_650"/>
                    <p>Provided that an international policy along the lines we have recommended is
                        also adopted, the <hi rend="italic">Department can support adoption of
                            Option 1</hi>, to “assist industry to gain experience with
                        reprocessing,” <hi rend="italic">with certain modifications</hi>, along the
                        following lines:</p>
                    <p>—The program should be identified from the outset as <hi rend="italic"
                            >experimental</hi> in nature without prejudging its outcome, and its
                        content should justify this description;</p>
                    <p>—We do not object to a demonstration project as proposed, consisting of
                        government support for the AGNS plant plus design of a larger plant with no
                        near-term commitment to construct this second facility;</p>
                    <p>—The possibility of substantial Government involvement in any second plant
                        should, however, be held open;</p>
                    <p>—There should be aggressive pursuit of alternative technologies to
                        reprocessing and recycle as an element of the program;</p>
                    <p>—The program should explicitly allow for financial participation by other
                        nations (both suppliers and consumers) and joint exploration of service
                        arrangements, but should specifically exclude service commitments or
                        technology transfers except as part of agreed arrangements among
                        suppliers.</p>
                    <p>—The program should be presented as an integral part of our overall strategy,
                        with emphasis upon its potential role in improving safeguards, supporting
                        joint fuel-exchange arrangements, developing alternative technologies, and
                        possibly as a future element of an international fuel bank.</p>
                    <p>—The program should be reviewed at the end of two years to assess the
                        economic and technological benefits of reprocessing in the light of what has
                        been learned, and the advisability of proceeding with construction of a
                        plant beyond AGNS, in the light of progress made toward an international
                        fuel-exchange regime.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Strengthened Sanctions</hi>. We support a publicly
                        articulated sanctions policy along the lines proposed as a means of
                        balancing our non-proliferation and overall foreign policy objectives. The
                        proposed approach includes at least automatic cut-off of <gloss

                        stresses the need for consultations among suppliers and consumers to
                        determine what collective actions should be taken. We do <hi rend="italic"
                            >not</hi> believe that a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy
                        should go further than these steps, either in terms of incorporating
                        explicit non-nuclear responses or in terms of adopting more rigid unilateral
                        policies.</p>
                    <p>The Department will consult in advance of a public statement with other
                        countries, and in particular seek to elicit comparable statements from other
                        key suppliers. We will also pursue diplomatic efforts to <pb n="651"

                        and seek supplier agreement to curtail nuclear cooperation with any
                        non-nuclear weapons state hereafter testing a nuclear device, regardless of
                        whether safeguards obligations are violated (recognizing that it is unlikely
                        that France would agree).</p>

                        such a statement with key suppliers and the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1"
                            >IAEA</gloss> Director General. In both public statements and private
                        consultations, when discussing the role of such a storage regime for <hi
                            rend="italic">separated plutonium</hi>, we should be wary of appearing
                        to condone national reprocessing.</p>
                    <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Strengthened <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>
                            Safeguards</hi>. We support the proposed program to sponsor safeguards
                        demonstrations for sensitive facilities, offer an <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1"
                            >ERDA</gloss> laboratory to support development of new techniques, and
                        explore possibilities for greater <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        contributions to improving agency capabilities. The Department is prepared
                        to seek cooperation from other suppliers and recipients in reinforcing our
                        initiatives, and believes that a public statement surfacing these proposals
                        would be useful in this connection.</p>
                    <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Strengthened Physical Security</hi>. We support a policy
                        of strengthening and standardizing physical security over nuclear materials.
                        We have made significant progress in establishing physical security
                        guidelines for suppliers to follow as result of the London Suppliers’
                        understandings. Before going beyond these agreed standards, the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> should first seek to bring its own
                        national standards up to these levels. The concept of an international
                        convention—which has been proposed internationally in 1974 and again in 1975
                        in the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> and explored diplomatically
                        with other suppliers and in the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>
                        context—could be mentioned as part of an overall nuclear policy statement.
                        But it should be recognized that the prospects for strong mandatory
                        provisions as well as early negotiation of such a convention are
                        limited.</p>
                    <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Waste Management</hi>. We support the review group’s
                        recommendations on waste management, but further recommend that the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> publicly propose the pursuit of
                        international <gloss target="#t_RD_1">R&amp;D</gloss> initiatives in this
                        field. We also propose that specific attention be given to the question of
                        whether the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> could accept foreign waste,
                        if we ever entered into an international reprocessing service program.</p>
                    <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Non-Nuclear Technologies</hi>. The Department supports
                        these proposals and will work with <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss> in
                        studying possibilities. However, <pb n="652" facs="0686" xml:id="pg_652"/>we
                        do not see substantial opportunities emerging which could provide an
                        effective near-term deterrent to smaller countries desiring to obtain
                        nuclear power plants. In the proper context, on the other hand, initiatives
                        in non-nuclear energy cooperation may be helpful in dissuading certain
                        countries from acquiring <hi rend="italic">sensitive</hi> nuclear
                        facilities, such as reprocessing plants. In formulating and implementing any
                        such program, we should draw upon the efforts we are making in the IEA and
                        in CIEC to cooperate with <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDCs</gloss> in the
                        energy field. Of particular importance might be the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> proposal for an International Energy Institute which we
                        are discussing within the IEA and CIEC, following up the various proposals
                        we made at the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Seventh Special
                        Session.</p>
                    <p>10. <hi rend="italic">
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Safeguards Effectiveness</hi>. We
                        support the proposals for assuring the effectiveness of <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> safeguards, with the understanding that
                        upgraded intelligence efforts should be responsive to our broader
                        non-proliferation policy needs and not injurious to the <gloss
                            target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>. We would also seek other supplier
                        support for fallback bilateral safeguards and work with them to gain
                        timelier access to <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards
                        information.</p>
                    <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Public Statement</hi>. The Department does not believe
                        that the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> would be an appropriate
                        forum to discuss new non-proliferation policies emphasizing tougher
                        constraints. While the drama and worldwide scope of a Presidential <gloss
                            target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> address are positive factors, such a
                        message would likely be attacked as restrictive and discriminatory by the
                        less developed countries, even if balanced by offers of inducements. On the
                        other hand, a domestic message, perhaps to the Congress, would present an
                        opportunity to underline both the safeguards and constraints inherent in our
                        nuclear policies and the experimental character of any domestic reprocessing
                        program. If the President nonetheless selects the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1"
                            >UNGA</gloss> as the forum for a statement on nuclear policy, the
                        Department would recommend that he emphasize the cooperative aspects of our
                        non-proliferation policy.</p>
                    <p>12. <hi rend="italic">Nuclear Policy Organization</hi>. Rather than the
                        proposed Nuclear Policy Council including State, <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1"
                            >ERDA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss>, we believe
                        that consideration should be given to continuation of the existing NSC/VPWG
                        mechanism or a specially constituted Under Secretaries Committee reporting
                        to the President through the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> and the
                        Domestic Council. Instead of establishing another bureaucratic layer, the
                        Department favors the option of an Under Secretaries Committee as the most
                        flexible and coherent means of effectively representing the interests of the
                        domestic and foreign policy agencies. Whatever the institutional
                        arrangement, the Department of course welcomes the review group’s support of
                        its lead responsibility (in coordination with other relevant agencies) in
                        the diplomatic and foreign policy elements of <gloss target="#t_US_1"

                    <p>I wish to take this opportunity not only to transmit my Department’s response
                        to the nuclear policy report, but also to offer my personal recommendations
                        on the international aspects of your policy choices, their public
                        presentation, and their diplomatic implementation. The State Department has
                        participated actively in the formulation of the foreign policy elements of
                        this study. I strongly concur in the review group’s emphasis on the
                        international basis for your nuclear policy, and I believe it of central
                        importance both that we maintain consistency between their expression and
                        execution and that we ensure broad multilateral support for the positions
                        you take.</p>
                    <p>Attached are the specific State Department positions, which I fully endorse,
                        on the proposals and options prepared by your interagency group. I concur in
                        the report’s recommendations for effective diplomatic consultations and
                        action, in which we played an active role in developing and which we are
                        prepared to undertake as soon as you give your approval. I need hardly
                        emphasize that the more advance notice of proposed policies and statements
                        we give our nuclear partners and allies, the more likely they will be to
                        provide the support so necessary for the success of our non-proliferation
                        policies. Therefore, this memorandum specifically seeks your early
                        authorization for proposed diplomatic approaches, on the basis of which you
                        could refine the international policy elements of your eventual public
                        statement.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Non-Proliferation Objectives</p>
                    <p>In reviewing and developing further our nuclear policies, it is essential for
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to:</p>
                    <p>1. Ensure that our non-proliferation policies are cast in the framework of
                        our overall foreign policy interests and close relationships with nuclear
                        partners and allies.</p>
                    <pb n="654" facs="0688" xml:id="pg_654"/>
                    <p>2. Retain multilateral support for our non-proliferation policies, without
                        which our political relationships will be set back and our non-proliferation
                        efforts will be rendered ineffective.</p>
                    <p>3. Develop a policy which marries the restraints which we require with the
                        incentives we can offer.</p>
                    <p>4. Prevent our non-proliferation efforts from being distorted by
                        international commercial competition.</p>
                    <p>5. Make domestic decisions which will effectively support, rather than
                        undercut, the primary objective of deterring nuclear proliferation.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Meeting Policy Objectives</p>
                    <p>This Administration can justly claim credit for the concerted and productive
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> efforts to develop strengthened and
                        uniform nuclear safeguards and controls, through bilateral discussions with
                        such key suppliers and consumers as France and Iran and multilateral
                        consultations in the London meetings of major nuclear suppliers. The <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has achieved significant non-proliferation
                        results through high-level, confidential diplomacy, consistent with our
                        broad foreign policy interests and relationships. At the same time, we have
                        openly advocated strengthened nuclear safeguards and controls, in public
                        statements and testimony to the Congress. But domestic pressures have
                        substantially increased for fuller public expressions of what we have
                        pursued privately and for visible improvement and strengthening of our
                        policies.</p>
                    <p>It therefore continues to be necessary to make choices as to what balance is
                        to be struck between diplomatic imperatives and public perceptions of a
                        vigorous, coherent nuclear policy. We should make no apologies for past
                        performance, but we should also not hesitate to stake out new territory.</p>
                    <p>The fundamental need to meet the non-proliferation objectives set out above
                        leads, in my view, to the following policy choices and presentational
                        requirements which are consistent with but often carry further the group’s
                        recommendations:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">New conditions of nuclear supply</hi>, however
                        desirable, <hi rend="italic">should not be imposed by the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> unilaterally</hi>, but rather pursued
                        and adopted multilaterally. I must stress that a unilateral approach will
                        damage us politically, with our allies and partners, and will lead the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to lose both commercially and in
                        non-proliferation terms, as other less committed nations preempt the nuclear
                        market. It should be recognized that if the suppliers, many of whom are also
                        our allies, do not wish to follow a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        initiative voluntarily, then we will either have to coerce them or
                        jeopardize our non-proliferation policy. Clearly, we should not select a
                        strategy which could so easily trap us in such a dilemma. At the same time,
                        we should continue to make best diplomatic efforts to make non-proliferation
                        gains, as I believe we have in our proposed <pb n="655" facs="0689"
                            xml:id="pg_655"/>nuclear agreements with Egypt and Israel and in our
                        current negotiations with Iran. I believe that <hi rend="italic">a strong
                            public statement</hi> could be built around the crucial importance of
                        multilateral consensus in nuclear safeguards and controls, the need for this
                        country not to isolate itself and lose its non-proliferation influence, and
                        your determination to pursue a responsible nuclear export policy while
                        obtaining strong <hi rend="italic">international</hi> support for our
                        non-proliferation efforts.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">It is essential to offer non-proliferation
                            inducements</hi> in the areas of fuel buy-back and exchange, working in
                        concert with other suppliers. Nuclear consumers, particularly those of
                        proliferation concern who already enjoy less constrained agreements, will
                        not voluntarily accept new restraints unless it is demonstrably in their
                        interest to do so. I therefore strongly endorse the review group’s
                        recommendations for assured and equitable front-end fuel services in
                        exchange for spent fuel, which is at the heart of our current negotiating
                        approach with Iran.</p>
                    <p>3. Nuclear consumers will become less disposed to relying on the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> if we arbitrarily impose more stringent
                        conditions on nuclear agreements after their terms have been mutually
                        agreed. <hi rend="italic">We must therefore ensure that the <gloss
                                target="#t_NRC_1">NRC</gloss> licensing procedures are responsive to
                            national policy</hi> as executed by the President, within legislative
                        requirements. Nuclear export licenses should not be used as a lever for
                        obtaining new constraints from countries which live up to their obligations
                        to us. <gloss target="#t_NRC_1">NRC</gloss> procedures should be perceived
                        instead as a means of predictably implementing our policies of providing
                        inducements, such as guaranteed reactor fuel supply, for countries accepting
                        effective non-proliferation constraints.</p>
                    <p>4. We should move to engage other major nuclear suppliers in intensified and
                        multilateral efforts to ensure that uranium enrichment and reprocessing
                        facilities are located in supplier nations. To achieve this, it is necessary
                        to <hi rend="italic">prevent commercial competition from leading to
                            proliferation of such sensitive nuclear facilities</hi>. While I support
                        the review group’s important recommendations for joint supplier fuel-service
                        support for reactor sales, I recommend that you set a long-term framework
                        for effective supplier coordination of fuel assurances, by calling for an
                        examination by interested nations of an “international nuclear fuel bank”
                        concept, as described in the second section of my Department’s position
                        paper, which would combine fuel storage and supply arrangements under
                        international guarantees. With your approval, I will ask my deputies to work
                        with <persName corresp="#p_FRW_1">Bob Fri</persName> in integrating this new
                        element into your nuclear policy statement.</p>
                    <p>5. In this essential multilateral context, I conclude that a <hi
                            rend="italic">limited domestic reprocessing decision</hi> would serve
                        our non-proliferation and foreign policy objectives. In so doing, however,
                        it would be desirable to provide for appropriate foreign participation and
                        essential to identify <pb n="656" facs="0690" xml:id="pg_656"/>the proposed
                        program as an “experiment,” without prejudging its outcome. I can support
                        the demonstration project associated with the “assist reprocessing option”
                        presented by the review group, subject to what I believe are necessary
                        presentational and policy precautions elaborated in the attached position
                        paper, designed to reinforce our overriding non-proliferation interests.</p>
                    <p>6. I agree that you should seize the opportunity to press for rapid
                        Congressional approval of the Nuclear Fuel Assurances Act, as a crucial
                        means for <hi rend="italic">expanding <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            enriched uranium capacity needed to provide credible non-proliferation
                            inducements</hi>. In addition to providing greater <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> enriched uranium capacity to meet foreign
                        needs in the near-term, we should redouble our efforts to develop more
                        efficient and controllable forms of enrichment technology which could very
                        substantially reduce the cost of enriched uranium and expand available
                        supplies. This would permit us to shape an international system which could
                        offer a combination of the “carrot and stick” required to bring about a
                        regime which might dramatically slow the spread of national reprocessing in
                        non-supplier states.</p>
                    <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Nuclear policy message and management</hi>. Your review
                        group has suggested the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> as a possible
                        forum for your nuclear policy statement. <hi rend="italic">I believe that
                            the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> would be an inappropriate
                            forum</hi> for you to discuss our new non-proliferation policies which
                        will inevitably convey a tougher approach toward constraints. Even if
                        tempered by offers of inducements, such a message would likely be viewed by
                        the majority of your audience as restrictive, discriminatory, and targetted
                        against the countries they represent. Nevertheless, if you choose to address
                        the General Assembly on this subject, I would urge that you focus on the
                        cooperative elements of these policies, such as the recommended
                        international spent fuel and plutonium regime and our interest in exploring
                        an international nuclear fuel bank concept. I believe that, in any event,
                        you should reserve for a receptive <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        audience (or in a message to the Congress) the stronger aspects of our
                        policies, as well as any decision to proceed with domestic reprocessing. As
                        a subsidiary consideration, I am not convinced that a new bureaucratic
                        layer—the proposed Nuclear Policy Council—will enhance management
                        effectiveness. You might consider using instead existing interagency
                        committees, such as the specially constituted Under Secretaries Committee
                        described in the attachment, to coordinate <gloss target="#t_US_1"

                        statements. I believe that your statement will afford a significant

                    <p>The Nuclear Policy Review Group that you created on July 14 has completed its
                        assignment and submitted a report (Appendix I) which has been reviewed by
                        agencies (their detailed comments at Appendix II) and your senior
                        advisers.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Problems Requiring Attention</p>
                    <p>Briefly, the following major problems require attention:</p>
                    <p>• There is a growing threat of nuclear proliferation abroad because of the
                        spread of the capability to recover plutonium from “spent” fuel elements
                        from nuclear power and research reactors in a step called “reprocessing.”
                        The separated plutonium is intended to be recycled as reactor fuel. However,
                        the plutonium can also be stolen or clandestinely diverted and used quite
                        quickly to make explosives.</p>
                    <p>• The system of controls to prevent such uses is not adequate for dealing
                        with the growing threat. This system includes <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1"
                            >IAEA</gloss> safeguards and inspections, physical security programs,
                        and various bilateral and multilateral agreements.</p>
                    <p>• Concern in the public and Congress about proliferation abroad is leading
                        toward legislation designed to force our foreign customers to agree to
                        forego reprocessing and the accumulation of plutonium stockpiles—as a
                        condition for receiving nuclear fuel and equipment from <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> suppliers.</p>
                    <pb n="659" facs="0693" xml:id="pg_659"/>
                    <p>• <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> leverage for insisting upon rigorous
                        controls is declining along with our role as the dominant supplier of
                        nuclear fuel and equipment.</p>
                    <p>• Efforts by industry to proceed with commercial scale reprocessing in the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> are stalled because of
                        uncertainties concerning economics, safeguards and regulatory requirements.
                        Also, domestic reprocessing is strongly opposed by some who believe that
                        energy and economic benefits are outweighed by the problems resulting from
                        significant quantities of separated and recycled plutonium. (It should be
                        noted that reprocessing is useful but not crucial to the pursuit of the
                        nuclear power option, at least for the next 10 to 20 years.)</p>
                    <p>• Uncertainties about reprocessing and long-term nuclear waste management (a
                        Federal responsibility) are being used by opponents of expansion of nuclear
                        power in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> (Six more states will have
                        anti-nuclear initiatives on their November ballots.)</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommended Response</p>
                    <p>There is general agreement among heads of agencies concerned and your senior
                        advisers on a recommendation that you issue a major statement on nuclear
                        policy which:</p>
                    <p>• Reaffirms <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> intent to increase the use
                        of nuclear power.</p>
                    <p>• Recognizes that other countries will do the same regardless of <gloss

                    <p>• Reflects <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> intent to be a reliable and
                        competitive international supplier of nuclear fuel and equipment.</p>
                    <p>• Reflects great concern about the spread of reprocessing abroad because of
                        the potential for theft by terrorists or diversion by nations of separated
                        plutonium.</p>
                    <p>• Announces policy changes to deal with this concern, backed up by a series
                        of specific proposals to tighten controls, offer incentives to those who
                        cooperate in restricting reprocessing, and impose sanctions on those who
                        violate agreements.</p>
                    <p>• Announces Administration position on reprocessing in the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and a course of action to carry out that
                        position.</p>
                    <p>• Commits the Administration to assure the availability of a nuclear waste
                        disposal facility when needed about in 1985.</p>
                    <p>However, with respect to reprocessing here and abroad, there is disagreement
                        among your advisers on:</p>
                    <p>• Whether and when reprocessing should be used.</p>
                    <p>• The desirability and effectiveness of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        attempts to get other nations to forego reprocessing.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Issues Requiring Your Attention</p>
                    <p>If you agree that a Presidential response is warranted to deal with
                        outstanding nuclear policy problems, your decision is needed on the <pb

                        (discussed below).</p>
                    <p>In addition, your decision will be needed later on specific initiatives in
                        support of the general policy decision that you make. Those specific
                        initiatives will be developed in greater detail and presented for your
                        approval while the statement is being developed.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Principal Issue—Policy on Acceptability of
                        Reprocessing Here and Abroad and the Control of Separated Plutonium</p>
                    <p>All of your advisers agree that some change of current policies (summarized
                        in Alt. #1, below) on reprocessing and the control of separated plutonium
                        are needed. They disagree as to the nature of the change—largely because of
                        different views on:</p>
                    <p>• The relative weight given to non-proliferation and other foreign policy
                        considerations, and on energy and economic objectives.</p>
                    <p>• The chances of changing significantly the course of worldwide events
                        leading to reprocessing, a step which creates the capability for
                        proliferation.</p>
                    <p>• The probable effectiveness of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> attempts
                        to use its diminishing supplier role to deter other nations from proceeding
                        with reprocessing.</p>
                    <p>• The impact, here and abroad, of a change in <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> policy which now assumes that we will proceed with
                        reprocessing and recycle of plutonium.</p>
                    <p>Four principal positions on domestic and foreign reprocessing and
                        alternatives are identified and described below. The principal variables
                        among the four alternatives are:</p>
                    <p>• The toughness of our stand against the spread of reprocessing abroad.</p>
                    <p>• Our attitude toward reprocessing in the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> and the government role in bringing about
                        reprocessing.</p>
                    <p>• The extent of the consistency between our domestic and foreign policy on
                        reprocessing.</p>
                    <p>• The importance attached to the breeder reactor—which is dependent upon
                        reprocessing and plutonium recycle (though a decision on breeder
                        commercialization is not scheduled by <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss>
                        until 1986).</p>
                    <p>• <hi rend="italic">Alt. #1</hi>. Continue to resist the spread of
                        reprocessing abroad but with no significant change in policy or significant
                        new initiatives. Continue current policy on domestic reprocessing, which
                        assumes reprocessing, and recycle of plutonium, encourages the development
                        of a private reprocessing industry, and provides limited government
                        assistance on reprocessing <gloss target="#t_RD_1">R&amp;D</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Your statement announcing this position would stress concern about the spread
                        of international reprocessing, stress the need to work <pb n="661"
                            facs="0695" xml:id="pg_661"/>cooperatively with other nations, take
                        credit for past <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> actions and limited
                        efforts now underway or planned.</p>
                    <p>In effect, we would be accepting the inevitability of the spread of
                        reprocessing and not make a major effort to halt that spread.</p>
                    <p>• Principal arguments for this approach are that:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>—Other nations who view us as overreacting to the risk of proliferation
                            would be reassured of our steadiness.</p>
                        <p>—There would be little additional Federal involvement in reprocessing
                            now.</p>

                    <p>• Principal arguments against this approach are that:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>—It does not deal with the currently perceived threat of proliferation
                            and would be unacceptable to the Congress and the public.</p>
                        <p>—Differences in <gloss target="#t_NRC_1">NRC</gloss> and Executive Branch
                            attitude would be obvious since <gloss target="#t_NRC_1">NRC</gloss>
                            almost certainly will deny some exports that our trading partners expect
                            under existing agreements for cooperation.</p>
                        <p>—Uncertainties about domestic reprocessing would continue.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>• <hi rend="italic">Alt. #2</hi>. Significantly strengthen efforts to limit
                        the spread of reprocessing abroad (but accept its inevitability) and to
                        prevent theft and diversion of separated plutonium—hopefully in cooperation
                        with other nations, but with unilateral moves when necessary. Continue
                        current policy of encouraging development of a domestic reprocessing
                        industry, with a commitment to assist with a Federal commercial scale
                        demonstration.</p>
                    <p>Your statement announcing this policy would stress concern about the spread
                        of international reprocessing, highlight the need for major new steps to
                        avoid this spread and to strengthen safeguards, tighten our export
                        restrictions, and offer incentives to customers and suppliers to cooperate.
                        It will also include a greater Federal role in demonstrating commercial
                        scale reprocessing in this country and justify domestic reprocessing plans
                        on the grounds that capacity is needed to understand economics and
                        safeguards and to provide reprocessing services for both <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and foreign needs.</p>
                    <p>In effect, you would be accepting this inevitability of reprocessing but
                        would be moving vigorously to limit its spread in other countries. Many
                        nations probably would go along with this position but (a) Brazil and
                        Pakistan would proceed with plans for major reprocessing plants, and (b)
                        Germany and France would continue a more liberal policy toward assisting
                        others to build reprocessing facilities. Reactor manufacturers in the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would be concerned about impact on foreign
                        sales but they, and others, in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        nuclear industry would welcome the commitment to reprocessing and the plan
                        to resolve uncertainties.</p>
                    <p>• Principal arguments for this approach are:</p>

                        <p>—Offers the basis for a reasonable compromise with other suppliers:
                            Canada favors tougher stand against reprocessing; the <gloss

                    </quote>
                    <p>• Principal arguments against this approach are:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>—It does not go far enough to meet the expectations of some critics in

                            outweigh energy and economic advantages.</p>
                        <p>—Leaves some inconsistency between our negative attitude towards

                        <p>—Further commits the Administration to reprocessing and recycle while

                            still pending.</p>
                        <p>—Calls for significant increase in government role in reprocessing and
                            also involves government costs for a domestic reprocessing demonstration
                            (upwards of $1 billion through 1985) and buy back of foreign fuel
                            (upwards of $200 million through 1985 and $3 billion through 2000).</p>
                        <p>—In effect, it would commit the government to assist in starting up a
                            $270 million existing privately owned spent fuel separations facility at
                            Barnwell, South Carolina, with the potential charge of “bailing out” a

                        <p>—Adds uncertainty to the viability of the breeder, but a decision on
                            breeder commercialization will not be made until 1986.</p>
                        <p>—Highlighting of alternative technologies (which have not yet been
                            developed) can raise false expectations that reprocessing is not
                            necessary and thus lend credence to opponents’ arguments against
                            proceeding even with a reprocessing demonstration.</p>
                        <p>—General public may view it as a signal that the government is less sure
                            about safety of nuclear energy.</p>

                        here and abroad. Commit the government to a major program to explore and
                        evaluate the feasibility of alternative technologies for getting energy
                        value from spent fuel without separating the plutonium. If unsuccessful,
                        prepare to dispose of spent fuel without regard to the energy value or
                        possibly reactivate reprocessing at some later date.</p>
                    <p>Your statement would make clear that we view reprocessing as a serious
                        danger, that we are foreswearing reprocessing and urge others to do so as

                        <p>—Could improve our ability to persuade sensitive countries such as Korea,

                            facilities by our removing the argument that we were seeking to deprive

                        ever since negotiations began last year. Israel accepts the package concept

                        would be subject to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> approval and, if
                        permitted, such plutonium transfer would be in the form of fabricated fuel
                        elements.</p>
                    <p>h. The enrichment of uranium fuel to be transferred under the agreements is
                        restricted to below 20% in the isotope U–235.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Congressional Outlook</p>
                    <p>It will not be possible to complete the required 60-day congressional review
                        period during this session unless Congress reconvenes after the election or
                        unless it decides to act quickly and not take the full 60 days. Neither of
                        these is probable. In addition, the Senate has just authorized a group of
                        six Senators (headed by <persName corresp="#p_RAA_1">Ribicoff</persName> and
                        including Baker) to visit the Middle East in November and to report on the
                        impact of <pb n="667" facs="0701" xml:id="pg_667"/>introducing nuclear
                        technology there. The Senate would probably defer action on the Egyptian and
                        Israeli agreements until it receives the report of this group in the next
                        session.</p>
                    <p>The reaction on the <persName corresp="#p_HRC_1">Hill</persName> to the
                        substance must also be considered. The agreements contain unprecedented
                        restrictions and controls and present no real proliferation risks. A
                        complicating factor, however, is the introduction by Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_PJO_1">Pastore</persName> of his non-proliferation bill,
                        which, as you know, is now the subject of negotiation between the Senator,
                        Senator <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName>, Congressman <persName
                            corresp="#p_AJ_1">John Anderson</persName> and the Administration. The
                        draft legislation contains a requirement for the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> to initiate immediate negotiations with other supplier
                        nations seeking agreement that, as a condition to exports to other
                        countries, all nuclear material in the possession of the recipient country
                        must be under international safeguards and that <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1"
                            >IAEA</gloss> safeguards must be applied to all nuclear activities in
                        these countries. In our discussions with <persName corresp="#p_PJO_1"
                            >Pastore</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1">Anderson</persName> and
                        others, we have not indicated that this is an unacceptable position, and
                        they undoubtedly believe that the Administration is prepared to support this
                        section of the bill. This provision, of course, is only a call for best
                        effort negotiation and does not require the unilateral imposition of these
                        conditions failing agreement with the other suppliers. However, it does put
                        us on record as a strong supporter of international safeguards for all
                        nuclear activities in recipient countries. (In the <persName
                            corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName> version of the bill, these
                        conditions would have to be imposed unilaterally after 18 months.) Neither
                        the draft Egyptian or Israeli agreements conform to these particular
                        criteria, because Israel would not accept the idea of placing all of its
                        nuclear material under international safeguards. The agreements may be
                        opposed on the grounds that they are out of step with congressional
                        thinking, although the special position of Israel should soften the
                        criticism.</p>
                    <p>These agreements could impact negatively on the non-proliferation initiatives
                        which are contained in the <persName corresp="#p_FRW_1">Fri</persName>
                        study. One of the proposals of that study, concurred in by all agencies, is
                        that criteria for considering new nuclear agreements would include whether
                        the proposed recipient was a party to the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                            >NPT</gloss> or prepared to submit <hi rend="italic">all</hi> its
                        nuclear facilities to safeguards, and whether it was prepared to forego or
                        postpone indefinitely the establishment of national reprocessing. Departure
                        from these criteria would require your personal approval. The Egyptian and
                        Israeli agreements would not meet those criteria.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, Congress may perceive inconsistencies in your position if the
                        first agreements you submit to Congress, essentially coinciding with your
                        non-proliferation message, do not meet these enunciated criteria. (The
                        counter argument, however, is that other countries will supply nuclear
                        material to Egypt under less stringent conditions if we do not. Our
                        non-proliferation interest is best achieved by coupling <pb n="668"
                            facs="0702" xml:id="pg_668"/>supply with strict safeguards. Israel’s
                        special relationship with the United States and recognition that Egypt has
                        not adhered to the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> because Israel
                        refuses to do so are other mitigating factors.)</p>
                    <p>These agreements could become a political issue. However, the fact that
                        Israel wants this agreement should help to minimize the difficulties. For
                        example, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>’s first
                        offer of nuclear cooperation to Egypt encountered strong opposition in 1974.
                        By contrast, when you announced the principles that would be embodied in the
                        agreement during President <persName corresp="#p_SAA_1">Sadat</persName>’s
                        visit earlier this year, there was no adverse reaction. These different
                        congressional and press reactions probably resulted at least in part from a
                        shift in Israel’s position on this issue. In 1974 Israel was not interested
                        in a nuclear agreement with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                    </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Agency Views</p>
                    <p>State recommends that the agreement be submitted to Congress now. We
                        essentially committed ourselves to do this in reaching final agreement with
                        Egypt and Israel, and failure to forward the agreements to Congress at this
                        time would have a sharply negative impact. We pushed the two countries to
                        complete the negotiations quickly on the grounds that the required
                        congressional approval would be progressively more difficult to obtain as
                        the congressional session drew to a close. Even if, as seems probable,
                        Congress decides to take no action, our commitments in Cairo and Tel Aviv
                        will have been satisfied and no domestic political fracas will have
                        occurred.</p>

                        <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss> recommends that submission of the
                        agreements be made only after congressional action on the non-proliferation
                        bill and after presentation of your non-proliferation message which will
                        enunciate your broad policy objectives. If we do otherwise, <gloss
                            target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss> believes we may have difficulty in
                        defeating unacceptable and unrealistic amendments to the non-proliferation
                        bill. As you know, Senators <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName>
                        and <persName corresp="#p_GJ_1">Glenn</persName> consider the Joint
                        Committee’s and the Administration’s approaches to non-proliferation too
                        weak. <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_GJ_1">Glenn</persName> might try to use the Egyptian and
                        Israeli agreements to make the point that the Administration cannot be
                        trusted to be tough enough, and that legislative mandates are needed. We
                        would hope to be able to convince most people that the agreements present no
                        real proliferation risks and that they contain unprecedented restrictions
                        and controls that would not be imposed by the other suppliers who are
                        prepared to provide nuclear technology, at least to Egypt. These agreements,
                        therefore, can justifiably be presented as a big step toward the achievement
                        of tighter non-proliferation controls.</p>

                        submit the agreements during this session, or if you do decide to do so,
                        that the submission follow final action on the proliferation bill and

                        <persName corresp="#p_CJM_1">Jim Cannon</persName> thinks it could be
                        damaging to you, and to the agreements, to send them up to Congress at the
                        last minute. He recommends against submission in this session.</p>
                    <p>There is no doubt about the awkwardness of submitting these agreements in
                        close proximity to the promulgation of broad proliferation policy
                        objectives, to which they constitute exceptions. That is true whether they
                        come before or after your policy declaration. The hazards of submitting the
                        agreements ahead of the policy are set forth above. If they are submitted
                        following your policy declaration, however, we run the risk of at least
                        severe criticism that we have laid out a new policy and the first agreements
                        submitted under that policy are incompatible with it. On balance, I think
                        the principal problem is in connection with the pending proliferation
                        legislation. I do not believe the relationship to your proliferation policy
                        statement is crucial. I recommend, therefore, submission of the agreements
                        in this session immediately following disposition of the pending
                        legislation, either by action on the bill or by setting it aside.</p>

                    <p>2. Nuclear Disarmament. Memorandum states first step is to stop manufacturing
                        nuclear weapons, equipping armed forces with them, and developing new types
                        of such weapons. This should be accompanied or immediately followed by
                        reductions in stocks, with transfer of nuclear materials to peaceful
                        purposes. Reduction of weapons stocks should be accompanied by reduction of
                        means of delivery. Simultaneously, measures should also be taken for
                        limitation and reduction of armed forces and conventional weapons. This
                        process is “inconceivable” unless all nuclear-weapon states (<gloss
                            target="#t_NWS_1">NWS</gloss>) take part. <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss> is prepared to engage together with all other <gloss
                            target="#t_NWS_1">NWS</gloss> in “comprehensive discussion of nuclear
                        disarmament problem in all its scope and elaboration of concrete ways of its
                        practical solution.” <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> “has no
                        objections” to non-nuclear-weapon states (<gloss target="#t_NWS_1"
                            >NWS</gloss>) also participating.</p>
                    <p>3. <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>. Memorandum asserts that conditions
                        are ripe for achievement of a <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>,
                        “particularly as a result of signing” of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss>-Soviet <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> treaty, which
                        establishes procedure for <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNEs</gloss> that “will
                        preclude their use for perfecting nuclear weapons.” Recalling 1975 Soviet
                            <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> resolution, memorandum says it is
                        “necessary to begin negotiations promptly.” It rejects argument that
                        teleseismic means are insufficient to verify compliance with a <gloss
                            target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> but does not reject on-site inspection:
                        “the Soviet Union is convinced that no particular difficulties should arise
                        in elaborating such a compromise basis for an agreement as would ensure a
                        voluntary framework for taking decisions relating to on-site ascertaining of
                        relevant circumstances and, at the same time, impart confidence to all
                        parties to the treaty that the obligations are complied with.”</p>
                    <p>4. Nonproliferation. Memorandum states it is “important to strive for the
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> to become truly universal” (no
                        holdouts are mentioned by name). It also asserts that other types of action
                        are necessary. Noting that international commercial exchange of nuclear
                        materials, equipment, and technology will lead to increased production of
                        plutonium that can be used for nuclear weapons, memorandum states that
                        nuclear suppliers bear special responsibility and that strict safeguards are
                        needed to prevent nuclear cooperation from becoming channel for spread of
                        nuclear weapons. It also states that Soviet Union “resolutely advocates the
                        need for perfecting in every possible way the system of control over nuclear
                        installations and materials exercised by the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1"
                            >IAEA</gloss>” and is ready to cooperate toward this end with all
                        interested states.</p>
                    <p>5. <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>. Reaffirming Soviet preference for a
                        single-step comprehensive ban on all chemical weapons, memorandum at same
                        time recon<pb n="672" facs="0706" xml:id="pg_672"/>firms Soviet willingness
                        to start with an agreement on prohibition and elimination of the most
                        dangerous, lethal types of chemical weapons, adding that a “substantial
                        contribution to this end could be the implementation” of the 1974 <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet agreement to consider a joint
                        initiative in the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss>. On verification,
                        memorandum states that control should be exercised, as in <gloss
                            target="#t_BW_1">BW</gloss> Convention, by “national means.” However, it
                        goes on to assert that “the Soviet Union is ready to examine a possibility
                        of using additional control procedures and, in particular, to discuss
                        methods of verifying the destruction of stocks of chemical weapons.”</p>
                    <p>6. <gloss target="#t_MDW_1">MDW</gloss>. Memorandum says negotiations on new
                            <gloss target="#t_MDW_1">MDW</gloss> should be given “top priority.” It
                        proposes, as an approach to definition, that new <gloss target="#t_MDW_1"
                            >MDW</gloss> include “any types of weapons based on qualitatively new
                        principles of action—according to the method of use and the targets to be
                        attacked or the nature of their impact.” Examples cited are “ray weapons
                        capable of affecting blood and intracellular plasma, infrasound weapons
                        designed to damage internal organs and affect human behavior, and genetic
                        weapons the use of which would affect the mechanism of heredity.” New
                        “systems” of <gloss target="#t_MDW_1">MDW</gloss> include not only systems
                        for new types of <gloss target="#t_MDW_1">MDW</gloss> but also systems
                        “introducing new technical elements of combat or support means” that can
                        increase dangerous characteristics of weapons based on existing principles:
                        “aero-space systems of nuclear weapons on the basis of transport space ships
                        may serve as an example.”</p>
                    <p>7. Reduction of Armed Forces and Conventional Armaments. Noting increasing
                        destructiveness of conventional weapons, memorandum asserts need for
                        “feasible measures to reduce aircraft, artillery, tanks, and other modern
                        types of conventional weapons as well as armed forces equipped with these
                        weapons.” It recalls Soviet proposals for ceilings on armed forces of major
                        states and says that “even now the Soviet Union is prepared to conduct
                        negotiations on reduction of armed forces and armaments.” In addition, memo
                        states desirability of “new efforts at the international level to bring
                        about the elimination of all military bases in foreign territories and the
                        withdrawal of foreign troops from such territories.”</p>
                    <p>8. <gloss target="#t_IOPZ_1">IOPZ</gloss>. In notable shift of Soviet
                        position, memorandum expresses “understanding” for <gloss target="#t_IOPZ_1"
                            >IOPZ</gloss> idea and asserts that “the Soviet Union would be prepared
                        together with other powers to seek ways for reducing on a reciprocal basis
                        military activities of non-littoral states in the Indian Ocean and in the
                        regions directly adjacent to it.” It notes that such measures “must fully
                        take into account” international law on freedom of navigation on the high
                        seas and need for “associated business calls” at ports as well as for
                        research. Paper asserts that “key question” is to ensure absence of foreign
                        military bases in region and <pb n="673" facs="0707" xml:id="pg_673"
                        />dismantling of existing ones. “As to the Soviet Union, it did not and does
                        not intend to build military bases in the Indian Ocean.” Memorandum further
                        notes that <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is “prepared to consider
                        the question of its attitude” toward the convening of a conference on the
                        Indian Ocean. <hi rend="italic">Comment.</hi>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>’s statement was more
                        explicit in stating that Soviets were prepared to participate in
                        preparations for such a conference provided their concerns were met. <hi

                    <p>9. Mediterranean. Memo recalls earlier Soviet proposal to <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> that <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> withdraw from the Mediterranean
                        their ships and submarines carrying nuclear weapons and states that this
                        proposal is “still valid.”</p>
                    <p>10. Memo briefly expresses support for nuclear-weapon-free zone proposals and
                        asserts that <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is in favor of “stopping
                        the arms race in the Middle East within the framework of a comprehensive
                        political settlement of the Middle East conflict.”</p>
                    <p>11. <gloss target="#t_ROB_1">ROB</gloss>. Ignoring the experts’ study under
                        the <gloss target="#t_SYG_1">SYG</gloss>’s auspices of technical issues
                        involved in the measurement and comparison of military expenditures, memo
                        refers to 1973 Soviet proposal for ten percent reduction of military budgets
                        of permanent members of the Security Council and says Soviets are flexible
                        on percentage reduction to be agreed upon. It proposes that agreement on a
                        figure “greater or smaller than 10 percent” be reached as a first step
                        during 1977, adding that the question should be made as soon as possible a
                        subject of “businesslike negotiations between the states concerned.”</p>
                    <p>12. <gloss target="#t_WDC_1">WDC</gloss> and Special Session on Disarmament.
                        Memo once again endorses convening of a world disarmament conference as a
                        forum for achievement of “cardinal changes in the solution of the
                        disarmament problem.” It adds, however, that a special session of the <gloss
                            target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> could become an appropriate forum for
                        discussing disarmament questions, determining ways of solving them, and
                        working out a long-term program of practical steps. A special session would
                        be “an interim stage which should by its decisions prepare a broad and
                        radical review of the disarmament problem at the world (disarmament)
                        conference.” Cryptic concluding comment states that special session “should
                        not be restrained by strict time limits or the procedure followed at the
                        General Assembly sessions, including special sessions.”</p>

                            Krasulin</persName>, singled out <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>,
                            <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>, and Indian Ocean as the most
                        important items in <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>’s <gloss
                            target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> proposals and placed great importance on
                        the willingness of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> to accept
                        on-site inspection for <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>. On Indian Ocean he underlined the
                        importance of the questions of foreign bases and military transit in the
                        Soviet position. <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> Division Multilateral
                        Affairs Counselor backed him up on verification and Indian Ocean in separate
                        conversation. <hi rend="italic">End summary.</hi>

                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Krasulin</persName>, in an expansive mood,
                        gave a detailed analysis of <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2"
                        >Gromyko</persName>’s <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> speech and
                        related documents. He focused his attention on the memorandum to <gloss
                            target="#t_UNSYG_1">UNSYG</gloss>, calling it a most important document
                        for Soviet foreign policy and one to which they expected to refer constantly
                        in the future. He stressed that much careful preparation went into its
                        formulation and throughout the conversation showed evident pride in the role
                        that he and others in <gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss> had played in
                        producing it. He indicated several times that there were difficulties in
                        getting the document through the bureaucracy and that the new elements in it
                        faced substantial opposition. The thrust of his remarks was that other
                        countries should be pleased that the proposals have seen the light of day.
                        In separate conversation at same function <gloss target="#t_MFA_1"
                            >MFA</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> Division Counselor (for multilateral
                        affairs) <persName corresp="#p_SOM_1">Sokolov</persName> made same point to
                        Acting Pol Counselor re positions on verification and Indian Ocean, adding
                        that resistance to the Indian Ocean proposal was particularly strong.</p>
                    <p>3. <gloss target="#t_EmbOff_1">EmbOff</gloss> suggested to <persName
                            corresp="#p_KB_1">Krasulin</persName> that “platter” <persName
                            corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName> placed before <gloss
                            target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> was so extensive that there must be some
                        priorities placed <pb n="675" facs="0709" xml:id="pg_675"/>on the topics by
                        Soviets. <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Krasulin</persName> responded
                        affirmatively saying that the most important parts of the memorandum were
                        sections on <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss> and Indian Ocean.</p>
                    <p>4. On <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>, which he placed at top of list,
                        he said that acceptance in principle of on-site inspection was major step by
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. He referred to this as an
                        extension of inspection agreed to for <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        agreement (which he characterized as “revolutionary step for us”). However,
                        in explaining concept further he said that Soviets were suggesting something
                        like “Swedish formula” in which the “country suspected” of violation of
                        agreement would invite “suspecting countries” to conduct on-site inspection
                        to assure themselves. When asked if such a voluntary approach could
                        reasonably be expected to work, <persName corresp="#p_KB_1"
                            >Krasulin</persName> replied that it could work and that Soviet proposal
                        could serve as the basis for negotiations on the issue. This question,
                        however, as well as the specific modalities could, he said, be discussed in
                        negotiations.</p>
                    <p>5. On <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Krasulin</persName> also stressed the importance
                        of <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName>’s remarks concerning
                        “control” which he said represented a substantial step forward. Here too the
                        Soviets were willing to accept in principle on-site inspection with respect
                        to destruction of chemical weapon stocks. He said that <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> concern over verification had prompted
                        Soviets to take this “extra step” and that now “the ball is in your court.”
                        He commented very favorably on the utility of the recent experts’
                        consultation in Geneva and looked forward to a new round of such talks
                        soon.</p>
                    <p>6. On the Indian Ocean <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Krasulin</persName> noted
                        that this was the first time the Soviet Union had shown a willingness to
                        attend a conference on the Indian Ocean provided “minor conditions” are met.
                            <gloss target="#t_EmbOff_1">EmbOff</gloss> noted that question of
                        foreign bases was given great importance by <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2"
                            >Gromyko</persName>. Italian <gloss target="#t_PolCouns_1"
                            >PolCouns</gloss> (who joined conversation at this point) asked if
                            <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Krasulin</persName> might clarify the
                        relationship of this issue to the overall question of a conference; was the
                        solution of the issue of bases a precondition for the conference? <persName
                            corresp="#p_KB_1">Krasulin</persName> said he would not use the word
                        “precondition” but, he continued, it was evidently an issue of primary
                        importance. Asked if there was any significance to the use of the word
                        “activity” in describing what would be mutually reduced (as opposed to
                        “presence”), <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Krasulin</persName> said he did not
                        think so, and went on to say that Soviet presence in the Indian Ocean was
                        necessary for transit from the Soviet Far East to Europe. Any attempt to
                        reduce military activity would have, he said, to take account of “Soviet
                        needs” for free transit. He recognized the “need” that “others” might have
                        for “presence” in the Indian Ocean but implied that he did not consider such
                        needs on the same order as those of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: Good morning.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Hi.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: The newspapers all
                        report that there’s going to be a statement out of the White House today on
                        nuclear policy.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: And we’ve sent you an
                        outline, a preliminary draft—</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: —that is still being
                        worked on. But there are three questions. No. 1 is the basic form of the
                        State—</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But what’s the
                        sense of showing me the draft 24 hours before it’s being delivered?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: Well, we still have
                        some flexibility.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, not if
                        it’s going to be issued today.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: Well, our draft was
                        sent to you on Friday.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No, no. On
                        Friday, when it was supposed to be delivered Saturday? That still only gave
                        me 24 hours. It wasn’t until Saturday afternoon that they were doing it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: We sent it as soon as we
                        had a draft, and it was a summary of what we had sent you a week—</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I have no
                        objection to it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: No variation in
                        substance from anything else.</p>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I didn’t
                        understand it—which may have helped me. (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>I don’t understand. What is the point? Can you sum up three main points of
                        that document?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: It really gets back to the
                        three themes we’ve been talking about for a month or two—the strengthening
                        of safeguards, the control of plutonium, the getting out of exports—</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But my
                        15-year-old can do that. What are we proposing specifically?</p>
                    <p>That’s the one part I understood. What also?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: The storage of plutonium
                        under international auspices.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It will never be
                        agreed to.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: What?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It will never be
                        agreed to.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName>: No. That might, as a
                        matter of fact, because we volunteered to do it.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: In individual
                        countries but not in the United States.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: Ultimately it’s going
                        to come back to control of the plutonium cycle in the supplier nations; and
                        they’re going to be Europe, the Soviet Union, the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> And so what we’re talking about is not inconsistent with
                        that. That will have to be negotiated. But our primary concern has been
                        putting this statement in a form that didn’t look like we were trying to
                        apply our principles unilaterally, but we were merely setting the stage for
                        a multilateral discussion. So there are two other elements. No. 1 is advance
                        notice to our allies, which we hope to get out before the statement is
                        released. And No. 2 is the diplomatic follow-up which will be requested with
                        France first, Germany second, then the balance.</p>
                    <p>Well, that’s our proposal to you, but—</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: One other element is the
                        reprocessing is looked upon very tenderly. So that we set a trend, we make
                        sure this makes sense before we go ahead with other countries rather than
                        having to set up their own—</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s what I
                        thought it said. Our reprocessing will be looked at tenderly.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: And to look at other
                        technologies to see whether the process makes any sense.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, it sure as
                        hell makes sense. It’s like prohibition. It certainly makes sense to
                        countries that want nuclear bombs. Pakistan isn’t getting a reprocessing
                        plant because it doesn’t understand that it is not now economical.</p>
                    <pb n="678" facs="0712" xml:id="pg_678"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: What this does—it takes
                        care of the technical and economic dimensions. It doesn’t take care of the
                        political-security dimensions, which is much more fundamental. That gets you
                        into security guarantees; that gets you into regional conflicts being
                        resolved by other means. And if a country wants a bomb that doesn’t get
                        sold, there’s no question about that.</p>
                    <p>What it does do is tie up the technical and economic restraints.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: And what it does is set
                        it out on the table for the world to get a look at it.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: When is it going
                        to be released? Is it going to be released today?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: That’s not for sure.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, how is it
                        going to be released? They’re just going to dump it on the White House Press
                        Corps?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: It’s going to be briefed by
                        State, <persName corresp="#p_SBA_1">Scowcroft</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJM_1">Cannon</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJM_1">Cannon</persName>?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJM_1">Cannon</persName>, yes.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What does he
                        know about it?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: He’s on the Domestic
                        Council.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Who’s briefing
                        for State?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: <persName
                            corresp="#p_VGS_1">George Vest</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">Vest</persName>: And we don’t know that it’s
                        going to happen today, sir, either.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: It’s the detailed facts
                        which make it a lot more palatable than the statement itself.
                        (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. It’s not a
                        masterpiece of comprehensive ability either, I must tell you. I read both of
                        them on Friday. That point, I figured, was coming out Saturday anyway, and
                        it was beyond help. The basic document is incomprehensible.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: It’s less incomprehensible
                        than the one we got, that’s all I can say.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The basic
                        document does not explain exactly what the solutions are, but it has sort of
                        a mishmash of a variety of measures unrelated to a central theme.</p>
                    <p>The summary is better, I grant you. But it’s not a masterpiece of lucidity
                        either. It does not explain exactly what the problem is with which we’re
                        trying to deal and how. Neither of them explains that we’re inviting other
                        nations to join us.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: Well, it doesn’t do it
                        very clearly.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, if it
                        doesn’t do it very clearly, it doesn’t do it.</p>
                    <pb n="679" facs="0713" xml:id="pg_679"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: What it does is set out the
                        initiatives. What it does is address the speech. I agree with you that the
                        statement should be clearer.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, if it’s
                        supposed to be our basic document on proliferation, what’s the difference
                        whether they put it out in a speech or in a statement; and why should a
                        statement be less clear than a speech?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: Well, it’s being aimed
                        at the domestic market for political reasons.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The domestic
                        market is concerned with foreign policy. Why is it easier to explain
                        domestically in a series of ad hoc, unrelated initiatives?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: You have to be tough to
                        solve domestic problems, but you have to be more flexible in the approach to
                        deal with the international.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That never
                        works, and it doesn’t sound so tough; does it?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: We’ve softened it down
                        in order to avoid problems.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I don’t object
                        to it because it’s too tough. I object to it because it’s
                        incomprehensible.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: I agree.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">Vest</persName>: One reason it’s
                        incomprehensible is because they have not made a firm decision on what
                        they’re doing in one area.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Which is
                        what?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">Vest</persName>: Which is what you’re going
                        to do about reprocessing in this country. They’ve made a halfway decision on
                        that. It is not clear how they will carry it through, and it is not clear
                        what kind of international association might be favored in this activity.
                        It’s a—</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: In other words,
                        we’re not going to offer reprocessing here?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: No, no.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We’re not going
                        to go forward?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: We’re going to go
                        forward with a demonstration effort in order to determine whether or not we
                        can solve the technical, the economic and safety problems involved in
                        reprocessing.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Here?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, if the
                        goddam Pakistanis can do it, why can’t we do it?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: It’s to establish the
                        technology and the economics—</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Of the
                        reprocessing?</p>
                    <pb n="680" facs="0714" xml:id="pg_680"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: The Pakistanis are not
                        concerned with the economics. Anyone knows you can make a dirty,
                        inefficient—</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName>: Costly.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: —costly—one to produce
                        weapons.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sonnenfeldt: It’s in South Carolina, from where I have just returned,
                        where the polls are changing. So I think that explains what’s happening.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Where are they
                        changing—to the Democrats?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sonnenfeldt: No, no. The other way.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, that would
                        lead to three reprocessing plants. (Laughter.) Why keep it tentative?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName>: More economic.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: We’re not proud of this
                        effort, but it’s being handled by the White House. What we’re trying to do
                        is minimize the damage in international relations.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, but it
                        doesn’t say something that’s correct. Well, I have—</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: We’re doing the best we
                        can to get that statement in a form—</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Look, you can’t
                        tell me you’re doing the best you can at 8:15, Chuck, on a day in which it’s
                        likely to be delivered. That means it’s out.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: It’s not out yet, and
                        we still have suggested changes.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Like what? I
                        just haven’t been in on this at all.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: These are the basic
                        changes that the group is trying to get into the last draft (showing
                        document to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>),
                        and I’m hopeful we’ll be able to clarify some points that are important.
                        That process is still going on.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: I think what we’re trying
                        to do is get a road map up front so it’s clear, with all the initiatives in
                        place.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Why?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: Why what?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Why is that hard
                        to get across? That’s got nothing to do with policy.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: It was in the fact sheet.
                        The White House didn’t like it that way.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sonnenfeldt: It’s a multipurpose operation which has to be geared to the
                        domestic nuclear power industry as well as the non-proliferation. It becomes
                        rather difficult—</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Only if the
                        theory of government on which we’re operating is that middle-level
                        bureaucrats make treaties with <pb n="681" facs="0715" xml:id="pg_681"/>each
                        other and that I get involved only when the middle level can’t agree—even
                        then, hopefully not, because I’ll hack it away. Nobody can tell me we can’t
                        solve a thing like this at the appropriate level. You may not be able to
                        solve it at the middle level.</p>
                    <p>I don’t see what interest of the White House is served by putting out an
                        incomprehensible paper. Power industry or not, I don’t see what there is
                        with the power industry on the non-proliferation—I don’t see how you’re
                        going to handle an idiotic reprocessing plant in which we’re going to decide
                        it’s economical for us and then we’re going to decide it’s not economical—so
                        that nobody is going to reprocess, according to our plan, and we can’t
                        reprocess here—which is one of the options we offered to the Shah.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWP_1">Lord</persName>: We said it could be
                        multinational or binational, including the suppliers. But we just want to
                        see whether the whole thing makes sense. That’s the plan. It’s not totally

                            corresp="#p_TRM_1">Timerbayev</persName> as much as dismissed the
                        non-use-of force treaty; described <gloss target="#t_MDW_1">MDW</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> passages as “going public” with
                        positions the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is familiar with; alluded
                        to the importance of new passages on conventional arms limitations and the
                        Indian <pb n="682" facs="0716" xml:id="pg_682"/>Ocean; and concentrated on
                            <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> verification. Soviets have no text,
                        but have in mind “Swedish idea” of on-site inspection, voluntarily accepted,
                        to allay doubts of treaty parties who present evidence to establish concern
                        that seismic event may not be natural. There is a problem with maintaining
                            <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> regime and extending it downward,
                        but May 28 agreement is “good basis” for discussion, and Soviet offer
                        intended to facilitate opening of negotiations where all issues can be

                    <p>2. Asked what he considered to be highlights of <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2"
                            >Gromyko</persName>’s <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> memorandum
                        on stopping the arms race, <gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_IO_1">IO</gloss> Deputy <persName corresp="#p_TRM_1"
                            >Timerbayev</persName> basically elaborated on points made by his Deputy
                            <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Krasulin</persName> (<gloss
                            target="#t_REFReftel_1">reftel</gloss>), but with some interesting
                        fillips.</p>
                    <p>3. Flipping jovially through the first sections of the document, <persName
                            corresp="#p_TRM_1">Timerbayev</persName> said that “naturally” the main
                        point is to stop the arms race, and that “of course” the first task is to
                        sign a universal treaty on non-use of force as rapidly as possible. The
                        Soviets have also gone public with “what you already knew” from experts’
                        discussions on weapons of mass destruction and verification of stockpile
                        destruction for chemical weapons.</p>
                    <p>4. More seriously, he continued, new elements in two areas are worthy of
                        attention: the reference to limitations on conventional armaments, which had
                        not appeared for several years (outside the limited context of <persName
                            corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s remarks on the Middle East in
                        the 25th Congress reports; and the willingness to discuss a conference, on
                        the one hand, and military “activities,” on the other, in the Indian
                        Ocean.</p>
                    <p>5. Finally, he said, there was the question of <gloss target="#t_CTB_1"
                            >CTB</gloss> verification. It had not been spelled out in the
                        memorandum, and (he repeated several times) the Soviets do not have a draft
                        text to present, but they are willing to enter into immediate discussion of
                        a text which would provide parties to the treaty with assurances that
                        natural seismic events are not nuclear explosions. What they have in mind,
                        he said, is the “Swedish idea” of voluntary on-site inspection conducted by
                        treaty parties who present evidence supporting concern that a seismic event
                        is not, in fact, natural. The suspected state would be free not to accept
                        on-site inspection; in that case, however, the suspecting state could
                        present additional concrete evidence, and, if it were still not accepted as
                        a valid reason for inspection, they might concert action with others who
                        suspected a violation or appeal to public opinion with their evidence to
                        bring pressure on the suspected nation to assent to inspection.</p>
                    <p>6. Asked what format he envisaged for negotiation of such a treaty, <persName
                            corresp="#p_TRM_1">Timerbayev</persName> replied that there is a <gloss
                            target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolution calling for negotiation by all
                        five nuclear powers—“all five,” he repeated—and by the twenty-five or thirty
                        other states which might be interested. The Soviet Union, he added with a
                        smile, is ready to start tomorrow, “or January 21,” in New York or even in
                        Shanghai.</p>
                    <pb n="683" facs="0717" xml:id="pg_683"/>
                    <p>7. Asked whether he could envisage any half steps between current conditions
                        and the full <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> he was describing,
                            <persName corresp="#p_TRM_1">Timerbayev</persName> said there was of
                        course a problem, which the Soviets recognize, with extending the <gloss
                            target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> regime downward. The Soviets would like to
                        maintain the possibility of <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>’s not only
                        for themselves but for non-nuclear states, but there are obviously many
                        technical obstacles, in this regard, to negotiating the kind of <gloss
                            target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> they have in mind. Nevertheless, the
                        agreement signed May 28 “provides a good basis” for exploring these issues.
                        The Soviets have no fixed ideas or texts, he stressed in conclusion: the
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA_2">Gromyko</persName> offer is meant to
                        facilitate the opening of <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> negotiations
                        during which all aspects could be examined in detail.</p>

                    <p>We have known since the age of nuclear energy began more than 30 years ago
                        that this source of energy had the potential for tremendous benefits for
                        mankind and the potential for unparalleled destruction.</p>
                    <p>On the one hand, there is no doubt that nuclear energy represents one of the
                        best hopes for satisfying the rising world demand for energy with minimum
                        environmental impact and with the potential for reducing dependence on
                        uncertain and diminishing world supplies of oil.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, nuclear fuel, as it produces power also produces
                        plutonium, which can be chemically separated from the spent fuel. The
                        plutonium can be recycled and used to generate additional nuclear power,
                        thereby partially offsetting the need for additional energy resources.
                        Unfortunately—and this is the root of the problem—the same plutonium
                        produced in nuclear powerplants can, when chemically separated, also be used
                        to make nuclear explosives.</p>
                    <pb n="684" facs="0718" xml:id="pg_684"/>
                    <p>The world community cannot afford to let potential nuclear weapons material
                        or the technology to produce it proliferate uncontrolled over the globe. The
                        world community must ensure that production and utilization of such material
                        by any nation is carried out under the most stringent security conditions
                        and arrangements.</p>
                    <p>Developing the enormous benefits of nuclear energy while simultaneously
                        developing the means to prevent proliferation is one of the major challenges
                        facing all nations of the world today.</p>
                    <p>The standards we apply in judging most domestic and international activities
                        are not sufficiently rigorous to deal with this extraordinarily complex
                        problem. Our answers cannot be partially successful. They will either work,
                        in which case we shall stop proliferation, or they will fail and nuclear
                        proliferation will accelerate as nations initially having no intention of
                        acquiring nuclear weapons conclude that they are forced to do so by the
                        actions of others. Should this happen, we would face a world in which the
                        security of all is critically imperiled. Maintaining international stability
                        in such an environment would be incalculably difficult and dangerous. In
                        times of regional or global crisis, risks of nuclear devastation would be
                        immeasurably increased—if not through direct attack, then through a process
                        of ever-expanding escalation. The problem can be handled as long as we
                        understand it clearly and act wisely in concert with other nations. But we
                        are faced with a threat of tragedy if we fail to comprehend it or to take
                        effective measures.</p>
                    <p>Thus the seriousness and complexity of the problem place a special burden on
                        those who propose ways to control proliferation. They must avoid the
                        temptation for rhetorical gestures, empty threats, or righteous posturing.
                        They must offer policies and programs which deal with the world as it is,
                        not as we might wish it to be. The goal is to prevent proliferation, not
                        simply to deplore it.</p>
                    <p>The first task in dealing with the problem of proliferation is to understand
                        the world nuclear situation.</p>
                    <p>More than 30 nations have or plan to build nuclear powerplants to reap the
                        benefits of nuclear energy. The 1973 energy crisis dramatically demonstrated
                        to all nations not only the dangers of excessive reliance on oil imports but
                        also the reality that the world’s supply of fossil fuels is running out. As
                        a result, nuclear energy is now properly seen by many nations as an
                        indispensable way to satisfy rising energy demand without prematurely
                        depleting finite fossil fuel resources. We must understand the motives which
                        are leading these nations, developed and developing, to place even greater
                        emphasis than we do on nuclear power development. For unless we comprehend
                        their real needs, we cannot expect to find ways of working with them to
                        ensure satisfaction of both our and their legitimate concerns. Moreover,
                        several nations besides the United States have the technology needed to
                        produce both <pb n="685" facs="0719" xml:id="pg_685"/>the benefits and the
                        destructive potential of nuclear energy. Nations with such capabilities are
                        able to export their technology and facilities.</p>
                    <p>Thus, no single nation, not even the United States, can realistically hope—by
                        itself—to control effectively the spread of reprocessing technology and the
                        resulting availability of plutonium.</p>
                    <p>The United States once was the dominant world supplier of nuclear material
                        equipment and technology. While we remain a leader in this field, other
                        suppliers have come to share the international market—with the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> now supplying less than half of nuclear
                        reactor exports. In short, for nearly a decade the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> has not had a monopoly on nuclear technology. Although our
                        role is large, we are not able to control worldwide nuclear development.</p>
                    <p>For these reasons, action to control proliferation must be an international
                        cooperative effort involving many nations, including both nuclear suppliers
                        and customers. Common standards must be developed and accepted by all
                        parties. If this is not done, unrestrained trade in sensitive nuclear
                        technology and materials will develop—with no one in a position to stop
                        it.</p>
                    <p>We in the United States must recognize that interests in nuclear energy vary
                        widely among nations. We must recognize that some nations look to nuclear
                        energy because they have no acceptable energy alternative. We must be sure
                        that our efforts to control proliferation are not viewed by such nations as
                        an act to prevent them from enjoying the benefits of nuclear energy. We must
                        be sure that all nations recognize that the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> believes that nonproliferation objectives must take
                        precedence over economic and energy benefits if a choice must be made.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Previous Action</p>
                    <p>During the past 30 years, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has been
                        the unquestioned leader in worldwide efforts to assure that the benefits of
                        nuclear energy are made available widely while its destructive uses are
                        prevented. I have given special attention to these objectives during the
                        past 2 years, and we have made important new progress, particularly in
                        efforts to control the proliferation of nuclear weapons capability among the
                        nations of the world.</p>
                    <p>In 1974, soon after I assumed office, I became concerned that some nuclear
                        supplier countries, in order to achieve competitive advantage, were prepared
                        to offer nuclear exports under conditions less rigorous than we believe
                        prudent. In the fall of that year, at the United Nations General Assembly,
                        the United States proposed that nonproliferation measures be strengthened
                        materially. I also expressed my concern directly to my counterparts in key
                        supplier and recipient nations. I directed the Secretary of State to
                        emphasize multilateral action to limit this dangerous form of
                        competition.</p>
                    <pb n="686" facs="0720" xml:id="pg_686"/>
                    <p>At <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> initiative, the first meeting of
                        major nuclear suppliers was convened in London in April 1975. A series of
                        meetings and intensive bilateral consultations followed. As a result of
                        these meetings, we have significantly raised international standards through
                        progressive new guidelines to govern nuclear exports. These involve both
                        improved safeguards and controls to prevent diversion of nuclear materials
                        and to guard against the misuse of nuclear technology and physical
                        protection against theft and sabotage. The United States has adopted these
                        guidelines as policy for nuclear exports.</p>
                    <p>In addition, we have acted to deal with the special dangers associated with
                        plutonium.</p>
                    <p>—We have prohibited export of reprocessing and other nuclear technologies
                        that could contribute to proliferation.</p>
                    <p>—We have firmly opposed reprocessing in Korea and Taiwan. We welcome the
                        decisions of those nations to forego such activities. We will continue to
                        discourage national reprocessing in other locations of particular
                        concern.</p>
                    <p>—We negotiated agreements for cooperation with Egypt and Israel which contain
                        the strictest reprocessing provisions and other nuclear controls ever
                        included in the 20-year history of our nuclear cooperation program.</p>
                    <p>—In addition, the United States recently completed negotiations to place its
                        civil nuclear facilities under the safeguards of the International Atomic
                        Energy Agency—and the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> has approved a
                        proposed agreement for this purpose.</p>
                    <p rend="center">New Initiatives</p>
                    <p>Last summer, I directed that a thorough review be undertaken of all our
                        nuclear policies and options to determine what further steps were needed. I
                        have considered carefully the results of that review, held discussions with
                        congressional leaders, and benefited from consultations with leaders of
                        other nations. I have decided that new steps are needed, building upon the
                        progress of the past 2 years. Today, I am announcing a number of actions and
                        proposals aimed at:</p>
                    <p>—strengthening the commitment of the nations of the world to the goal of
                        nonproliferation and building an effective system of international controls
                        to prevent proliferation;</p>
                    <p>—changing and strengthening <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> domestic
                        nuclear policies and programs to support our nonproliferation goals; and</p>
                    <p>—establishing, by these actions, a sound foundation for the continued and
                        increased use of nuclear energy in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        and in the world in a safe and economic manner.</p>
                    <pb n="687" facs="0721" xml:id="pg_687"/>
                    <p>The task we face calls for an international cooperative venture of
                        unprecedented dimensions. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is
                        prepared to work with all other nations.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Principal Policy Decisions</p>
                    <p>I have concluded that the reprocessing and recycling of plutonium should not
                        proceed unless there is sound reason to conclude that the world community
                        can effectively overcome the associated risks of proliferation. I believe
                        that avoidance of proliferation must take precedence over economic
                        interests. I have also concluded that the United States and other nations
                        can and should increase their use of nuclear power for peaceful purposes
                        even if reprocessing and recycling of plutonium are found to be
                        unacceptable.</p>
                    <p>Vigorous action is required domestically and internationally to make these
                        judgments effective.</p>
                    <p>—I have decided that the United States should greatly accelerate its
                        diplomatic initiatives in conjunction with nuclear supplier and consumer
                        nations to control the spread of plutonium and technologies for separating
                        plutonium.</p>
                    <p>Effective nonproliferation measures will require the participation and
                        support of nuclear suppliers and consumers. There must be coordination in
                        restraints so that an effective nonproliferation system is achieved, and
                        there must be cooperation in assuring reliable fuel supplies so that
                        peaceful energy needs are met.</p>
                    <p>—I have decided that the United States should no longer regard reprocessing
                        of used nuclear fuel to produce plutonium as a necessary and inevitable step
                        in the nuclear fuel cycle, and that we should pursue reprocessing and
                        recycling in the future only if they are found to be consistent with our
                        international objectives.</p>
                    <p>We must ensure that our domestic policies and programs are compatible with
                        our international position on reprocessing and that we work closely with
                        other nations in evaluating nuclear fuel reprocessing.</p>
                    <p>—The steps I am announcing today will assure that the necessary increase in
                        our use of nuclear energy will be carried on with safety and without
                        aggravating the danger of proliferation.</p>
                    <p>Even with strong efforts to conserve, we will have increasing demands for
                        energy for a growing American economy. To satisfy these needs, we must rely
                        on increased use of both nuclear energy and coal until more acceptable
                        alternatives are developed. We will continue pushing ahead with work on all
                        promising alternatives such as solar energy but now we must count on the
                        technology that works. We cannot expect a major contribution to our energy
                        supply from alternative technologies until late in this century.</p>
                    <pb n="688" facs="0722" xml:id="pg_688"/>
                    <p>To implement my overall policy decisions, I have decided on a number of
                        policies that are necessary and appropriate to meet our nonproliferation and
                        energy objectives.</p>
                    <p>—First, our domestic policies must be changed to conform to my decision on
                        deferral of the commercialization of chemical reprocessing of nuclear fuel
                        which results in the separation of plutonium.</p>
                    <p>—Second, I call upon all nations to join us in exercising maximum restraint
                        in the transfer of reprocessing and enrichment technology and facilities by
                        avoiding such sensitive exports or commitments for a period of at least 3
                        years.</p>
                    <p>—Third, new cooperative steps are needed to help assure that all nations have
                        an adequate and reliable supply of energy for their needs. I believe, most
                        importantly, that nuclear supplier nations have a special obligation to
                        assure that customer nations have an adequate supply of fuel for their
                        nuclear powerplants, if those customer nations forego the acquisition of
                        reprocessing and uranium enrichment capabilities and accept effective
                        proliferation controls.</p>
                    <p>—Fourth, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> must maintain its role as a
                        major and reliable world supplier of nuclear reactors and fuel for peaceful
                        purposes. Our strong position as a supplier has provided the principal basis
                        for our influence and leadership in worldwide nonproliferation efforts. A
                        strong position will be equally important in the future. While reaffirming
                        this Nation’s intent to be a reliable supplier, the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> seeks no competitive advantage by virtue of the worldwide
                        system of effective nonproliferation controls that I am calling for
                        today.</p>
                    <p>—Fifth, new efforts must be made to urge all nations to join in a full-scale
                        international cooperative effort—which I shall outline in detail—to develop
                        a system of effective controls to prevent proliferation.</p>
                    <p>—Sixth, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> must take new steps with
                        respect to its own exports to control proliferation, while seeking to
                        improve multilateral guidelines.</p>
                    <p>—Seventh, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> must undertake a program
                        to evaluate reprocessing in support of the international policies I have
                        adopted.</p>
                    <p>—Finally, I have concluded that new steps are needed to assure that we have
                        in place when needed, both in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and
                        around the world, the facilities for the long-term storage or disposal of
                        nuclear wastes.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Actions To Implement Our Nuclear Policies</p>
                    <p>In order to implement the nuclear policies that I have outlined, major
                        efforts will be required within the United States and by the many nations
                        around the world with an interest in nuclear energy. To move forward with
                        these efforts, I am today taking a number of actions and making a number of
                        proposals to other nations.</p>

                    <p>With respect to nuclear fuel reprocessing, I am directing agencies of the
                        executive branch to implement my decision to delay commercialization of
                        reprocessing activities in the United States until uncertainties are
                        resolved. Specifically, I am:</p>
                    <p>—Directing the Administrator of the Energy Research and Development

                        heretofore have been based on the assumption that reprocessing would
                        proceed;</p>
                    <p>• encourage prompt action to expand spent fuel storage facilities, thus
                        assuring utilities that they need not be concerned about shutdown of nuclear
                        reactors because of delays; and</p>
                    <p>• identify the research and development efforts needed to investigate the
                        feasibility of recovering the energy value from used nuclear fuel without

                        dangers posed by reprocessing and the prospect of uncontrolled availability
                        of plutonium require further, decisive international action. Effective
                        control of the parallel risk of spreading uranium enrichment technology is
                        also necessary. To meet these dangers:</p>

                        years.</p>
                    <p>This will allow suppliers and consumers to work together to establish
                        reliable means for meeting nuclear needs with minimum risk, as we assess
                        carefully the wisdom of plutonium use. As we proceed in these efforts, we
                        must not be influenced by pressures to approve the export of these sensitive

                        assured supply of nuclear fuel, even though the number and location of
                        sensitive facilities to generate this fuel is limited to meet
                        nonproliferation goals. The availability of fuel-cycle services in several
                        different nations can provide ample assurance to consumers of a continuing
                        and stable source of supply.</p>
                    <pb n="690" facs="0724" xml:id="pg_690"/>
                    <p>It is also desirable to continue studying the idea of a few suitably-sited
                        multinational fuel-cycle centers to serve regional needs, when effectively
                        safeguarded and economically warranted. Through these and related means, we
                        can minimize incentives for the spread of dangerous fuel-cycle
                        capabilities.</p>
                    <p>The United States stands ready to take action, in cooperation with other
                        concerned nations, to assure reliable supplies of nuclear fuel at equitable
                        prices to any country accepting responsible restraints on its nuclear power
                        program with regard to reprocessing, plutonium disposition, and enrichment
                        technology.</p>
                    <p>—I am directing the Secretary of State to initiate consultations to explore
                        with other nations arrangements for coordinating fuel services and for
                        developing other means of ensuring that suppliers will be able to offer, and
                        consumers will be able to receive, an uninterrupted and economical supply of
                        low-enriched uranium fuel and fuel services.</p>
                    <p>These discussions will address ways to ensure against economic disadvantage
                        to cooperating nations and to remove any sources of competition which could
                        undermine our common nonproliferation efforts.</p>
                    <p>To contribute to this initiative, the United States will offer binding
                        letters of intent for the supply of nuclear fuel to current and prospective
                        customers willing to accept such responsible restraints.</p>
                    <p>—In addition, I am directing the Secretary of State to enter into
                        negotiations or arrangements for mutual agreement on disposition of spent
                        fuel with consumer nations that adopt responsible restraints.</p>
                    <p>Where appropriate, the United States will provide consumer nations with
                        either fresh, low-enriched uranium fuel or make other equitable arrangements
                        in return for mutual agreement on the disposition of spent fuel where such
                        disposition demonstrably fosters our common and cooperative nonproliferation
                        objectives. The United States seeks no commercial advantage in pursuing
                        options for fuel disposition and assured fuel supplies.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the United States will continue to expand cooperative efforts with
                        other countries in developing their indigenous nonnuclear energy
                        resources.</p>
                    <p>The United States has proposed and continues to advocate the establishment of
                        an International Energy Institute, specifically designed to help developing
                        countries match the most economic and readily available sources of energy to
                        their power needs. Through this Institute and other appropriate means, we
                        will offer technological assistance in the development of indigenous energy
                        resources.</p>

                            >U.S.</gloss> Role as a Reliable Supplier</p>
                    <p>If the United States is to continue its leadership role in worldwide
                        nonproliferation efforts, it must be a reliable supplier of nuclear reactors
                            <pb n="691" facs="0725" xml:id="pg_691"/>and fuel for peaceful purposes.
                        There are two principal actions we can take to contribute to this
                        objective:</p>
                    <p>—I will submit to the new Congress proposed legislation that will permit the
                        expansion of capacity in the United States to produce enriched uranium,
                        including the authority needed for expansion of the government-owned plant
                        at Portsmouth, Ohio. I will also work with Congress to establish a framework
                        for a private, competitive industry to finance, build, own, and operate
                        enrichment plants.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> capacity has been fully committed since
                        mid-1974 with the result that no new orders could be signed. The Congress
                        did not act on my full proposal and provided only limited and temporary
                        authority for proceeding with the Portsmouth plant. We must have additional
                        authority to proceed with the expansion of capacity without further
                        delay.</p>
                    <p>—I will work closely with the Congress to ensure that legislation for
                        improving our export controls results in a system that provides maximum
                        assurance that the United States will be a reliable supplier to other
                        nations for the full period of agreements.</p>
                    <p>One of the principal concerns with export legislation proposed in the last
                        Congress was the fear that foreign customers could be subjected to arbitrary
                        new controls imposed well after a long-term agreement and specific contracts
                        for nuclear powerplants and fuel had been signed. In the case of nuclear
                        plants and fuel, reliable long-term agreements are essential, and we must
                        adopt export controls that provide reliability while meeting
                        nonproliferation objectives.</p>

                        <hi rend="roman">V.</hi> International Controls Against Proliferation</p>
                    <p>To reinforce the foregoing policies, we must develop means to establish
                        international restraints over the accumulation of plutonium itself, whether
                        in separated form or in unprocessed spent fuel. The accumulation of
                        plutonium under national control, especially in a separated form, is a
                        primary proliferation risk.</p>
                    <p>—I am directing the Secretary of State to pursue vigorously discussions aimed
                        at the establishment of a new international regime to provide for storage of
                        civil plutonium and spent reactor fuel.</p>
                    <p>The United States made this proposal to the International Atomic Energy
                        Agency and other interested nations last spring.</p>
                    <p>Creation of such a regime will greatly strengthen world confidence that the
                        growing accumulation of excess plutonium and spent fuel can be stored
                        safely, pending reentry into the nuclear fuel cycle or other safe
                        disposition. I urge the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>, which is
                        empowered to establish plutonium depositories, to give prompt implementation
                        to this concept.</p>
                    <p>Once a broadly representative <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> storage
                        regime is in operation, we are prepared to place our own excess civil
                        plutonium and spent <pb n="692" facs="0726" xml:id="pg_692"/>fuel under its
                        control. Moreover, we are prepared to consider providing a site for
                        international storage under <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>
                        auspices.</p>
                    <p>The inspection system of the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> remains a
                        key element in our entire non-proliferation strategy. The world community
                        must make sure that the Agency has the technical and human resources needed
                        to keep pace with its expanding responsibilities. At my direction, we have
                        recently committed substantial additional resources to help upgrade the
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>’s technical safeguards
                        capabilities, and I believe we must strengthen further the safeguard
                        functions of the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>—I am directing the Secretary of State and Administrator of <gloss
                            target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss> to undertake a major international
                        effort to ensure that adequate resources for this purpose are made
                        available, and that we mobilize our best scientific talent to support that
                        Agency. Our principal national laboratories with expertise in this area have
                        been directed to provide assistance, on a continuing basis, to the <gloss
                            target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> Secretariat.</p>
                    <p>The terrible increase in violence and terrorism throughout the world has
                        sharpened our awareness of the need to assure rigorous protection for
                        sensitive nuclear materials and equipment. Fortunately, the need to cope
                        with this problem is now broadly recognized. Many nations have responded to
                        the initiatives which I have taken in this area by materially strengthening
                        their physical security and by cooperating in the development of
                        international guidelines by the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>. As a
                        result of consultations among the major suppliers, provision for adequate
                        physical security is becoming a normal condition of supply.</p>
                    <p>We have an effective physical security system in the United States. But steps
                        are needed to upgrade physical security systems and to assure timely
                        international collaboration in the recovery of lost or stolen materials.</p>
                    <p>—I have directed the Secretary of State to address vigorously the problem of
                        physical security at both bilateral and multilateral levels, including
                        exploration of a possible international convention.</p>
                    <p>The United States is committed to the development of the system of
                        international controls that I have here outlined. Even when complete,
                        however, no system of controls is likely to be effective if a potential
                        violator judges that his acquisition of a nuclear explosive will be received
                        with indifference by the international community.</p>
                    <p>Any material violation of a nuclear safeguards agreement—especially the
                        diversion of nuclear material for use in making explosives—must be
                        universally judged to be an extremely serious affront to the world
                        community, calling for the immediate imposition of drastic sanctions.</p>
                    <p>—I serve notice today that the United States will, at a minimum, respond to
                        violation by any nation of any safeguards agreement to <pb n="693"
                            facs="0727" xml:id="pg_693"/>which we are a party with an immediate
                        cutoff of our supply of nuclear fuel and cooperation to that nation.</p>
                    <p>We would consider further steps, not necessarily confined to the area of
                        nuclear cooperation, against the violator nation. Nor will our actions be
                        limited to violations of agreements in which we are directly involved. In
                        the event of material violation of any safeguards agreement, particularly
                        agreements with the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>, we will initiate
                        immediate consultations with all interested nations to determine appropriate
                        action.</p>
                    <p>Universal recognition of the total unacceptability of the abrogation or
                        violation of any nonproliferation agreements is one of the most important
                        steps which can be taken to prevent further proliferation. We invite all
                        concerned governments to affirm publicly that they will regard nuclear
                        wrongdoing as an intolerable violation of acceptable norms of international
                        behavior, which would set in motion strong and immediate
                        countermeasures.</p>

                        <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Nuclear Export Policies</p>
                    <p>During the past 2 years, the United States has strengthened its own national
                        nuclear export policies. Our interests, however, are not limited to controls
                        alone. The United States has a special responsibility to share the benefits
                        of peaceful nuclear energy with other countries. We have sought to serve
                        other nations as a reliable supplier of nuclear fuel and equipment. Given
                        the choice between economic benefits and progress toward our
                        nonproliferation goals, we have given, and will continue to give priority to
                        nonproliferation. But there should be no incompatibility between
                        nonproliferation and assisting other nations in enjoying the benefits of
                        peaceful nuclear power if all supplier countries pursue common nuclear
                        export policies. There is need, however, for even more rigorous controls
                        than those now commonly employed, and for policies that favor nations
                        accepting responsible nonproliferation limitations.</p>
                    <p>—I have decided that we will henceforth apply new criteria in judging whether
                        to enter into new or expanded nuclear cooperation:</p>
                    <p>• Adherence to the nonproliferation treaty will be a strong positive factor
                        favoring cooperation with a nonnuclear weapon state.</p>
                    <p>• Nonnuclear weapons states that have not yet adhered to the nonproliferation
                        treaty will receive positive recognition if they are prepared to submit to
                        full fuel cycle safeguards, pending adherence.</p>
                    <p>• We will favor recipient nations that are prepared to forego, or postpone
                        for a substantial period, the establishment of national reprocessing or
                        enrichment activities or, in certain cases, prepared to shape and schedule
                        their reprocessing and enriching facilities to foster nonproliferation
                        needs.</p>
                    <p>• Positive recognition will also be given to nations prepared to participate
                        in an international storage regime, under which spent fuel and any separated
                        plutonium would be placed pending use.</p>
                    <pb n="694" facs="0728" xml:id="pg_694"/>
                    <p>Exceptional cases may occur in which nonproliferation will be served best by
                        cooperating with nations not yet meeting these tests. However, I pledge that
                        the Congress will not be asked to approve any new or amended agreement not
                        meeting these new criteria unless I personally determine that the agreement
                        is fully supportive of our nonproliferation goals. In case of such a
                        determination, my reasons will be fully presented to the Congress.</p>
                    <p>—With respect to countries that are current recipients of <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> nuclear supply, I am directing the
                        Secretary of State to enter into negotiations with the objective of
                        conforming these agreements to established international guidelines, and to
                        seek through diplomatic initiatives and fuel supply incentives to obtain
                        their acceptance of our new criteria.</p>
                    <p>We must recognize the need for effective multilateral approaches to
                        nonproliferation and prevent nuclear export controls from becoming an
                        element of commercial competition.</p>
                    <p>—I am directing the Secretary of State to intensify discussions with other
                        nuclear suppliers aimed at expanding common guidelines for peaceful
                        cooperative agreements so that they conform with these criteria.</p>
                    <p>In this regard, the United States would discuss ways of developing incentives
                        that can lead to acceptance of these criteria, such as assuring reliable
                        fuel supplies for nations accepting new restraints.</p>
                    <p>The reliability of American assurances to other nations is an asset that few,
                        if any, nations of the world can match. It must not be eroded. Indeed,
                        nothing could more prejudice our efforts to strengthen our existing
                        nonproliferation understandings than arbitrary suspension or unwarranted

                    <p>Despite my personal efforts, the 94th Congress adjourned without passing
                        nuclear export legislation which would have strengthened our effectiveness

                        process.</p>
                    <p>I will continue to work to develop bipartisan support in Congress for

                    <p>The area of our domestic nuclear program dealing with long-term management of
                        nuclear wastes from our commercial nuclear powerplants has not in the past
                        received sufficient attention. In my 1977 Budget, I proposed a fourfold
                        increase in funding for this program, which involves the activities of
                        several Federal agencies. We recently completed a review to determine what
                        additional actions are needed to assure availability in the mid-1980’s of a
                        federally-owned and managed repository for long-term nuclear wastes, well
                        before significant quantities of wastes begin to accumulate.</p>
                    <p>I have been assured that the technology for long-term management or disposal
                        of nuclear wastes is available but demonstrations are needed.</p>
                    <p>—I have directed the Administrator of <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss>
                        to take the necessary action to speed up this program so as to demonstrate
                        all components of waste management technology by 1978 and to demonstrate a
                        complete repository for such wastes by 1985.</p>
                    <p>—I have further directed that the first demonstration depository for
                        high-level wastes which will be owned by the government be submitted for
                        licensing by the independent <gloss target="#t_NRC_1">NRC</gloss> to assure
                        its safety and acceptability to the public.</p>
                    <p>In view of the decisions announced today, I have also directed the
                        Administrator of <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss> to assure that the
                        waste repository will be able to handle spent fuel elements as well as the
                        separated and solidified waste that would result if we proceed with nuclear
                        fuel reprocessing.</p>
                    <p>The United States continues to provide world leadership in nuclear waste
                        management. I am inviting other nations to participate in and learn from our
                        programs.</p>

                    <p>—I am directing the Secretary of State to discuss with other nations and the
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> the possibility of establishing
                        centrally located, multinationally controlled nuclear waste repositories so
                        that the number of sites that are needed can be limited.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Increased Use of Nuclear Energy in the United States</p>
                    <p>Even with strong conservation efforts, energy demands in the United States
                        will continue to increase in response to the needs of a growing economy. The
                        only alternative over the next 15 to 20 years to increased use of both
                        nuclear energy and coal is greater reliance on imported oil which will
                        jeopardize our Nation’s strength and welfare.</p>
                    <p>We now have in the United States 62 licensed nuclear plants, providing about
                        9 percent of our electrical energy. By 1985, we will have from 145 to 160
                        plants, supplying 20 percent or more of the Nation’s electricity.</p>
                    <p>In many cases, electricity from nuclear plants is markedly cheaper than that
                        produced from either oil or coal-fired plants. Nuclear energy is
                        environmentally preferable in a number of respects to other principal ways
                        of generating electricity.</p>
                    <p>Commercial nuclear power has an excellent safety record, with nearly 200
                        plant-years of experience (compiled over 18 chronological years) without a
                        single death from a nuclear accident. I have acted to assure that this
                        record is maintained in the years ahead. For example, I have increased funds
                        for the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission and for the Energy
                        Research and Development Administration for reactor safety research and
                        development.</p>
                    <p>The decisions and actions I am announcing today will help overcome the
                        uncertainties that have served to delay the expanded use of nuclear energy
                        in the United States. While the decision to delay reprocessing is
                        significant, it will not prevent us from increasing our use of nuclear
                        energy. We are on the right course with our nuclear power program in
                        America. The changes I am announcing today will ensure that we continue.</p>
                    <p>My decisions today do not affect the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        program of research and development on the breeder reactor. That program
                        assumes that no decision on the commercial operations of breeder reactors,
                        which require plutonium fuel, will be made before 1986.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Conclusion</p>
                    <p>I do not underestimate the challenge represented in the creation of a
                        worldwide program that will permit capturing the benefits of nuclear energy
                        while maintaining needed protection against nuclear proliferation. The
                        challenge is one that can be managed only partially and temporarily by
                        technical measures.</p>
                    <pb n="697" facs="0731" xml:id="pg_697"/>
                    <p>It can be managed fully if the task is faced realistically by nations
                        prepared to forego perceived short-term advantages in favor of fundamental
                        long-term gains. We call upon all nations to recognize that their individual
                        and collective interests are best served by internationally assured and
                        safeguarded nuclear fuel supply, services, and storage. We ask them to turn
                        aside from pursuing nuclear capabilities which are of doubtful economic
                        value and have ominous implications for nuclear proliferation and
                        instability in the world.</p>
                    <p>The growing international consensus against the proliferation of nuclear
                        weapons is a source of encouragement. But it is certainly not a basis for
                        complacency.</p>
                    <p>Success in meeting the challenge now before us depends on an extraordinary
                        coordination of the policies of all nations toward the common good. The
                        United States is prepared to lead, but we cannot succeed alone. If nations
                        can work together constructively and cooperatively to manage our common
                        nuclear problems, we will enhance our collective security. And we will be
                        better able to concentrate our energies and our resources on the great tasks
                        of construction rather than consume them in increasingly dangerous
                        rivalry.</p>

                        1978 request for appropriations funding the amount of $15.3 million to

                        Arsenal and some $13.3 million to purchase production-related equipment.
                        This would be a long-range program requiring two years before the facility

                    <p>(C) Over the years, <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> ability to deter
                        Soviet use of <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> through the threat of
                        retaliation in kind has steadily decreased. At the same time, intelligence
                        reveals that the Soviets have continued to emphasize operations on a
                        chemical battlefield. While their intentions concerning the first use of
                            <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> are not entirely clear, the fact that
                        they are able to launch a chemical attack against <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss> in depth presents a serious threat to allied forces.
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> forces require a credible <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> retaliatory capability in order to deter the
                        Soviets from using chemicals and possibly lowering the nuclear threshold as
                        a result.</p>
                    <p>(C) The Department of Defense is fully supportive of the principles behind
                        the ongoing arms control negotiations in the area of <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss>. However, we are aware that there has been little positive
                        movement toward achieving an effective agreement. In our view, a primary
                        reason for Soviet intractability is the fact that they see no real advantage
                        in giving up their superior capability. Thus, <gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                            >DOD</gloss> sees two significant advantages accruing from the
                        appropriation of funds for the long lead-time binary production items
                        requested by the Army: (1) The appropriations would preserve our options
                        concerning future modernization of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> stockpile and (2) it would provide a
                        strong, but by no means provocative, signal to the Soviets that the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is prepared to rebuild its <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> capability if an effective arms control
                        agreement cannot be reached.</p>
                    <p>(U) In this regard, <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> has prepared the
                        attached position paper which outlines the essential elements of an

                    </list>
                    <p>(C) The principal obstacle to achieving an acceptable <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss> arms limitation is the inability to satisfactorily verify
                        compliance with a prohibition whether it includes production, stockpiling or
                        deployment, or any combination thereof. Regardless of the nature and scope
                        of the prohibition, current verification techniques are limited in
                        effectiveness and there is no method of detecting clandestine <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> activities. Further, the dual
                        civilian-military nature of chemical production is such that even if all
                        production would be monitored, there would be no way to prevent
                        technological developments which could be applied to <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss> in future conflicts. This means that any <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> agreement will hold a degree of risk. The
                        task then in drafting any agreement is to limit this risk as much as
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>(C) The Biological Warfare Convention (<gloss target="#t_BWC_1">BWC</gloss>)
                        is a good example of an agreement which incorporates a high degree of “risk”
                        and, therefore, represents a model of what a <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss> agreement should <hi rend="italic">not</hi> allow. The
                        circumstances surrounding the ratification of the <gloss target="#t_BWC_1"
                            >BWC</gloss> were entirely different than those affecting <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>,<note n="2" xml:id="d216fn2">There were
                            several factors involved in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            decision to sign an unverifiable <gloss target="#t_BW_1">BW</gloss>
                            treaty. Principal among these were (1) the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> had renounced unilaterally the use of <gloss
                                target="#t_BW_1">BW</gloss> and (2) <gloss target="#t_BW_1"
                                >BW</gloss> was not considered a particularly efficient weapon since
                            it was difficult to control and presented significant logistical
                            problems which generally outweighed its effectiveness. These factors do
                            not apply to <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> which are effective
                            tactical weapons currently stocked by <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> with a history of use. [Footnote is in the original.]
                        </note> but nevertheless our experiences regarding Soviet compliance with
                        the provisions of this Convention must prompt caution in <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> negotiations. It is clear that the
                        verification provisions of any meaningful agreement must be carefully worked
                        out and worded and clearly understood by all. Available intelligence reveals
                        that even though the Soviets may be meeting the literal requirements of the
                            <gloss target="#t_BWC_1">BWC</gloss>, they are probably exploiting fully
                        the loopholes that exist and are violating the spirit of the agreement. This
                        may in time require serious consideration of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> counteraction if we are to protect our forces against
                        Soviet <gloss target="#t_BW_1">BW</gloss> capabilities. In any case, an
                        eventual <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> agreement must insure that there
                        are no compliance loopholes.</p>
                    <pb n="700" facs="0734" xml:id="pg_700"/>
                    <p>(C) In the political arena, any attempt to negotiate a prohibition which did
                        not call ultimately for a comprehensive prohibition would be unacceptable
                        and probably would result in a successful negotiation by other countries of
                        an agreement which would be undesirable from our standpoint. Thus, any
                        acceptable agreement text would require a <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> (and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>) commitment to
                        ban <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> totally at some point in time.</p>
                    <p>(C) Given the above, in order to minimize the risk, we should present a
                        gradual phased approach which would proceed over several years. This would
                        allow for the possible development of more effective verification techniques
                        while, at the same time, providing an opportunity to build confidence that
                        the major parties intend to comply with the treaty provisions. Two essential
                        elements of any <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> agreement, regardless of
                        how it was phased, would be (1) a provision for withdrawal in the event a
                        significant <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> threat developed from lack of
                        progress or compliance, and (2) procedures to allow the mandatory onsite
                        inspection of suspected violations on a challenge basis.</p>
                    <p>(C) An outline of the essential elements of a <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss> arms limitation which could be acceptable to the <gloss
                            target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> is provided below. Details will require an
                        interagency study and agreement.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Phasing</hi>. The agreement would encompass a gradual
                        phased approach to the destruction of stocks and production facilities over
                        a period of approximately 10 years (the specifics would depend on several
                        factors, including the capability to demilitarize stocks taking
                        environmental considerations into account). At the end of the agreed period,
                        all parties would have zero <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> stocks and no
                        useful <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> production facilities.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Coverage</hi>. An agreement should cover, as a minimum,
                        all lethal <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> agents initially. It could
                        eventually cover <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> incapacitants, as well.
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> does not consider riot control
                        agents and herbicides as <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> agents and these
                        would not be covered.</p>

                            over a period of eight years, preferably in equal increments annually.
                            All <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> stocks would be declared at the
                            time of ratification and the location and composition of stockpiles
                            identified and verified.</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">Production</hi>. All production would be prohibited
                            unless a party withdrew from the agreement. Production facilities would
                            be declared and placed in a stand-by status at time of ratification.
                            Modernization and maintenance of facilities would be allowed subject to
                            inspection. Facilities would be destroyed or converted to peaceful
                            purposes during the ninth and tenth years of the treaty.</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">Research and Development</hi>. There would be no

                            auspices and the agreement should provide for such an organization.
                            Confirmation of declared stockpiles would also be accomplished under
                            international auspices.</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">On-site Inspection</hi>. The agreement would include a

                            challenge basis. Challenges would be subject to screening by an
                            international oversight group under agreed procedures in order to
                            eliminate invalid complaints; however, challenges would not be subject

                        parties. Withdrawal would be subject to the presentation of reasonable
                        evidence of non-compliance to the international oversight group or a
                        consultative committee established for the purpose of reviewing
                        complaints/evidence.</p>
                    <p>(S) The above outline is very broad and lacks substantial details necessary
                        to a workable agreement. Nonetheless, it does indicate a reasonable approach
                        and provides a basis for discussion and negotiation. It is applicable to a
                        bilateral <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss> agreement or to a multilateral agreement; however, it is
                        aimed primarily at constraining the Soviet Union since the Soviets pose the
                        only major <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> threat to our forces. It is
                        recognized that other countries, such as the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                            >PRC</gloss>, also possess offensive <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>
                        capabilities, but <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> attack by these
                        countries can be adequately deterred by threat of nuclear or other
                        retaliation. Nuclear deterrence of Soviet <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>
                        use is less credible, however, because of their increasing tactical nuclear
                        capability. For this reason, it would be in our overall best interests to
                        enter into an acceptable agreement along the lines outlined with the Soviets
                        even if there were no other states party thereto.</p>

                    <p>The Army request for $15.3 million provides for establishment of a
                        government-owned and operated facility at Pine Bluff Arsenal, Arkansas, to
                        produce initially binary chemical (GB nerve agent) artillery projectiles.
                        This project will provide for the rehabilitation of an existing building and
                        the purchase and installation of equipment necessary for:</p>
                    <p>—The manufacture of one of the two binary chemical components (the other to
                        be obtained commercially).</p>
                    <p>—Filling and sealing the manufactured chemical component into a canister.</p>
                    <p>—Loading, assembling and packing the projectile by inserting the filled
                        canister and explosive charge into the projectile and placing a fibre-board
                        spacer in place of the second chemical component which is to be stored
                        separately.</p>
                    <pb n="703" facs="0737" xml:id="pg_703"/>
                    <p>The request does not presume a commitment to produce binary munitions.
                        Approximately two years would be required to prepare the facility for
                        production.</p>

                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has a no first-use obligation for
                        lethal and incapacitating chemical weapons by virtue of being a party to the

                        chemical warfare policy stems from <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss>
                        35, dated 25 November 1969. This <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss>
                        states, in part, that “the objective of the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> [chemical warfare] program will be to deter the use of
                        chemical weapons by other nations and to provide a retaliatory capability if
                        deterrence fails.” The <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> maintains a
                        stockpile of chemical weapons for the purpose of implementing this
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>The United States is firmly committed to the objective of complete and
                        effective prohibition of all chemical weapons. This commitment has been
                        reiterated on many occasions by the President and other senior
                        officials.</p>
                    <p>Under Article IX of the Biological Weapons Convention, the United States has
                        an obligation “to continue negotiations in good faith with a view to
                        reaching early agreement on effective measures” for the prohibition of
                        chemical weapons. To this end, the United States has entered into both
                        multilateral and bilateral <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>–<gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> discussions of possible limitations.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Pending Policy Issues</p>
                    <p>The National Security Council has had under study two broad issues in the
                        area of chemical warfare policy. <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 157
                        addressed possible treaty alternatives for achieving restraints on the
                        possession of chemical weapons, and <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss>
                        192 examined alternatives for the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        chemical warfare posture, mainly aimed at the question of whether or not to
                        proceed with the acquisition of binary <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>
                        munitions.</p>
                    <p>Two Senior Review Group meetings were held to consider the alternatives
                        developed in these two <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> studies, but
                        no consensus emerged on the closely-linked issues of the military need for
                        modernization of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> stockpile and acceptable <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> treaty restraints where the verification of
                        compliance is incomplete. Rather than moving these issues to the President
                        for resolution and decision, it was decided to wait the outcome of an
                        internal <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> reassessment of its position
                        on binary acquisition and acceptable arms control approaches. This
                        reassessment has recently been concluded, and the results are reflected in
                        the Secretary of Defense’s memorandum at enclosure 1. That memorandum
                        proposes:</p>

                    <p>—Deferral for a reasonable time of binary production, pending the outcome of

                    <p>The first of these is the subject of the present <gloss target="#t_SRG_1"
                            >SRG</gloss>. The third would be the basis for another <gloss

                        consensus on a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> treaty proposal in our
                        bilateral discussions with the Soviet Union as well as in the <gloss

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Military Considerations</p>
                    <p>The Defense Department’s evaluation indicates that a serious asymmetry exists
                        between the chemical warfare capabilities of the U.S./NATO and USSR/Warsaw
                        Pact forces, and this imbalance poses a significant threat to <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>—Available intelligence reveals that the chemical warfare posture of the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> far outranks that of any other
                        nation and that they are actively engaged in maintaining their superior
                        capabilities. Warsaw Pact forces are well equipped to operate in a toxic
                        environment, particularly one of their own choosing and training for <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> operations receives high priority. The
                        Soviets are known to have a variety of chemical munitions in significant
                        quantity and recent evidence indicates that some chemical weapons are
                        deployed at forward air bases. Soviet forces include over 200 chemical units
                        and about 100,000 depicted <gloss target="#t_CBR_1">CBR</gloss> personnel.
                        They have conducted some 18 open air tests of chemical weapons during the
                        past two years.</p>
                    <p>—In contrast <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and other <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> forces are deficient in both defensive
                        and retaliatory (offensive) capabilities, particularly the latter. Some
                        members of the Alliance possess the ability to conduct operations for a
                        limited time on a chemical battlefield, others patently do not. With the
                        exception of a limited French stockpile, only the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> has any chemical munitions in Europe and these are in
                        short supply and consist only of artillery ammunition. Further, <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> stocks in theater are all located in one
                        supply facility and vulnerable to a preemptive strike. Resupply to the
                        theater is a tenuous proposition. Early warning of impending need would be
                        required to mount an effective resupply mission without seriously crippling
                        other logistic operations. Even given the ability to move efficiently the
                            <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> presently in <gloss
                            target="#t_CONUS_1">CONUS</gloss>, deficiencies in the retaliatory
                        stockpile would still remain, e.g., limited variety, volume, and appropriate
                        type of munitions. A status of the current <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> retaliatory stockpile is shown in
                        enclosure 2.</p>
                    <p>Although Soviet intentions concerning the first use of <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> munitions are not clear, the fact that they
                        are able to attack <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> targets in depth
                        with <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> presents a risk which causes serious
                        concern. Currently, the funding priority for chemical warfare is devoted to
                        improving our <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> protective posture (see
                        enclosure 3). This is consistent with expressed Congressional desires.</p>
                    <p>The proponents of the Army’s <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 78 request
                        take the position that these improvements in <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> defensive posture are not sufficient <pb
                            n="705" facs="0739" xml:id="pg_705"/>to offset the growing obsolescence
                        and possible deterioration in the effectiveness of our current <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> stockpile. If the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> is to have a credible deterrent consistent with our
                        present national policy, it must demonstrate both a capability to protect
                        itself against <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> attack and to retaliate in
                        kind. At the very least we must be prepared to modernize our retaliatory
                        capability by constructing a binary munition facility. The request for funds
                        to purchase long lead-time items required for a binary <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> production facility does not presume a
                        decision to produce, but it is necessary to our maintaining a credible
                            <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> deterrence since it would protect our
                        options regarding possible modernization of the retaliatory stockpile. As
                        indicated above, the proposed program requires two years to complete. Thus,
                        even if funds are provided to begin the program in <gloss target="#t_FY_1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1978, it will be 1979–80 before production could begin.
                        Continued delay in starting the program will further aggravate an already
                        serious readiness deficiency.</p>
                    <p>Those opposing the Army’s proposal to construct a binary production facility
                        argue that it is unnecessary, at least at this time. The military <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> situation is a relatively stable one.
                        Whatever deficiencies are thought to exist in the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> chemical weapons stockpile—for example, virtually no
                        deployment in Europe and a small fraction of total agent in a readily
                        deliverable form—have been present for many years. This situation was
                        considered sufficiently tolerable that no request for the binary facility
                        was included in the budget request last year. A lack of urgency is also
                        indicated by the fact that the Army’s testing program on possible lethality
                        deterioration in filled munitions is scheduled to take four years. Since
                        this information would be an important factor in deciding to produce
                        binaries, the commitment to a production facility now would appear to be
                        premature. Meanwhile, the overall military situation seems to be improving
                        since major improvements are already under way in <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss> defense readiness, which provides an important deterrent to
                        chemical attack.</p>
                    <p>The opponents also question whether the threat of retaliation in kind is the
                        most effective or credible deterrent to a chemical attack. Approval of the
                        production facility is not necessary to keep open the option of improving
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> stockpile until that basic issue is
                        resolved. The option will continue to exist.</p>
                    <p>It should be noted that modernization of the <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss> stockpile could also be accomplished by filling new
                        munitions from present bulk stocks of nerve agent. This method has severe
                        shortcomings, however, when compared to the binary concept. Binaries provide
                        significant advantages in manufacturing, storage, surveillance,
                        transportation, and eventual disposal of chemical munitions. Thus, they not
                        only serve to satisfy environmental concerns, but also allow flexibility in
                        deployment. It is estimated that the time necessary to ready a facility for
                            <pb n="706" facs="0740" xml:id="pg_706"/>production and the over-all
                        costs involved in the manufacture of sufficient munitions to satisfy
                        stockpile deficiencies are roughly the same regardless of the method

                    <p>Present <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet discussions of <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> restraints stem from the July 1974 Summit in
                        Moscow. In the communiqué, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> “agreed to consider a joint

                        the conclusion . . . of an international convention dealing with the most
                        dangerous, lethal means of chemical warfare.” Shortly thereafter, the
                        Soviets presented a draft treaty which is deficient in that it limits only
                        the most toxic chemicals and lacks effective verification measures.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> did not respond to the Soviet draft
                        before the Vladivostok summit in November 1974. (Although no definitive
                        response has been provided, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        forwarded request for clarification on April 29, 1975.) That November 1974

                    <p>On a number of occations since the Vladivostok summit, the Soviets proposed
                        that bilateral consultations begin, but the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> did not accept until mid-1976. The first round of
                        consultations was held in Geneva, in late August 1976. This session dealt
                        with a variety of technical issues related to <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss> limitations, particularly in the areas of scope and
                        verification. It was agreed that the consultations had been useful and that
                        they would be continued at a time to be determined.</p>
                    <p>Since the August 1976 consultations, there has been no further substantive
                        discussion of <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> restraints with the
                        Soviets. The Soviets submitted a memorandum to the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1"
                            >UNGA</gloss> suggesting that they may be willing to discuss provisions
                        for limited forms of on-site inspection. This appears to some to be a
                        reflection of a basic Soviet decision on on-site inspection made in
                        connection with negotiation of the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>
                        Treaty. However, until further talks are held it will be difficult to judge

                        began in earnest in 1972. The United States has participated actively in the
                            <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss>’s discussions, which have focused
                        on the study of technical issues related to scope and verification of
                        various types of limitations. Draft conventions to prohibit chemical weapons
                        have been proposed by the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, Japan, and

                    <p>During the summer 1976 session of the <gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss>,
                        discussions of <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> issues were more active

                        likely to remain at least as active during the spring 1977 session and that
                        they will focus on the proposal presented by the British in August 1976 for
                        a phased prohibition of chemical weapons. Among other members of the <gloss

                            <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> superiority and thus provide a
                        realistic basis for arms control negotiations. <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> discussions
                        concerning a <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> limitation have been under
                        way for several years, although formal discussion has only taken place
                        recently. The Soviets have consistently maintained that on-site verification
                        of <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> limitation is unacceptable. Recent
                        Soviet statements on this matter do not indicate any significant change in
                        their position. Soviet offers to “consider” on-site inspection have been
                        limited to agent destruction only and, even here, they have been purposely
                        vague concerning their intent. As the situation stands now, the prospect for
                        an effective agreement appears dim. The Soviets cannot help but be aware of
                        their advantages in <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> and there is no
                        reason to expect them to give them up. If we seriously expect the Soviets to
                        negotiate away their warfighting capability, we may first have to convince
                        them that we are willing to improve our stockpile should arms control
                        efforts fail.</p>
                    <p>Those opposing the Army’s request believe that:</p>
                    <p>—Given the attitudes in Congress and among some of our <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> allies, it is unrealistic to expect that
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> can remedy whatever offensive
                            <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> deficiencies exist in <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. German opposition to increased
                        peacetime forward deployment of <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> is a
                        critical factor, and one that is not based on environmental and safety
                        concerns, and hence one that will not be overcome by <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> production of the safer binary munitions. Our most
                        promising strategy in attempting to moderate the Warsaw Pact <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> capabilities is to seek treaty restraints on

                        to the extent that the Army’s request would be perceived, both in the <gloss

                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> commitment to attempt to achieve further
                        limitations, it could work against our interest.</p>
                    <p>—Progress has been made recently, during a period in which the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> exercised restraint on the question of
                        preparations for the production of binary chemical weapons. For example,
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> views on the need to find solutions
                        to verification issues have won increased support. At the same time the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> appears to be approaching the
                        remaining problems involved in negotiation of effective <gloss

                        manner than previously. A decision to construct a binary facility at this
                        time might well send the wrong signal to the Soviet government, leading them
                        to conclude that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is not serious
                        about seeking <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> limitations.</p>
                    <p>—A budget request for the binary chemical weapon production facility should
                        not be viewed as a way to facilitate negotiations by increasing pressure on
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Failure to reach agreement on
                            <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> limitations so far cannot be
                        attributed to Soviet intransigence, since the <gloss target="#t_US_1"

                        agreed to provide statutory language prohibiting the production of lethal
                        binary chemical munitions unless the President certifies that it would be in
                        the national interest. This was codified in Section 818, Public Law 94–106,
                        October 6, 1975, as follows:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>“(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, none of the funds
                            authorized by this or any other Act shall be used for the purpose of
                            production of lethal binary chemical munitions unless the President
                            certifies to Congress that the production of such munitions is essential
                            to the national interest to do so and submits a full report to the
                            President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives
                            as far in advance of the production of such munitions as possible.</p>
                        <p>“(b) For the purpose of this section the terms ‛lethal binary chemical
                            munitions’ means (1) any toxic chemical (solid, liquid, or gas) which,
                            through its chemical properties, is intended to be used to produce
                            injury or death to human beings, and (2) any unique device, instrument,
                            apparatus, or contrivance, including any components or accessories
                            thereof, intended to be used to disperse or otherwise disseminate any
                            such toxic chemical.”</p>

                    <p>(Note: Although the above law is concerned specifically with production and,

                        obtained. If the President approves the inclusion of the binary production

                        indicate to Congress that while pursuing vigorously international treaty

                        <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: The problem as I understand
                        it is that the DoD proposal for $15 million in the budget for a binary
                            <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> production facility was turned down.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RDH_1">Don Rumsfeld</persName> reclamaed and it
                        was agreed to have this meeting. I think we all know the DoD position. My
                        question is what is the relationship between the budget proposal and DoD’s
                        draft <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> treaty. What happens if you don’t
                        get the funds?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_WJP_1">Wade</persName>: We are trying to move to
                        improve our <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> posture. This is now more
                        important and has a higher priority because we have taken no action in the
                        last couple of years. The binary facility is a long-lead item and an
                        important element in our <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> posture.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: But how do you handle
                        Congress. Is this just a bargaining chip?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_WJP_1">Wade</persName>: If we brief Congress frankly
                        about what we know regarding the Russian <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>
                        program, I think we could get Congressional support.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: You wish to begin
                        modernization and start preparing to produce binaries in two years, and at
                        the same time we would begin to negotiate. We would also continue <gloss
                            target="#t_RD_1">R&amp;D</gloss> in the <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss> area.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_WJP_1">Wade</persName>: The possibility of an
                        acceptable international agreement limiting <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss> is not high.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: We are trying to keep the
                        binary option open.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: Suppose we put the money in
                        the budget. Then maybe Congress would say to hell with it. What does that do
                        to our leverage at the negotiating table.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_WJP_1">Wade</persName>: The two should be linked.
                        Frank discussions with Congress would help bring them around. We can’t
                        maintain a balance in Europe using only our mechanized forces. We have to
                        increase the pressure against Soviet use of <gloss target="#t_CW_1"
                            >CW</gloss>. We have been stalemated for the last couple of years and
                        the problem needs to be faced up to.</p>
                    <p>Ikle: We don’t have a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> negotiating
                        position on <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>. In a year’s time we could
                        probably get an agreement, but without verification.</p>
                    <pb n="711" facs="0745" xml:id="pg_711"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: The <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> could not accept an agreement without verification.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: There is some give on the
                        Soviets’ part in that area.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Even if we started to produce
                        binaries, it is doubtful that it would give us much leverage in verification
                        negotiations. There would not be much leverage coming out of a small
                        production facility. The leverage would have to result from political
                        factors. The problem is that we have been sitting on the fence for so long.
                        I don’t think we should go ahead at this time with a production facility. It
                        does not require all that much lead time.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_WJP_1">Wade</persName>: This is a long lead item which
                        requires two years.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: But in a real emergency, it
                        might not take that long.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: I am comparing the $15.8
                        million under question vs the $8.8 million in the <gloss target="#t_FY_1"
                            >FY</gloss> 76 budget for ordering long delivery items. Are we talking
                        about two different things?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_WJP_1">Wade</persName>: $2 million is for
                        rehabilitation and $13 million is for equipment.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: So that figure includes
                        the equipment and the installation.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_WJP_1">Wade</persName>: It could be a significant half
                        step forward and might be useful in the negotiations. I cannot say
                        definitely what effect it might have.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: If there were an impasse, it
                        might help.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DTD_1">Davies</persName>: But we have never made a
                        negotiating proposal.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: What is in the Soviet draft
                        treaty, a total ban?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DTD_1">Davies</persName>: Yes, eventually.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: It is for new production:
                        They won’t destroy the facilities they have.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: It presents us with massive
                        verification problems. We can, though, observe the destruction of
                        facilities. Once the negotiations start there may be some give on the Soviet
                        side.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: I have some technical
                        questions. One question is about the efficiency of the binary artillery
                        shell vis-à-vis the present one.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_WJP_1">Wade</persName>: There is no degradation. They
                        are the same.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DTD_1">Davies</persName>: There is slight degradation
                        on a per pound basis.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: You don’t get something for
                        nothing.</p>
                    <p>Mahlberg: It is not militarily significant.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: My second question is that
                        effective use of <gloss target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss> requires lots of shells
                        concentrated in one area. Given the limitation on tubes, wouldn’t you have
                        to cut back on some conventional artillery support?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_WJP_1">Wade</persName>: It depends on your objectives.
                        There are different scenarios.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DTD_1">Davies</persName>: We are short of artillery
                        today.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: <persName corresp="#p_HAMJ_1"

                    <p>Sonnenfeldt: Are binaries the answer?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: They would be of some use. We
                        have none today.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: Why is our proposed response
                        an offensive one? Why not have a substantial increase in our defensive
                        capabilities?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_WJP_1">Wade</persName>: If we go into a completely
                        defensive posture that gives the Soviets the option to attack at a time and
                        place of their choosing.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: We are only talking about $15
                        million.</p>

                        of much larger expenses in the future. Don’t the Soviets have an active
                        program of protective measures?</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Yes, but it is all in one
                        place. In case of a war you could ship more over if there were time.
                        Binaries would give you some advantage.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: We can easily sit here and
                        quick-talk ourselves out of this decision.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: I was explaining your side of
                        the story and saying that one of the reasons for going to binaries is that
                        it would be easier to ship.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: I misunderstood you.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: My understanding is that
                        if a decision is made to go ahead that in ten years the cost would add up to
                        $1 billion. A long lead time of two years is required. The State Department
                        feeling generally is that we haven’t really explored the possibility of an
                        agreement with the Soviets. We have not made a counter offer. If we fail in
                        an effort to get the Congress to spend the $15 million, it would weaken our
                        bargaining position. Then there is the problem of West Germany. They would
                        not be impressed by our assurances on safety. For the Germans there are more
                        important psychological and political concerns. We would have a problem in
                        determining what we could store in a forward position. State feels we should
                        not go ahead at the present time.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: The German position is
                        fundamental. Perhaps we should see if we can get the Germans to agree to
                        store binaries.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: Congress has turned it down
                        the last two years. The two main problems are how to get it in the budget
                        and how to get it through Congress.</p>
                    <p>Sonnenfeldt: We need to make some sort of answer to the Russians. It has been
                        a year and a half.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: I am worried about a full
                        blown proposal being killed in Congress. Many of the people up there say
                        let’s try first to negotiate. We should have talks with the Russians about
                        verification. These could be technical talks about how to verify without
                        saying to them what we propose. We could tell Congress that on the basis of
                        these technical talks we plan to develop a negotiating position next
                        fall.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_WJP_1">Wade</persName>: It might be a viable way to
                        start. Congress might accept it.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: We could put it in the
                        budget and tell Congress that we are going ahead to have serious talks with
                        the Russians.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: We should have a larger
                        reexamination of our position in light of verification problems. The present
                        stockpile in the Soviet Union is a key problem. We could probably agree to
                        cut down on new production and verify that. We can verify the visible things
                        but there is no way to verify the stockpiles. There is some disingenuousness
                        in our position.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: (to <persName
                            corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>) Your compromise seems palatable to
                        me personally but I don’t know about the Department. If you could give me a
                        draft of your proposal I could take it back so that we could reconsider our
                        position. Basically we are opposed to the $15 million expenditure. However
                        your suggestion might cause us to reconsider.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: My proposal is that we would
                        put the $15 million in the budget. Simultaneously we would propose to the
                        Russians and also inform Congress that we are prepared to hold technical
                        talks with the Russians on verification and the limitation of chemical
                        weapons and on the basis of these talks we could make a proposal. We would
                        use that decision with Congress and go along on a parallel track. If the
                        arms control discussions succeed then the binaries are irrelevant. If they
                        don’t work then we will have to face up to a major threat.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ODG_1">Ogilvie</persName>: Look. It is a long time

                        1977. No commitment could be made for at least a year. We have the option of
                        telling the Soviets of our intentions and to start negotiating with them
                        now. We would so advise Congress. We could use this as a bargaining chip
                        with the Soviets and see if we can or cannot get an agreement.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: That is illusory. You could
                        not get an agreement in that time providing for verification.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: There are two ways of having
                        an agreement. One would be without verification. The second would be a

                        <persName corresp="#p_ODG_1">Ogilvie</persName>: I have real worries about

                        the verification issue.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ODG_1">Ogilvie</persName>: With regard to the budget
                        there is a technical problem. Even if we acted today it would be extremely
                        difficult to get the numbers changed. We could do it today or possibly as
                        late as Monday. The budget is in page proof now and we expect to lock it in
                        final very shortly. In order to get a change in the budget we would have to
                        go to the President and we would need a memo for the President. This would
                        be very difficult in such a short time. The other option is to keep the
                        budget as is and have the President submit a supplemental.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: Would there have to be a

                        <persName corresp="#p_WJP_1">Wade</persName>: Only for actual binary

                        <persName corresp="#p_ODG_1">Ogilvie</persName>: There are legal differences
                        of interpretation. It would be interpreted as a production decision and
                        would require a Presidential determination.</p>
                    <p>Sonnenfeldt: It is not a production decision, it is just a decision to keep
                        our options open.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ODG_1">Ogilvie</persName>: That would not reflect the
                        intent of Congress. They would view this as a production decision requiring
                        a determination.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: Well if the President
                        approves the $15 million, there should not be any problem in getting a

                        <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: So there is no consensus in

                        <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: Right. We would like to
                        reserve our vote until we can review the paper to the President outlining
                        the alternatives.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Our view is that it should not
                        be put in the budget. Although the $15 million is a small amount it would be
                        a red flag and cause a great deal of commotion on the <persName

                        flagged as an important issue in the Defense posture statement. A new
                        negotiating position is not for us to develop but for the new

                        <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: We could have an agreement in

                        <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: All we could say is that we

                        <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: There should be some

                        The reason is verification problems.</p>
                    <p>Sonnenfeldt: If the President were to advocate this, he could say that we
                        have been unable to make a responsible statement on the subject because of
                        verification problems, and, secondly, he could mention the cumulative effect
                        of Soviet forces in the area. The other possibility is that we need to use
                        more imagination to see if there is some way to negotiate. There is nothing
                        lost by waiting another year to update the facility and resolve our problems
                        with our Allies. We could make one more major effort.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ODG_1">Ogilvie</persName>: If it is not in then we
                        have until September to ask for a supplement.</p>
                    <p>Sonnenfeldt: In the memo to the Pres it should be pointed out that if we put
                        the money in and Congress then takes it out, we lose leverage.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: The variable is to what
                        extent the Russians will let us inspect. If they agree to inspection it is a
                        new ball game. We should explore that and see how they feel about it. We
                        could make a proposal that both sides destroy X tons and no more. Something
                        like that could be verified.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DTD_1">Davies</persName>: Is the remainder of military
                        consequence?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: $15.3 does not bother me.
                        I am concerned with the rationale. What can be achieved is the important
                        thing.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: What if you assume that
                        Congress will go along with having the $15 million. Would that give you
                        leverage?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: It might give you some
                        leverage.</p>
                    <p>Sonnenfeldt: We would lose leverage if it squeaks by Congress. The opposition
                        would then become more vociferous. There could be an outcry and controversy
                        and Congress might then reverse itself.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_WJP_1">Wade</persName>: The timing of the presentation
                        is important. We could advise Congress we are starting technical talks but
                        that we would not spend money for a year.</p>
                    <p>Sonnenfeldt: That would get you leverage but it is risky.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: If this scenario leads you to
                        residual stocks, then it is better to have these stocks in binaries.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: Your worry about Congress
                        might be true. But on the other hand there is growing concern in the country
                        regarding the fundamental imbalance of power between us and the Russians. I
                        have <pb n="716" facs="0750" xml:id="pg_716"/>just been going through our
                        posture statement. It is depressing. It is awful. I think we are going to
                        start getting a reaction in this country. In the next year the new team, the
                        general public and Congress will all be educated.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: First we should have a
                        position on negotiations. In light of that perhaps a production facility
                        would be in order.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: You are still opposed to the
                        $15 million now?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_IFC_1">Iklé</persName>: Yes, it is putting things in
                        reverse order.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ODG_1">Ogilvie</persName>: If you take this to the
                        President it is important that <persName corresp="#p_MJO_1">Jack
                            Marsh</persName> have some input. He was involved originally when the
                        President expressed his concern about the public reaction. This is more than
                        a meeting of the <gloss target="#t_SRG_1">SRG</gloss>. It is a budget
                        decision that <persName corresp="#p_MJO_1">Marsh</persName> was originally
                        involved with.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: There is no agreement to
                        recommend that the budget be reversed. That split should be reported to the
                        President. DoD through <persName corresp="#p_RDH_1">Don Rumsfeld</persName>
                        has the right to reclama. I will report to <persName corresp="#p_SBA_1"
                            >Brent Scowcroft</persName> that there was no agreement. It was 2 vs 2.
                        DoD will reclama thru <persName corresp="#p_LJT_1">Lynn</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The Meeting ended at 4:03 pm.</p>
